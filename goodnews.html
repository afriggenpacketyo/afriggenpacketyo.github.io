          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court extended a temporary injunction against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants, remanding the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court found that the government had not provided the migrants with sufficient time or information to contest their removals. The majority emphasized the importance of balancing national security interests with constitutional rights. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, while President Trump criticized the ruling on Truth Social.</p>

          <p>A CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The research, one of the last from the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs, found that 51 drowning deaths could be prevented with better pool fencing and 297 with life jackets. This could save thousands of dollars in medical spending and $4.5 billion in economic costs. The study highlights the potential for existing strategies to significantly reduce drowning incidents.</p>

Council executed a SIM swap attack to gain control of the phone number linked to the SEC's account.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway significantly increased its stake in Constellation Brands, a major purveyor of premium beer, wine, and spirits, despite the stock's recent struggles. Constellation has not performed well in recent years, underperforming the broader market. This move aligns with Warren Buffett's value investing strategy, which involves buying stocks trading at less than their intrinsic value. The traditional alcohol sector has faced challenges due to changing consumer preferences, but Buffett's increased investment suggests he sees potential value in Constellation Brands.</p>
