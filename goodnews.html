          <p>Anduril, a defense technology company, has topped the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, highlighting the increasing interest and investment in defense tech. This marks the first time a defense tech company has led the list in its 13-year history, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also featured. The growth in the sector is driven by increased funding, with Anduril recently securing a $2.5 billion round, and a focus on modernizing military capabilities. The Trump administration's proposed increase in defense spending and the rise of dual-use technologies are contributing factors to this trend.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley is introducing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning with some liberal members of Congress. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would increase the minimum wage starting in 2026 and adjust for inflation. Vermont Democratic Senator Peter Welch is co-sponsoring the bill. Hawley's move challenges conservative orthodoxy, reflecting the party's shift towards populism. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since 2009.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Yosemite National Park have successfully helped the Northwestern pond turtle recover by removing invasive American bullfrogs from their habitat. The bullfrogs, which consume turtle hatchlings and other native species, had decimated the turtle population. After removing approximately 16,000 bullfrogs, researchers observed the return of younger turtles and other native species, restoring the food web. This study demonstrates a potential strategy for reversing the decline of certain species and restoring freshwater ecosystems, though it requires intensive and ongoing efforts.</p>
