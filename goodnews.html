          <p>Following the U.S. and China's agreement to suspend most tariffs for 90 days, President Trump stated he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who intends to increase investments in the United States. Trump mentioned Cook plans to construct numerous plants in the U.S. and increase the amount of Apple's overall U.S. investment. Apple had previously announced intentions to invest $500 billion to expand operations in the U.S., including assembling AI servers in Houston. The tariff pause is anticipated to benefit Apple, as most of its device production occurs in China, and the region is its third-largest market by sales.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an initiative to lower U.S. prescription drug prices to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening pharmaceutical companies with price caps if they don't comply. Trump stated the U.S. would no longer subsidize healthcare for foreign countries and aimed for immediate price reductions of 50% to 90%. The plan involves reviving the 'most favored nation' policy, which was previously blocked by courts, and allowing Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at these lower prices. The pharmaceutical industry opposes this, arguing it would stifle innovation and harm profits.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (P.K.K.) announced that it would lay down its arms and disband, a decision that could reshape Turkish politics and influence other Kurdish militias. This announcement follows calls from the imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to disarm and pursue Kurdish rights through political means. The P.K.K., classified as a terrorist organization, has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state for four decades. This move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war with China largely suspended as China ignored Trump's stern warning of no retaliation. China retaliated with countermeasures, imposing tariffs on American imports. Trump decided to make an example of the country, but held out for one month before backing down. There is a lesson here for everybody Trump threatens, whether countries or businesses or universities: Although Trump instructs his targets to submit, doing so merely sets them up for more humiliation and abuse.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields increased following the U.S. and China's agreement to reduce tariffs, signaling investor optimism about avoiding a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.431%, and the 2-year Treasury yield jumped to 3.983%. The trade deal involves lowering tariffs, with effective U.S. tariffs on China at 30%. Analysts believe this thaw in trade relations will provide the Federal Reserve with more flexibility. The likelihood of near-term rate cuts from the Fed has decreased as the U.S. may avoid a recession.</p>

However, the Qatari Media Attach√© disputed reports that the plane will be gifted during this trip. Democratic Rep.
