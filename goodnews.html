          <p>China has completed a record-setting hydropower turbine with a 500-megawatt capacity, the largest single-unit capacity in the world. Developed by Harbin Electric Machinery Company, the 80-tonne turbine is destined for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station on a tributary of the Nu River in Tibet. Constructed from durable martensitic steel, this massive component is considered the "heart" of the new hydropower unit and represents a significant engineering achievement for the country's renewable energy infrastructure. This project underscores China's ongoing investment in large-scale green energy solutions.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic revival, with new listing volumes reaching $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This surge, fueled by Chinese companies seeking listings, positions the city to potentially surpass New York and Nasdaq as the world's top listing destination. Factors driving the boom include supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of A-share listings in mainland China, and strong capital inflows from mainland investors. This renewed activity marks a significant turnaround from several years of lackluster performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that effectively banned migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The order, issued on Trump's first day in office, had characterized the border situation as an "invasion." Immigrant rights groups, including the ACLU, praised the ruling as a critical affirmation that the president must adhere to existing immigration statutes.</p>

The 76-year-old rock legend, who has battled numerous health issues including Parkinson's disease, will reunite with his original bandmates for a massive stadium show. The event, titled "Back to the Beginning," celebrates the band that pioneered the heavy metal genre and an artist who became a symbol of rock and roll excess. Despite previous retirement threats, this concert is widely seen as the definitive swansong for one of music's most enduring and wild personalities.</p>

The agreement spans goods, services, investment, and intellectual property. This pact follows a similar deal Mercosur reached with the European Union, which has faced ratification challenges, making this agreement with the non-EU EFTA nations of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein a significant achievement.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers will have three players in the National League's starting lineup for the 2025 MLB All-Star Game: designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, catcher Will Smith, and first baseman Freddie Freeman. Despite having eight finalists in the fan vote, the team fell short of the all-time record of five starters from a single team. The article notes the other five Dodgers finalists were outvoted for their positions. The piece also provides historical context on past teams that dominated All-Star starting lineups, including the 1976 Cincinnati Reds, and explains that the full rosters will be announced later.</p>

Coach Pia Sundhage remains hopeful, urging her team to focus on their remaining group games to achieve their goal of reaching the quarter-finals.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will set U.S. tariffs on Vietnamese imports at 20 percent. This new rate is a reduction from a threatened 46 percent levy that was part of a broader plan for "reciprocal" tariffs. Under the deal, Vietnam will reportedly charge no tariffs on U.S. products, opening its markets to American goods. The agreement also includes a steeper 40 percent tariff on goods that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice the administration has sought to curtail, particularly concerning Chinese products.
