          <h2>Soybean Industry Expresses Concerns Over Ongoing Tariff Costs Despite Reductions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the American Soybean Association informed US senators that even with recent tariff reductions between the US and China, the costs remain excessively high for US soybean farmers. Despite temporary tariff reductions, US soybeans still face substantial duties in the Chinese market, nearly equivalent to the height of the 2018 trade war. Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, emphasized that while alternative markets have been explored, they cannot fully replace the sheer volume of demand from China. The US sells more soybeans to China than any other product, and these tariffs continue to significantly impact the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that despite recent investment deals between the US and Saudi Arabia, China's established presence in the region remains strong as both countries vie for influence. China's capabilities in manufacturing and infrastructure development are considerable amid increasing competition in high-tech sectors. Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar, noted that US relations with Gulf states are expected to strengthen, increasing US influence in the Middle East during the second Trump administration. This competition ultimately benefits Saudi Arabia, allowing them to leverage both powers to their advantage.</p>

Judge Patricia Giles stated that the release was in the public interest to disrupt the chilling effect on protected speech, noting that the government did not provide sufficient evidence for its claims. Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, was detained due to his pro-Palestinian activism, with officials revoking his student visa based on alleged connections of his father-in-law to Hamas and his social media posts.

CEO Adam Aron cited improved box-office results in the fiscal second quarter as a reason for the decision. The initiative is seen as a test to whether it cannibalizes higher-priced attendance on other days, and it could help drive attendance, increase concession sales, and expose audiences to trailers for new films.</p>

However, the deduction phases out for individuals making more than $160,000 a year and expires after 2028.
