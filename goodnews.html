          <h2>Wharton Professor Discusses AI's Impact on the Future of Entry-Level Jobs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick states that while AI is not yet ready to fully replace human jobs, it poses a 'huge concern' for the entry-level workforce. He argues that AI's proficiency in completing basic tasks challenges the traditional apprenticeship model, making it harder for new workers to gain essential expertise. Mollick advises that skills like judgment, taste, and deep knowledge will become more critical, and that companies must rethink entry-level roles as training opportunities. He suggests that jobs with a variety of 'bundled' tasks are more resilient to being fully automated by artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles has initiated a program to deliver food, groceries, and medication to immigrant families who are afraid to leave their homes due to federal immigration raids. Archbishop José H. Gómez stated the initiative is designed to help 'good, hard-working' people who are living in fear of arrest and deportation. The program, supported by donations, will utilize delivery systems established during the pandemic to reach those in need across its 288 parishes. This response comes as nearly 3,000 people have been arrested in Los Angeles by ICE since June.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window is seeing massive spending, dominated by the top clubs from last season. Liverpool leads the way with £269 million spent, including a potential British record for Florian Wirtz, followed by Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester City. This spending spree contrasts sharply with the rest of the league, raising questions about competitive balance. Football finance experts note that despite the high figures, increased revenues mean top clubs like Liverpool are operating well within profit and sustainability rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are claiming Social Security at age 62, the earliest possible age, which locks in a permanently reduced monthly benefit. This article outlines several strategies to avoid this, thereby maximizing lifetime payouts by delaying claims. These include investing in an annuity to create a private income bridge, using a reverse mortgage to tap into home equity for funds, or maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts in the years leading up to retirement. These methods can provide the financial flexibility needed to wait until age 70, when benefits are highest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>President Trump Expresses Confidence in Fed Easing After Meeting with Chair Powell</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump stated he believes the central bank is prepared to start lowering interest rates. Trump interpreted Powell's comments about the country's strong performance as a signal that a policy of easing monetary policy is forthcoming, a move the president has long advocated for. The meeting's positive tone was a shift from previous rancor, though White House officials maintain they will continue to scrutinize the Fed's management. Despite Trump's optimism, futures markets currently assign almost no chance of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The popular Chinese toy brand Pop Mart has opened its first physical store in Germany, drawing hundreds of fans to its Berlin launch. The main attraction is the Labubu, a fluffy, toothy monster toy that has become a global phenomenon, partly due to its 'blind box' packaging which adds an element of surprise. The toy's popularity, fueled by social media trends and celebrity endorsements from stars like Blackpink's Lisa, has been a massive financial success for Pop Mart. The company's revenue more than doubled in 2024, turning it into a multi-billion dollar enterprise with a growing global presence.</p>

After her physician father was laid off in 2020, she was inspired to create more job security by expanding her practice nationwide through telehealth. The process of getting licensed everywhere was arduous and cost her $180,000, but the investment has paid off, as she earned over $870,000 last year. She now runs a private practice in Miami and serves patients across the country, including those in underserved rural and indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>As global powers like China, India, and the Gulf States increase their investment and trade in Africa, Germany is being warned that it risks being left behind. German exports to the region have been stagnant for a decade, despite robust economic growth in many African nations. Business leaders and policymakers are calling for a strategic 'Africa turnaround,' arguing that Germany's reputation for quality and its focus on sustainable local partnerships could be a competitive advantage. However, practical hurdles and a prevailing narrative that perceives the continent as too risky are significant obstacles to increasing German economic engagement.</p>

          <p>While younger generations may be more aware of mental health, depression in older adults is often stigmatized and misdiagnosed as a normal part of aging.

The article emphasizes that social factors like loss and changes in status can trigger or worsen depression in late life.

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker shared that during her early career at age 18, she learned to be very judicious with her money, often making $40 last for three days. While driven by her passion for performing, she acknowledged the importance of financial stability and the 'security in being able to pay your bills.' The article contrasts her early, restrictive budgeting with modern financial advice for freelancers. A financial expert suggests that instead of extreme rationing, those with volatile incomes should focus on a percentage-based 'bucketing strategy' for expenses. (not investment advice)</p>
