          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% while speaking at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania, aiming to further secure the steel industry. Trump stated that at the previous 25%, importers could circumvent the tariffs, but at 50%, it would be much more difficult. He also discussed the merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to maintaining U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of ten years, with no layoffs or outsourcing. U.S. Steel workers will also receive a $5,000 bonus as part of the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Navy has halted all experiments on dogs and cats after receiving a letter from PETA to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan. Navy Secretary John Phelan terminated all Department of the Navy testing on cats and dogs, citing taxpayer savings and inhumane studies. PETA is now urging the Department of Defense to conduct a similar comprehensive audit across all military branches to eliminate waste and abuse in animal experimentation. PETA has requested that the DOD ban the use of animals in Navy decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity tests, as well as prohibit the use of dogs, cats, nonhuman primates, marine animals, and other animals in Army weapon-wounding tests.</p>

          <p>Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from all World Boxing competitions until the boxer undergoes newly mandated genetic sex testing, World Boxing said. The organization announced it will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers who want to participate in their competitions. The decision to mandate testing came in part due to the controversy surrounding Khelif after the boxer won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Athletes will need to take a polymerase chain reaction genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.</p>
