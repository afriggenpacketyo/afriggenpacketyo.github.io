          <p>Datong, a city in China's Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during severe summer rains, despite nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. This resilience is attributed to a major infrastructure project initiated over 15 years ago by former mayor Geng Yanbo, who widened the city's main waterway and reinforced its banks. Initially criticized as a waste due to infrequent rainfall, the investment is now recognized as crucial. Economists suggest such proactive infrastructure spending not only enhances urban resilience in the medium term but also effectively stimulates the economy in the short term, exemplified by Beijing's recent 1 trillion yuan allocation for disaster prevention.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic in Texas plans to reopen next summer, a year after flash floods in the Guadalupe River tragically killed 27 girls and counselors. The camp's reopening will adhere to new safety legislation, fiercely championed by victims' families, which mandates prohibiting cabins in dangerous flood zones, developing detailed emergency plans, and installing warning systems. The devastating floods on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people across Texas and caused widespread destruction. Additionally, the camp will construct a memorial to honor the girls who perished, signifying a commitment to remembrance and improved safety protocols.</p>

The funds are intended to substantially expand Tether's strategy across existing and new business lines, including stablecoins, artificial intelligence, and energy.

          <p>President Donald Trump has articulated a significant shift in his stance on the Ukraine war, now stating that Kyiv is "in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This change in rhetoric, conveyed after discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, departs from Trump's previous suggestions of territorial concessions. Zelenskyy hailed the declaration as a "big shift" and a "positive signal," indicating a belief that Trump now understands the unfairness of territorial swaps. Trump also suggested NATO nations should shoot down Russian aircraft breaching their airspace, though he emphasized European responsibility for funding the war.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully disrupted a sprawling telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area that posed a serious threat to the city's telecom systems and the ongoing UN General Assembly meetings. Investigators discovered active SIM farms across more than five sites, containing over 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. The sophisticated network, linked to foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and drug cartels, was seized within three weeks following telephonic threats to senior U.S. officials. Authorities confirmed the threat has been neutralized, though they caution that other such networks might still exist.</p>

          <p>International health organizations and experts have collectively and strongly refuted claims made by the Trump administration and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., asserting a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children. The European Medicines Agency, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and Australian health authorities all affirmed that robust scientific evidence shows no causal link, maintaining that paracetamol remains a safe option for pregnant women. Spain's Minister of Health criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, while the World Health Organization noted inconsistent evidence, underscoring a broad scientific consensus against these unsupported claims.</p>

          <p>The dismembered body parts of an unknown woman, found along the Willamette River in April 1946, are now believed to be those of Oak Grove Jane Doe, Oregon’s oldest unidentified victim. The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence, including the victim’s remains, mysteriously disappeared from law enforcement custody. However, the remains were recently discovered under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946" at Mountain View Cemetery. State police plan to subject the remains to advanced forensic testing, offering renewed hope to finally resolve this nearly 80-year-old mystery and restore the victim's name and identity to history.</p>
