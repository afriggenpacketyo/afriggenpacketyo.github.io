          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to reach approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is spearheading the effort to address public criticism over ineffective price controls amid rising inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice to major retailers, bypassing the auction system to exert greater influence over prices, while also considering online sales to broaden distribution.</p>
