          <p>A police officer in Santa Monica was shot and seriously injured after approaching a suspect wanted in connection with a previous shooting that injured two teenagers. The incident triggered a manhunt, during which police released a photo of the suspect and received a tip leading to his arrest approximately three hours later. The handgun believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered near the suspect. The officer is in stable condition at a local hospital and is expected to recover from his injuries, and the suspect is believed to be connected to the prior shooting of two teens in a Waymo autonomous taxi. </p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks selected Cooper Flagg, an 18-year-old sensation from Duke, as the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft. Flagg, a consensus college player of the year, averaged 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds while leading Duke to the Final Four. He joins a Mavericks roster already featuring Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, and will wear No. 32 for the team. This pick marks a new era for the Mavericks, following a season of injuries and the trade of Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, which initially sparked fan protests before the team won the NBA Draft Lottery. </p>

          <p>A controversial project to create artificial human DNA from scratch has begun, supported by an initial ¬£10 million grant from the Wellcome Trust. The Synthetic Human Genome Project aims to develop therapies for age-related diseases and generate disease-resistant cells for organ repair. While critics fear the potential for misuse, such as creating modified humans, researchers believe the benefits outweigh the risks. The project marks a significant advancement following the Human Genome Project, allowing scientists to not only read DNA but also create it molecule by molecule. </p>

          <p>UK scientists have developed a test to identify women with abnormal womb linings, increasing their risk of miscarriage, potentially paving the way for new treatments. The test measures signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining, which is being piloted at Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research. One woman, Charlie Beattie, participated in a trial and, after treatment with sitagliptin, had a successful pregnancy after experiencing multiple miscarriages. This research offers an explanation for recurrent miscarriage and hope for women struggling with pregnancy loss. </p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter responded to criticism over the original cover art for her upcoming album, ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Best Friend,‚Äù by releasing an alternative cover. The initial cover, depicting Carpenter on all fours like a dog, drew accusations of promoting sexist stereotypes. The new black-and-white image features Carpenter in an elegant gown leaning against a man in a suit, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe. Carpenter has previously faced backlash for her music video filmed at a church and her suggestive performances on tour, and this new cover provides a different artistic direction. </p>

While the owners of the swap meet denied allowing ICE agents onto the premises, the band ultimately canceled the show due to the discomfort caused by the situation. The musicians rescheduled a performance at the Bricks Restaurant & Sports Bar in Maywood, offering a shorter but still anticipated reunion for their fans. </p>
