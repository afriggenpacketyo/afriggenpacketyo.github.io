          <h2>Investigative Genetic Genealogy Emerges as a Key Tool in Solving Cold Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:28:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The field of investigative genetic genealogy, pioneered by amateur sleuth turned forensic expert Barbara Rae-Venter, is revolutionizing how law enforcement solves cold cases. Rae-Venter famously used public DNA databases and family tree research to identify the Golden State Killer, leading to his arrest after decades of eluding capture. This article details how the same techniques were used to solve the nearly three-decade-old case of a child's sexual assault in Ohio, identifying the perpetrator through his relatives' DNA. The method raises privacy concerns but has proven invaluable for bringing long-sought justice to victims.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:20:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government will introduce measures to make electric cars cheaper to purchase, though she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants. The plan includes a £25 million package for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies," making at-home charging easier for those without driveways, and an additional £63 million for public charging infrastructure. This initiative aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs and "range anxiety," which are significant barriers to adoption ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.</p>

          <p>Women's basketball hall-of-famer Nancy Lieberman has publicly called for WNBA players to embrace the attention and financial growth Caitlin Clark is bringing to the league, rather than showing jealousy. Lieberman compared the situation to how other sports icons like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods elevated their respective sports, suggesting that Clark is the current "cash cow" who will benefit everyone. She urged players to celebrate each other's successes, pointing to stars like Angel Reese and Sabrina Ionescu, and to focus on competing on the court instead of "nitpicking."</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent political economist and adviser to Beijing, argues that Chinese think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He suggests that these organizations should become more "self-centred" and focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic models and textbooks. According to Zheng, this shift would enable them to better explain China's policies and development to the world, providing more accurate analysis and predictions based on the country's own context.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a highly anticipated rematch between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. This marks the first time since the Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal era that the same two men have contested the finals at both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Alcaraz, the 22-year-old defending champion from Spain, is on a 24-match winning streak and defeated Sinner in a grueling five-set match in Paris just five weeks ago. Sinner, also 22, is seeking his first Wimbledon title.</p>

          <p>A retrospective in New York City is celebrating the work of Dutch-American painter Joop Sanders, who was the last surviving member of the original Abstract Expressionist movement when he died in 2023 at age 101. Curated by his granddaughter, Isca Greenfield-Sanders, the exhibit showcases his significant contributions to the first major art movement to originate in the United States. Sanders was a contemporary of Willem de Kooning and participated in the landmark 9th Street Show of 1951, and the show aims to reintroduce his influential work to a new generation.</p>

          <p>This article explores the career and lasting cultural significance of Pamela Anderson, now 58, arguing she is a more complex figure than just a 90s icon. It draws parallels to Marilyn Monroe, noting a "sacrificial" quality, particularly regarding the infamous stolen private video tape that predated modern internet scandals. Despite that violation, Anderson has shown remarkable resilience, reinventing herself through activism, writing, and a recent return to acting. Her recent decision to forgo makeup has also sparked conversations about beauty, aging, and authenticity, cementing her status as an enduring and relevant figure.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara Desert, where it was found in 2023. Known as NWA 16788, the meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet. Its authenticity was confirmed by specialized lab analysis comparing its composition to data from the 1976 Viking Mars probe.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered a previously unknown shipwreck believed to be the L.W. Crane, a vessel that sank in 1880. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was originally mapping other known cultural sites when their high-resolution sonar detected the partially buried 90-foot hull. The L.W. Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in Oshkosh over 140 years ago. The unexpected find highlights the rich maritime history hidden beneath the river's surface.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China has developed a novel biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, or common table sugar. Because methanol can be synthesized from captured carbon dioxide, this breakthrough offers a potential pathway for turning a greenhouse gas into a food source. The process uses enzymes and does not require the land and water resources needed for growing sugar cane or beets. The researchers say their method could be a promising strategy to address both environmental challenges and global food security.</p>
