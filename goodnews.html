          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman defended the company's ambitious plan to spend approximately $850 billion on a massive AI infrastructure buildout in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. The project, equivalent to the power of 17 nuclear plants, is a response to the soaring demand for AI services like ChatGPT. Acknowledging concerns about a potential market bubble, Altman stated that such large-scale infrastructure is necessary to advance AI capabilities and that cycles of overinvestment and underinvestment are typical of technological revolutions.

This downturn in the tech sector occurred alongside a major milestone for Meta, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has surpassed 3 billion monthly active users. The growth is attributed to the success of Reels and AI-driven recommendation systems, which have increased user engagement on the platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has adopted a more conciliatory tone toward Beijing, calling for engagement in a "spirit of mutual understanding" on trade issues. This shift comes as the EU seeks China's cooperation on critical global matters, including the war in Ukraine and climate change. In response, Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged both powers to maintain "strategic independence" amid global instability. The change in rhetoric marks a departure from von der Leyen's previously more assertive stance on China's market practices and export controls.</p>

In a message to the university community, Sister Jean reflected on her years of service and encouraged students to pursue their dreams. University President Mark C.

          <p>Labubu dolls, collectible blind box toys, have become a viral fashion accessory, leading high-end luxury brands to collaborate on premium versions of the inexpensive item. Originally priced at $27, customized Labubus have fetched tens of thousands at auction, and brands like Moynat are launching collections featuring the character. This trend reflects a broader strategy by luxury houses to engage younger, digitally-savvy consumers by incorporating popular characters, similar to past collaborations with Pikachu and Snoopy. The "cute" aesthetic is seen as a strategic way to drive virality and emotional connection with Gen Z customers.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is aiming to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck by offering special financing rates to buyers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. The promotion provides these consumers with lower interest rates usually reserved for those with higher creditworthiness, in an effort to make the vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory. While such programs can increase sales, they also carry a higher risk of loan defaults, especially in an uncertain economy. The move comes as affordability remains a major concern in the auto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This feedback was crucial, leading them to pivot their target market to first-time business owners, a strategy that proved invaluable to their success.

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity rule for "pattern day traders," a significant barrier for smaller retail investors. The rule, established in 2001, required traders making four or more day trades in a five-day period to maintain this minimum balance. It will be replaced with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken during the day, rather than a fixed equity threshold.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a homeowner with a $250,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520. This is about $150 less per month compared to the payments at the beginning of the year when rates were above 7%, resulting in over $54,000 in total interest savings over the life of the loan. The lower rates have spurred an increase in mortgage applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family has shared the story of their son, Mason, who was diagnosed with nonverbal autism and began speaking just days after starting treatment with leucovorin. The drug, a derivative of folic acid typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects, is being studied for its potential to help some children with autism. Researchers theorize it can bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues. While preliminary studies show promise for speech, the drug is not FDA-approved for autism, and researchers face funding challenges because it is an inexpensive generic.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low after a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, this article advises potential homebuyers to ask critical questions before entering the market. Buyers should first determine the actual interest rate they qualify for based on their credit score, as the advertised average may not apply to them. They should also explore alternatives like buying mortgage points or considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to secure an even lower initial rate.
