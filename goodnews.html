          <p>Japan's current account surplus hit a record 30.38 trillion yen in fiscal year 2024, marking the second consecutive year of record highs, driven by significant returns on foreign investments. This data comes amid other economic news, such as China and the U.S. agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism to address trade issues and the WTO Director General planning to meet with Japanese officials to discuss global trade challenges. Meanwhile, South Korea's presidential election campaign has begun, and Japan's corporate bankruptcies for April have reached an 11-year high due to labor shortages and funding difficulties.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and regulations surrounding gifts given to U.S. presidents by foreign powers, highlighting the constitutional rules designed to prevent bribery and corruption. The article notes that gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the United States and are managed by the White House Gift Unit, often ending up in national archives or presidential libraries. The article also discusses instances of missing gifts and the potential ethical concerns of accepting expensive items, such as a luxury plane, while in office, adding that foreign leaders often use gifts to strengthen relationships and break the ice.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is hosting President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other Latin American officials in Beijing, signaling China's intent to maintain a strong presence in the region. This occurs as President Trump aims to bring Latin American countries closer to the U.S., raising concerns about a potential resurgence of the Monroe Doctrine. Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power, offering a geopolitical counterweight to U.S. influence. The meetings will likely address trade relations, with China seeking to purchase more commodities from Latin America, while Latin American countries seek to avoid becoming dumping grounds for Chinese exports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the feasibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands of the UK for the first time in about 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct studies on the potential return of these "keystone" species, which can help create and maintain habitats for diverse wildlife. Key challenges include disease risk assessment and public acceptance, drawing lessons from the successful reintroduction of beavers. The initial plan involves keeping elk and beavers in the same enclosure before potentially releasing elk into the Trent valley.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns have launched a joint bid for the leadership of the Green Party of England and Wales, joining Deputy Leader Zack Polanski in the contest. The move follows Carla Denyer's announcement that she will not seek re-election as co-leader. Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its most ambitious chapter, focusing on national politics in Westminster and winning power across the country. Polanski emphasizes the need to build a mass movement to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. The Green Party recently achieved its best-ever result in the general election, winning seats in four constituencies.</p>

          <p>This article discusses a student-led movement in Serbia protesting against the increasingly autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic. It describes an Easter miracle in which Muslim students from Novi Pazar joined the protests to support their Christian colleagues, and a war veteran's message of inclusion that resonated deeply. The movement, sparked by corruption related to a train station collapse, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in Serbian society. Despite government attempts to defang them, protesters are calling for early elections, demonstrating a commitment to change the country through horizontal decision-making and solidarity.</p>
