          <p>This article discusses the need for China and ASEAN to build trust to align their security interests. Cambodia's allowing foreign warships at its Ream naval base signals inclusivity, countering perceptions of Chinese exclusivity. China's Global Security Initiative aims for peaceful dialogue in resolving disputes, particularly in the South China Sea. For China's vision to be realized, it must demonstrate openness, consistency, and a commitment to multilateral dialogue, fostering lasting trust with its Southeast Asian neighbors and reinforcing regional stability.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by the oil and gas sector and strong performance in tech and finance. The World Bank projects a slight increase to 3.7% in 2025, though agricultural growth remains slow due to insecurity and high input costs. President Tinubu's reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, have been praised, but have also led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians. Despite some relief in food prices, nearly half of Nigerians live in poverty, and inflation is expected to remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the recent surge in gold prices, driven by factors such as unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical uncertainty, and fears of inflation. Central banks have been increasing their gold reserves, contributing to the upward trend. While gold is considered a safe-haven asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations, and past surges have been followed by significant falls. Experts offer differing opinions on whether the current boom is sustainable or if a market bubble is forming. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the question of who should be prescribed GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, arguing that changes in health, particularly the reduction of visceral fat, should be the primary goal, rather than weight alone. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. The article suggests that waist size and blood-lipid patterns are better indicators than BMI for determining who would benefit most from these medications. The author notes that the United States is still deciding how to approach GLP-1s and that more data is needed on their long-term effects.</p>

          <p>Samsung has launched a thin version of its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, in an unusually timed launch. The device is just 5.8 millimeters thin and weighs 163 grams. The launch comes shortly after Samsung reported strong sales for its S25 series, but also warned of decreasing smartphone demand due to economic conditions and tariff policies. The company hopes the S25 Edge will help sustain sales momentum.</p>
