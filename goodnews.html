          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries indicates that parents, compared to childfree individuals, report a greater sense of meaning in their lives but experience lower life satisfaction. This disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers, with life satisfaction levels influenced by factors such as living situation and family policy. Scandinavian countries show less difference in satisfaction between parents and non-parents, attributed to supportive family policies and societal attitudes that view children as a shared community responsibility. Greater gender equality and equal pay also contribute to higher satisfaction among parents.</p>
