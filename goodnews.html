          <p>During its first-ever CEO investor day held in the United States, Hyundai Motor reconfirmed its ambitious growth strategy, aiming for annual sales of 5.55 million units by 2030. The company is increasing its revenue expectations for the current year but has lowered its operating profit margin forecast for 2025, citing ongoing U.S. tariffs. CEO José Muñoz emphasized the U.S. as the "engine of growth," with plans to invest $26 billion to expand American operations. The event occurred amid controversy following a recent immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated battery plant in Georgia.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, with earnings per share falling slightly below Wall Street expectations. However, the company's revenue met forecasts, lifted by strong same-store sales growth of 5.9% at Olive Garden and 5.5% at LongHorn Steakhouse. CEO Rick Cardenas noted an increase in visits from all income groups, suggesting the company's value offerings are attracting customers. Despite the earnings miss, Darden raised its full-year revenue growth forecast, though its stock fell in morning trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. This reduction directly impacts borrowing costs, with the monthly principal and interest payment on a $500,000 mortgage now calculated at approximately $3,040. This represents a saving of about $300 per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. The article illustrates how even modest rate changes can provide significant financial relief for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark collaboration for the U.S. semiconductor industry, Nvidia has announced a $5 billion investment in Intel. The partnership will focus on co-developing data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing expertise with Intel's CPU architecture. The deal, which caused Intel's stock to surge over 24%, marks a significant step in Intel's turnaround efforts, which are also supported by the U.S. government. The collaboration aims to create a new foundation for the next era of computing, though it does not currently include plans for Nvidia to use Intel's manufacturing facilities.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is expanding its presence in Wisconsin with a new $4 billion investment to build a second data center, following a $3.3 billion project for its first facility in the state. The initial data center, set to open in early 2026, will be equipped to handle advanced artificial intelligence workloads using Nvidia's latest GPUs. Microsoft President Brad Smith stated the company is committed to matching its energy consumption with carbon-free sources to avoid raising local electricity costs. This expansion reflects the massive demand for cloud infrastructure driven by the growth of AI technologies.</p>

          <p>The IRS and Treasury Department have finalized a rule from the Secure 2.0 Act that will affect 401(k) catch-up contributions for high-income workers. Starting in 2027, individuals earning over $145,000 from their employer in the previous year must make their catch-up contributions (for those age 50 and older) on a post-tax, or Roth, basis. This change was implemented to help fund the legislation, as Roth contributions are taxed upfront. The rule provides clarity for older, higher-earning retirement savers on how they can contribute additional funds to their workplace plans in the coming years.</p>

The 62-year-old succeeds Bruno Lage, who was dismissed following a surprising Champions League defeat. This marks a return to management for Mourinho less than a month after he was let go by Turkish club Fenerbahce. It is also a homecoming of sorts, as Mourinho began his illustrious managerial career with a brief 10-game stint at Benfica back in 2000.</p>

          <p>Israeli author Ayelet Gundar-Goshen, who is also a psychotherapist, explores the role of writing as resistance in the context of the Israel-Gaza conflict. She describes initially feeling that writing was a privilege amid the suffering, but was motivated to continue when she saw right-wing officials calling for boycotts of art that humanizes Palestinians. In her work, she examines the psychological dynamics of fear and trauma that shape the conflict, arguing for empathy on both sides. She believes that while writing is a powerful tool, it must be combined with direct action and protest to effect real change.</p>

Accompanying "dot plot" projections from committee members indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut rather than a response to a weak economy, creating some market uncertainty. The decision reflects the central bank's delicate balancing act between managing inflation and supporting economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>
