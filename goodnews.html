          <p>Chester-based artist Hayden Richard is gaining attention for a powerful painting of a bald eagle, created to celebrate the spirit of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. The artwork, which focuses solely on the bird to represent strength and freedom, was started even before the team's last Super Bowl victory. After losing his job as a chef, Richard returned to his passion for art, which he has practiced since childhood in Trinidad. He hopes his painting will be acquired by the team's ownership or players, viewing it as a tribute to "Bird Nation."</p>

The actions, which took place across 23 U.S. divisions and seven foreign regions, also resulted in the seizure of vast quantities of fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine. Authorities also confiscated $12.8 million in currency and assets, along with 420 firearms.

Prince Harry visited the Community Recording Studio, an initiative supported by the charity, where he met with youth workers and local groups. He expressed hope that the donation would help create safe spaces and offer a sense of belonging to young people facing challenges like knife crime and inequality.

          <p>China is advancing its "Air Silk Road" initiative, a plan to help develop civil aviation capabilities in dozens of countries, primarily those participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. The strategy aims to enhance air route connectivity with partners in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe by launching new routes and increasing flight frequencies. This campaign is also expected to serve as a platform to promote China's domestically produced aircraft, such as the Comac C919 and C909, on the global market. The move comes as Beijing seeks to strengthen trade and diplomatic ties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural shift towards debt aversion is driving the increasing popularity of debit cards over credit cards in the United States, particularly among younger generations. Many Gen Z consumers, wary of accumulating debt after observing phenomena like the student loan crisis, prefer the direct-from-account nature of debit spending as a way to maintain financial control. In response, financial companies like Venmo and Chime are launching debit cards with rewards programs to attract this demographic. This trend reflects a broader consumer desire to live within their means, even as it alters the landscape of personal finance.</p>

          <p>Americans are feeling more optimistic about their retirement prospects, according to a new report from Natixis Investment Managers. The survey found that only 21% of respondents believe it will "take a miracle" to retire securely, a significant drop from 41% in 2021, partly due to strong stock market performance. However, significant anxieties persist, with 69% worrying about financial instability. Top concerns include outliving their savings, potential cuts to Social Security, and the fear that high inflation will erode the value of their retirement funds over time.</p>
