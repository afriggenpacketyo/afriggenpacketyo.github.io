          <p>The Syrian government has agreed to cooperate with the United States in the search and return of Americans missing in the country, signaling improved relations between the two nations. U.S. envoy Thomas Barrack conveyed this "power step forward" after meeting with Syrian President Ahmed Sharaa, emphasizing the importance of closure for the families of Austin Tice, Majd Kamalmaz, and Kayla Mueller. This announcement follows the Trump administration's decision to grant Syria sanctions exemptions, aimed at enabling the new government to foster conditions for the Syrian people to thrive and defeat ISIS. Barrack also commended President al-Sharaa's commitment to counter-ISIS measures and relations with Israel, reflecting a mutual interest in regional stability. The current administration is hoping to provide the Syrian people with the ability to not only survive, but thrive, with the new exemptions and government. </p>

The strong showing is a relief to theater owners who have struggled with post-pandemic moviegoing habits and the dual writers‚Äô and actors‚Äô strikes in 2023.

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to divert to Seattle after a passenger attempted to open the plane's exit doors mid-flight. The passenger was restrained by fellow passengers and crew members before the plane landed, and was later evaluated by Port of Seattle Police who determined he was having a medical crisis and transported him to a local hospital. A second unrelated incident occurred while the plane was on the tarmac in Seattle, resulting in another passenger being removed by police. The flight eventually continued to Houston, and the airline affirmed that the safety of passengers and crew remains their top priority.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a lead at the first corner and maintaining it throughout the race. The top three drivers, Norris, Charles Leclerc, and Oscar Piastri, followed a similar strategy of starting on medium tires and then switching to two stints on hard tires. Max Verstappen, who started at a disadvantage with limited tire options, ran an inverted strategy but ultimately had to pit with one lap to go, securing fourth place. The race saw little intervention from the safety car, making it relatively straightforward for the front-runners.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recently passed budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years" and dismissing concerns that it would raise federal deficits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis suggested that the tax provisions in the package could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Republican senators, including fiscal conservatives, have expressed reservations about the bill due to soaring deficit concerns and signaled plans to modify it. Johnson rejected the CBO analysis, asserting that it was "dramatically overstated" and that the bill would stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing U.S. manufacturing.

The actor acknowledges the film's production challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Hollywood strikes, and considers its release a momentous occasion, and he hopes his work will lead to meaningful roles that enhance the human condition, even if he's playing the bad guy.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The move is intended to emphasize Canada's uniqueness and traditions, distinguishing it from being seen as a "51st state," and it comes at a consequential time for Canada, as Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump. The invitation also works to tie Canada closer to Europe, a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, and the visit will be the King's first to Canada as reigning monarch, marking a significant moment between the Head of State and the Canadian people.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses the debate among American conservationists regarding the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the potential for a shift towards directly protecting ecosystems. The ESA has been criticized for its focus on individual species rather than broader ecosystem protection, and the Trump administration's proposed redefinition of harm has sparked renewed discussion. While some advocate for a "native ecosystem‚Äìprotection act" to supplement the ESA, others argue that the current ESA can be wielded more effectively with decisive leadership, with both sides recognizing the importance of preserving American landscapes and biodiversity.</p>
