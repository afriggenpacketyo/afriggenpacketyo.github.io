          <p>China is rapidly advancing its space exploration program, with ambitious goals to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and retrieve samples from Mars. This progress, including developments in its Mengzhou crew capsule and Long March-10 moon rocket, presents a significant challenge to the United States' long-held dominance in space. While NASA's Artemis program officially has an earlier timeline for a crewed lunar landing, it faces substantial technical hurdles, such as the need for in-orbit refueling, which intensifies the new space race between the two nations.</p>

          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has characterized his recent meeting with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio as constructive and a step toward deeper exchanges between the two nations. Wang stated the talks helped manage differences and prevent misjudgments in what both sides acknowledge is the world's most critical bilateral relationship. This diplomatic engagement, which occurred during meetings in Malaysia, comes amid ongoing trade frictions and represents an effort by both powers to manage escalating tensions through dialogue.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles are turning to AI-powered dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler to improve their online dating conversations. These apps analyze chat screenshots and suggest replies, help craft messages to avoid "ghosting," and provide confidence to users who struggle with writing. According to a recent study, nearly half of Gen Z now uses AI to enhance their dating game. While some users find the tools helpful for initiating conversations, experts caution against over-reliance, emphasizing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>A sex therapist and psychotherapist outlines four common but often overlooked factors that can damage intimacy in a relationship. These include the constant distraction of phones, unresolved emotional attachments to an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that leads to self-rejection, and the physiological impact of stress. The article suggests that intimacy is more than physical and that addressing these blockers through open communication and setting boundaries can help couples rebuild a stronger connection and improve overall well-being.</p>

          <h2>Negotiation Expert Explains Why Securing a Raise Requires a Multi-Step Process</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a negotiation expert, successfully securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and often requires a process spanning several weeks. The article advises initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in, rather than at an annual review when budgets are often already set. The initial goal should be to open a dialogue and schedule a follow-up, not to finalize a deal. Patience, clear documentation, and understanding that negotiation is a collaborative, ongoing skill are key to achieving a better compensation package. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after a near-fatal assassination attempt, friends and allies of President Donald Trump observe subtle changes in his demeanor, describing him as more attentive and grateful. While maintaining his characteristic public persona, he openly discusses his belief that he was saved by divine intervention to serve a second term and has decorated the White House with art depicting the event. The attack, which occurred at a campaign rally, remains a constant presence in his life, and those close to him believe the experience has made his public expressions of faith more profound and personal.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has announced that travelers will no longer be required to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints, ending a two-decade-old practice. The policy change is attributed to advancements in screening technology, such as CT scanners that provide 3D images of carry-on items. The article frames this development as a marker of progress, reflecting a significant decline in the threat of large-scale international terrorism compared to the post-9/11 era, though it notes that threats from domestic extremists and budget cuts remain concerns.</p>

It suggests that parental fear of injury often deprives children of developing a robust "movement vocabulary," which is crucial for long-term physical resilience and injury prevention, and encourages parents to allow for more creative and uninhibited play.</p>
