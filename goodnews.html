          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their allies participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, signaling a significant shift in their relationship with the Catholic Church. The event, officially listed on the Vatican's calendar, included a Mass celebrated by a high-ranking Italian bishop who emphasized restoring dignity to marginalized groups. Many pilgrims credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming environment through his inclusive rhetoric and actions, which contrasted with the more rigid stances of his predecessors. This pilgrimage stands in stark contrast to 25 years ago when a similar group was detained as a perceived threat.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend has emerged as a fan favorite at the US Open after a remarkable run in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. Townsend, who reached the fourth round in singles and the final in women's doubles, has long challenged the sport's biases regarding body image, famously being denied funding by the USTA as a top-ranked junior over fitness concerns. Now 29 and a mother, her journey of perseverance, entrepreneurship with her own clothing line, and on-court grace has resonated widely. Her successful tournament has not only brought financial rewards but also earned her newfound respect from top players in the locker room.</p>

          <p>As numerous states implement rules limiting cellphone use in schools, many districts are turning to Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case that secures a student's phone during the school day. The system is now used by at least 2.5 million students across the U.S. to reduce classroom distractions and encourage in-person interaction. While some educators report a positive change in school culture with more student engagement, the policy has met with mixed reactions from students, some of whom are attempting to bypass the system. The cost, ranging from $25-30 per student, has also sparked debate over school budget priorities.</p>

The app uses AI to estimate the calorie count of food from a user's photo, a concept Yadegari developed after finding manual tracking tedious. Having learned to code at age seven and previously sold a gaming website for $100,000, he launched Cal AI in May 2024. Despite its success, Yadegari plans to attend college for only a year before focusing on his business full-time.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying its long-running anti-corruption campaign, extending its focus from the banking industry to the stock market. While the crackdown may not provide an immediate boost to market confidence amid current economic uncertainties, analysts believe it is a crucial step for China's long-term stability. An associate professor at the National University of Singapore suggests that by promoting cleaner governance, the initiative caters to the demands of international institutions and corporations. Over time, this could make the country's financial system more attractive and trustworthy for overseas investors, despite short-term disruptions.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have uncovered the remains of 14 individuals believed to be soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes. The discovery, which includes American, British, and Native American fighters, has launched what experts are calling the "ultimate cold case." A team of forensic genealogists is now using advanced DNA analysis to build genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones. They have already identified thousands of living genetic matches and are asking potential descendants to submit DNA to help finally give these forgotten soldiers their names back.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially begun the process of establishing his presidential library, choosing his home state of Delaware as the location. A 13-person governance board, including former aides like Antony Blinken and chaired by fundraiser Rufus Gifford, has been approved to lead the effort. The team faces the significant challenge of raising hundreds of millions of dollars in a politically polarized climate where traditional corporate donors may be hesitant to contribute. The vision for the library includes a museum detailing his presidency and a center for civic engagement and public service.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's national emergency alert system is scheduled for its second public test this Sunday, September 7, at approximately 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening emergencies like extreme weather or terror attacks by sending a message, a siren-like sound, and vibration to compatible 4G and 5G mobile phones. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that revealed technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed. While officials recommend keeping the alerts enabled, users can opt out through their phone's settings.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a strong Canadian team, resulting in a defeat that likely sets up a challenging quarter-final match against host nation England. Despite a competitive performance that included tries from Rhona Lloyd and Evie Gallagher, the Scots were unable to overcome the world's number two ranked side. Canada secured the top spot in Pool B with their victory. Scotland will now face the winner of the upcoming match between England and Australia, while Canada will likely play the loser of that same contest.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has presented a detailed plan to the company's board aimed at improving performance and reaccelerating growth. The proposal criticizes past strategic missteps, such as keeping its bottling operations in-house and underinvesting in core soda brands. Elliott's plan calls for refranchising the bottling network, divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and reinvesting capital into iconic products like Pepsi and Mountain Dew. The firm argues these changes could unlock significant value and provide at least 50% upside for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a Harvard-trained expert and author, the immense success of figures like Taylor Swift can be attributed to seven key characteristics that foster deep dedication. These traits include imagination, synthesis (connecting old and new ideas), and intense focus on core priorities without dabbling in unimportant ventures. Other crucial attributes are doggedness in the face of difficulty, sustained passion, reverence for one's craft, and an unwavering commitment that requires forgoing other options. The article suggests Swift exemplifies these qualities by consistently prioritizing her songwriting and performing career above all else.</p>

          <p>Bernadette Joy, a financial coach who previously owned four homes, has sold her properties and chosen to rent, a decision she says has made her wealthier and less stressed. Despite being able to buy a house in cash, she argues that renting offers greater flexibility and avoids the significant hidden costs of homeownership, such as renovations, maintenance, and property management. Joy found that being a landlord was often not worth the emotional and financial toll. Instead, she invested the proceeds from her home sales into a portfolio of index funds, which has accelerated her wealth creation.</p>

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré who documented New York's jazz scene in the early 1950s. Model, known for her street photography, aimed to create a book with text by Langston Hughes, but the project was derailed due to FBI investigations into her leftist politics during the McCarthy era. Her images capture not only the audience's rapture but also the wariness and hardship faced by musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, who endured racism despite their fame.
