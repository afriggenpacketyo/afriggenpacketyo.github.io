          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 07:00:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that many institutions are preemptively complying with Donald Trump's policies, which smooths the way to autocracy. It suggests that universities, law firms, and corporations are censoring themselves and altering their behavior to avoid Trump's ire. The author advocates for "anticipatory noncompliance" as a counter-strategy, highlighting examples of institutions pushing back against Trump's demands, such as universities challenging funding threats and states contesting civil rights law interpretations. The article suggests that standing firm against authoritarian demands is essential for restoring democracy, and that popular opposition is emerging in various sectors of society.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details how a network of women in Latin America revolutionized access to safe abortions through the use of misoprostol. Starting in the 1990s, activists shared information about the drug, which could induce abortions, circumventing strict legal restrictions. They established hotlines and published manuals, like the Barbie-themed guide in Argentina, to provide women with crucial information. Activists also developed the "acompa√±amiento" model in Mexico, offering support throughout the abortion process, while Socorristas en Red in Argentina systematized accompaniment and collected data to advocate for legalization. The movement culminated in Argentina legalizing abortion in 2021, inspiring similar changes in Colombia and Mexico, showcasing the power of grassroots activism and accessible information. </p>

This decision follows injuries to Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie, as well as a difficult debut for Cieran Slicker. Head coach Steve Clarke had previously expressed concern over the lack of options in the goalkeeping position, and has now turned to Doohan and McKenna due to the absence of first-choice Craig Gordon and regular squad members Zander Clark and Liam Kelly.</p>
