          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, on Capitol Hill to advocate for the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which had recently passed a House committee. Trump urged lawmakers not to let SALT deductions impede the bill's progress, emphasizing the importance of unity within the party. The meeting was described as positive, with Trump expressing satisfaction with the discussions. Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee, while Trump made an announcement with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at the White House.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch its Tianwen-2 mission at the end of May 2025, marking the country's first attempt to survey and retrieve samples from an asteroid. The mission will target Kamo‚Äôoalewa, a Near-Earth Asteroid, and potentially the comet 311P/PANSTARRS, using techniques previously employed by NASA and JAXA. The entire mission could last a decade, and if successful, it would place China among the leading nations in interplanetary exploration. Tianwen-2 will employ both a "touch-and-go" technique and an "anchor and attach" method to collect samples from the asteroid's surface, which will then be returned to Earth for analysis.</p>

School officials were alerted to the situation in May 2025 and contacted the police, leading to his arrest during a traffic stop. The investigation revealed that Labrador Sierra had been a visa overstay since 2019 and had participated in school sports teams.</p>

A judge has ordered the U.S. to maintain custody of migrants following claims they were being sent to South Sudan, and Governor Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus. Trump unveiled plans for a 'Golden Dome' missile defense system, and Elon Musk announced plans to reduce spending as he steps back from politics. The USDA reversed decades of policy by approving a soda ban for food stamps, and Google introduced a new AI chatbot.

She also defended the candle as 'punk rock,' challenging shame around female sexuality, and expressed her thoughts for those who disagree.

The team's inaugural game against the Los Angeles Sparks sold out, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic crowd, including local celebrities. This marks the first WNBA expansion team since 2008 and the first in the Bay Area, a region with a rich but previously overlooked history in women's basketball. The Valkyries have already surpassed 10,000 season-ticket holders, and their presence is expected to bring a new level of social justice, gender equity, and inclusivity to the Bay Area sports scene.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has been struggling to reduce homelessness, but a committed group of leaders has been collaborating to develop a road map with ambitious and achievable goals. The L.A. County Board of Supervisors endorsed three monitorable top-line goals, including specific targets for 2030. These goals include a 20% reduction in the number of people becoming newly homeless each year, placing 30,000 people into permanent housing, and reducing the number of people living on the streets by nearly a third. These goals provide a platform for institutions to be held accountable by the public and may lead to sustained gains in addressing the homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>Southern California home prices experienced minimal growth in April, with the average home price across the six-county region rising only 0.4% from March to $884,981. This represents a sharp slowdown compared to the previous year, when prices increased by 9%. High mortgage rates, rising inventory levels, and economic uncertainty are contributing factors. Zillow forecasts a slight decline in home prices by April 2026, attributed to an increasing number of homes for sale as existing homeowners move rather than hold onto low pandemic mortgage rates, while first-time buyers face challenges due to limited equity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners. Judges ruled that the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. The decision, likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, follows a legal battle initiated in 2022. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners.</p>
