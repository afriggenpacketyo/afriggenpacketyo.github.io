          <p>With President Trump's ever-changing tariffs causing uncertainty, consumers are seeking ways to save money. Experts advise looking for sales during Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day. Checking the origin of products is crucial, as goods from Canada and Mexico may be subject to tariffs, while those meeting USMCA rules are exempt. Purchasing domestic products and considering the necessity of items, especially electronics and toys, can also help consumers avoid price hikes.
