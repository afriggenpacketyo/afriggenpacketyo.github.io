          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lamine Yamal are set to face off as Portugal plays Spain in the Nations League final. Ronaldo downplayed the idea of a clash between individuals, emphasizing the team aspect of the game. The match marks the first encounter between Barcelona's Yamal, a rising star, and Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner. The media has hyped the event, but both players focus on their respective teams' performance. With both players having scored in their semi-final wins, anticipation is high for the final.</p>

The Dodgers' offense struggled, stranding multiple runners, while the Cardinals broke the tie in the eighth inning.

Yamamoto faced Lars Nootbaar, his former Samurai Japan teammate, striking him out twice, but ultimately, the Dodgers' inability to capitalize on opportunities led to their defeat.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, discusses how flexible working arrangements have allowed her to balance her career and motherhood, which she believes is crucial for teacher retention. Annual data reveals a decline in the overall number of teachers and fewer entering the profession, despite government efforts to recruit new educators. Computer science teacher Sam Alner highlights the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance, leading experienced staff to seek alternative employment. Flexible working options, particularly for new parents, are seen as essential for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrates the potential for treating human blindness with biocompatible nanowire implants. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, acting as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers hope for restoring vision and expanding visual capabilities in humans.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement comes as the REAL ID Act enforcement deadline has passed, requiring travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The TSA emphasized this message in a Facebook post, humorously reminding travelers that their Costco membership cards do not meet the REAL ID requirements. The confusion may stem from the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant documents.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in China. A study by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women, clashing with economic changes.</p>
