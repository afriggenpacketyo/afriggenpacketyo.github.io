          <p>Tommy Robinson, the far-right anti-Islam activist, will be released from prison four months early after his 18-month sentence for contempt of court was reduced. Robinson was jailed for ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee. The High Court granted the sentence reduction after Robinson's lawyers argued that he had demonstrated a 'change in attitude' and a 'commitment' to comply with the court order. This decision comes after a hearing where Robinson's lawyers presented evidence of his altered behavior and willingness to adhere to legal directives.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer Yuri Grigorovich has died at the age of 98. He was the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995 and is credited with redefining Soviet ballet with productions such as 'Ivan the Terrible' and 'Romeo and Juliet'. Grigorovich's work was known for revitalizing male dance, creating demanding roles for men. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to a dancers' strike.</p>

Drawing parallels to her father's Alzheimer's announcement, Davis suggests that Biden can use this opportunity to show leadership on a human level by openly sharing his experiences and feelings about his illness. She argues that such candor could restore trust with voters and transcend partisan politics.</p>
