          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 3.5%. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the strong performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintained a cautious outlook, citing significant global economic uncertainty and potential impacts from U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to downside risks, but this robust GDP data may influence its upcoming decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by strengthening its defense and maritime cooperation with the Philippines while managing its crucial trade relationship with China. As part of a broader civil maritime program, Australia recently donated patrol boats to the Philippine Coast Guard and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million. This strategic partnership enhancement comes as both nations prepare to celebrate 80 years of diplomatic relations, reflecting a shared motivation to bolster regional security amidst rising tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology and engineering-related majors over previously popular subjects like international trade. This trend is heavily influenced by China's state-driven focus on achieving technological self-sufficiency amid intensified competition with the United States. Fields such as information and communications technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices, as they are seen as crucial for the nation's future industrial development. This reflects a strategic funneling of talent into areas deemed vital for national progress.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is celebrating a remarkable scientific milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather recordings. This unbroken, handwritten dataset represents the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, providing invaluable insights into long-term climate change. The tradition, which began on July 14, 1795, has been maintained by a succession of observers, including one woman who heroically continued the work after her husband's death. The records document historic weather events and have contributed to meteorological science, including the development of the cup anemometer.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss a plan for the U.S. to sell weapons to European allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer allied nations like Germany. The meeting comes as the Trump administration signals a potential increase in direct defensive support, including more Patriot missiles, to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. The discussions also coincide with a bipartisan push in Congress for powerful sanctions to cripple Russia's economy.</p>
