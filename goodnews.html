        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising levels of employee burnout, a lifestyle expert suggests practical ways for workers to reduce stress and improve their work-life balance. According to Maisha Wynn, author of "The Wynning Way," employees should structure their day around their energy levels, tackling demanding tasks in the morning and simpler activities later on. She also recommends building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key strategy for avoiding burnout is setting boundaries and learning to say "no" when necessary, prioritizing self-care to maintain overall well-being and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Meme del Real, the versatile keyboardist and vocalist for the iconic Mexican rock band Café Tacvba, is releasing his first solo album, born from a period of introspection and creative surrender. After moving away from Mexico City to the lakeside town of Valle de Bravo, del Real found that the solitude and connection with nature allowed a new collection of songs to emerge organically. The album explores a wide range of sounds, from electronic love songs and futuristic boleros to ambient tracks, all while maintaining a playful and experimental spirit. He describes the process not as an intentional search for inspiration, but as an instinct he couldn't ignore.</p>

          <p>World number one and defending US Open champion Jannik Sinner has advanced to the third round after a decisive straight-sets victory over Australia's Alexei Popyrin. Sinner maintained his dominant form, winning 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 in a clinical performance on Arthur Ashe Stadium that lasted just over two hours. Despite a relatively low first-serve percentage, the Italian player capitalized on strong returning to control the match. The victory extends Sinner's winning streak at hard-court Grand Slams to 23 matches. He is now set to face Canadian player Denis Shapovalov in the next round of the tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dell Technologies' stock fell over 5% in after-hours trading, even after the company reported second-quarter results that beat expectations for both revenue and earnings. The decline was attributed to a third-quarter earnings per share forecast that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Dell's overall revenue was up 19%, largely driven by a 69% surge in its Servers and Networking division, which includes high-demand AI servers. The company raised its full-year revenue outlook and announced plans to double its AI server shipments next fiscal year, but a weaker-than-expected storage business performance contributed to the soft near-term profit guidance.

          <h2>Experts Suggest Ways for Seniors to Address Gaps in Medicare Coverage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:16:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With seniors facing financial pressures from inflation and concerns over Social Security, gaps in Medicare coverage for medical expenses can be a significant burden. This article outlines several financial strategies for older adults to cover out-of-pocket costs like copays and deductibles. Options include purchasing Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to pay for these leftover expenses. Other potential solutions are leveraging home equity through a reverse mortgage, a product available only to homeowners 62 and older, or securing a future income stream by purchasing an annuity to ensure consistent monthly payments.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart. The deal, which could be a club record fee, is seen as a significant move that might influence the future of current striker Alexander Isak, who has been a target for Liverpool. Woltemade is said to be traveling to Tyneside for a medical after a breakout year where he scored 17 goals for Stuttgart and was the top scorer at the Under-21 Euros. The acquisition of a new top-tier striker was one of the conditions Newcastle had set for potentially considering offers for Isak.</p>

          <p>Amazon is integrating fresh groceries into its same-day delivery service for Prime members in select cities, allowing customers to order perishable items alongside other goods for unified delivery. The move leverages Amazon's existing network of same-day fulfillment hubs, which have been retrofitted with temperature-controlled environments to handle fresh food. This expansion aims to make grocery shopping more convenient and directly competes with traditional grocers and delivery services like Instacart. While analysts note that the initial selection of fresh items is limited, the move signals Amazon's long-term ambition to capture a larger share of the U.S. grocery market.
