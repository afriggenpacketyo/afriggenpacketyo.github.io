          <p>PayPal reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance for earnings per share. The positive performance was driven by a 5% increase in sales and a 7% rise in transaction margin dollars, a key profitability metric. Growth was significantly bolstered by its Venmo platform, which saw revenue increase by over 20% and total payment volume grow at its fastest rate in three years. Under CEO Alex Chriss, the company has focused on better monetizing key assets like Venmo and Braintree to drive sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations, with earnings of $1.48 per share. However, the consumer goods giant issued a cautious outlook for fiscal year 2026, warning that new tariffs could create a $1 billion headwind. The company, which owns brands like Tide and Charmin, plans to offset some of these costs through productivity and sourcing changes but will also implement mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products. The guidance reflects a challenging environment where the company must navigate higher costs while catering to value-seeking consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new initiative called "Green Apron Service" as part of a broader strategy to revitalize sales by focusing on customer hospitality. The program, a key component of CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan, trains baristas to provide warmer and more engaging interactions to make store visits a habitual part of a customer's day. This focus on personal connection is supported by investments in technology to ensure proper staffing and faster service times, especially as digital orders now constitute over 30% of sales. The company hopes this return to basics will differentiate it in a competitive market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Union Pacific has made an $85 billion offer to acquire Norfolk Southern, a move that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. The proposed merger would combine Union Pacific's extensive network in the western U.S. with Norfolk Southern's tracks across the east, aiming to streamline national freight deliveries. The deal, which values Norfolk Southern at approximately $320 per share, will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about industry consolidation. If approved, it would likely pressure the remaining major railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue their own merger to remain competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable difference between the United States and Canada is the role religion plays in the public and political spheres, as reflected in the rhetoric of their leaders. While President Donald Trump frequently invokes his faith, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and his predecessors have generally maintained a more secular public persona. This distinction extends to society at large, with Canada having lower church attendance and less political influence from evangelical groups compared to the U.S. The province of Quebec's "Quiet Revolution" in the 1960s, which drastically reduced the Catholic Church's power, exemplifies Canada's trend toward secularism.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old man, is recovering after a successful double-lung transplant, a procedure he underwent after a terminal lung disease was discovered by chance during a routine X-ray. Kennedy was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive condition with no known cure, and was given less than a year to live. Despite initial reservations, he was approved for the transplant at Cleveland Clinic and received new lungs after a month-long hospital stay. Now, with his lung capacity restored to 98%, he is resuming his life and plans to train a new therapy dog named Encore to celebrate his second chance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread warnings, the full impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices has not yet materialized due to several strategic factors. The administration has repeatedly delayed the implementation of the highest tariffs, giving importers a window to act. In anticipation, many companies stockpiled goods, rushing shipments from overseas to build up inventory before the new import taxes took effect. Additionally, some importers are holding back shipments or absorbing the initial cost increases to avoid alienating inflation-weary shoppers. However, experts warn that these are temporary measures, and price hikes are still expected as stockpiles dwindle and storage costs rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing has shown signs of a turnaround, reporting significantly reduced quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue, driven by its highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. The aerospace giant lost $176 million in the second quarter, a marked improvement from the $1.09 billion loss a year earlier. CEO Kelly Ortberg credited the progress to better performance across the business, including more stable production of the 737 Max. While challenges remain, such as delays in certifying new Max variants, the results suggest the company is making headway in recovering from years of crises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to long-held pessimistic views, the institution of marriage in the United States is showing signs of a comeback, according to a new analysis. The divorce rate has fallen by nearly 40% since its peak in the early 1980s, and the share of children living in stable, two-parent married families has started to increase for the first time in decades. This trend is observed even among working-class and Black Americans. The article suggests this resilience is due to marriage adapting to modern expectations, such as more equitable sharing of household and childcare duties, challenging negative narratives from both the left and right.</p>

Swinney advocated for an exemption for the spirit, a critical Scottish export, highlighting its unique geographical origin. He also urged the president to use his influence to push for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza.

          <p>The de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jetliner, marked the dawn of the jet age in 1952 but its reign was cut short by a series of catastrophic failures. Offering unprecedented speed and comfort, the Comet was a symbol of luxury travel before design flaws in its fuselage led to fatal mid-air breakups. A museum in the UK has now painstakingly restored the fuselage of one of these pioneering aircraft, offering a unique glimpse into early jet travel. The restoration honors the Comet's legacy as an innovation that, through its tragic mistakes, ultimately paved the way for safer modern aviation.</p>

However, these protections will not apply when a device is connected to a separate Wi-Fi network. The initiative is part of a broader push by tech companies to enhance online safety for minors, though experts note that implementation can be complex and that determined users may find ways to bypass such restrictions.</p>
