          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge issued an emergency order halting the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for takeoff, forcing officials to deplane the minors and return them to government custody. Attorneys for the children argued the deportations would be illegal, depriving them of due process and the right to seek humanitarian protection. The government contended it was repatriating the children at their families' request, a claim disputed by advocates.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asserted that while Germany hopes for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, it cannot come at the cost of Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. In an interview, Merz stated that surrendering to Russia is not a viable option, as it would endanger other nations, including Germany itself. He reaffirmed that supporting Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression remains an "absolute priority" for his government. Germany is a significant military backer of Ukraine, having provided or pledged substantial aid since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 at Anfield thanks to a late free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in a closely watched early Premier League season contest. The article suggests that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative tactical approach may have cost his team a chance to make a statement against the reigning champions. Despite significant summer spending, Arsenal struggled to create scoring opportunities against a resilient Liverpool defense. The result extends Arsenal's long winless streak at Anfield and gives Liverpool an early psychological advantage in the title race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center has reported the formation of Tropical Storm Kiko in the eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 miles off the coast of Mexico.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Formula 1 driver Lando Norris described his retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix as a significant blow to his world championship hopes, as it widened the points gap with his victorious McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri. An oil leak forced Norris out of the race with only seven laps remaining, leaving him 34 points behind Piastri. Despite the setback, Norris stated he would "go for it" in the remaining nine races of the season. The event highlighted the close competition between the two McLaren drivers and the team's overall superiority this season.</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 defeat to Brighton, Manchester City has recorded its worst start to a Premier League season in over two decades, raising questions about their status as title contenders. Despite significant spending and the return of key players like Rodri, the team has shown inconsistency reminiscent of last season's trophyless campaign. The article notes that no team in the 38-game era has recovered from such a poor start to win the league. Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged the team's struggles after conceding the lead, emphasizing the long season ahead.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced on social media that he recently underwent surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, from his face. He shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks and used the opportunity to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Ramsay, known for hosting "Hell's Kitchen," has previously shared health updates to promote safety, such as advocating for helmet use after a bicycle accident. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and has a very high cure rate when detected and treated early.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, achieved his second recorded hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The impressive shot occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass from 177 yards out. His first ace was accomplished last December at the PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. This latest feat highlights the young golfer's developing talent as he follows in the footsteps of his famous father, who has 10 recorded holes-in-one in his career.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This agreement strengthens the NATO northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates. The partnership represents a significant strategic and industrial victory for the UK over competing bids from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all the winning numbers in Saturday night's drawing.

The next drawing will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won on May 31.

          <p>At an informal meeting, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine, including the possibility of secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners. Another novel proposal involves inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production on EU soil, creating a "safe haven" for its defense industry. Discussions also revisited the controversial idea of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv, a move some member states fear could be illegal and destabilize markets. These talks reflect the EU's ongoing effort to find more impactful and sustainable methods of assisting Ukraine amid the protracted conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, described in this analysis as one of the worst in recent memory. The article notes that while Rangers showed fight and organization, a positive for their beleaguered manager, their attack was ineffective. Celtic's performance was particularly criticized as "powder-puff," with the team failing to create any significant scoring chances and looking creatively barren. The result leaves both clubs with significant questions to address, particularly Celtic, whose attacking inability was starkly exposed in the goalless stalemate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. The Bay Foundation led an effort over 13 years, employing divers to smash nearly 6 million voracious purple sea urchins that had decimated the kelp. This allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to regrow across 80 acres, restoring critical habitat for over 800 species and improving water quality. The project's success, turning barren sea floors back into thriving underwater forests, serves as a potential model for other coastal regions where kelp is struggling.</p>
