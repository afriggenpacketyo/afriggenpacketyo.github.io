        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large and bright meteor, known as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina on Thursday afternoon. According to NASA, the space rock, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It ultimately exploded 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, creating a pressure wave that produced audible booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the event, which experts suggest may have been part of the rarely seen Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city vulnerable to the "Urban Heat Island" effect, a local environmental group is pioneering solutions on a single "cool block." The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with heat-reflecting light colors, and painting rooftops white to combat dangerously high temperatures. This urban laboratory approach is a response to research showing dense urban areas can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener ones, a problem worsening with climate change. The initiative provides a potential template for other cities looking to create more livable urban environments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that the 90-day pause on its reciprocal tariff scheme, set to expire on July 9, could be extended. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt stated that the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is a decision for the president to make. This development comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryohei Akazawa, is in Washington for another round of talks aimed at securing concessions on the proposed duties. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs for about 60 trading partners, with Japan facing a potential additional tariff of 14 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

As the chair of the task force that wrote the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders, his work contributed to broadening the criteria for autism. Dr. Frances explains that this expansion, while intended to identify more severe cases earlier, inadvertently led to the diagnosis of many milder cases that might not have been classified as such before.
