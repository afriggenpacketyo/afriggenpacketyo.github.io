        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film 'Steve' features Cillian Murphy in a compelling role as the head teacher of a reform school for troubled teenage boys. The movie, adapted from Max Porter's novella 'Shy,' focuses on the intense and compassionate educator's efforts to connect with his volatile students over a single chaotic day. While the article praises Murphy's immersive performance and the film's raw energy, it critiques the overall narrative as being somewhat scattered and reliant on stylistic flourishes. However, it highlights the powerful moments when the film zeroes in on its characters' vulnerability and the challenges they face.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and China to resolve the TikTok ownership dispute could center on a licensing agreement for the app's highly valued recommendation algorithm. This approach would allow a new U.S. entity to use the technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, potentially satisfying both U.S. national security concerns and China's prohibition on exporting the algorithm itself. Experts suggest this would be more like renting the technology than an outright sale. The arrangement aims to prevent a U.S. ban while addressing fears that the Chinese government could access American user data.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a comprehensive package of climate and energy bills designed as a compromise to advance clean energy while stabilizing fuel costs. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, directing billions toward lowering utility bills and funding public transit. Controversially, one bill allows for thousands of new oil wells in Kern County and gives the governor power to suspend summer-blend gasoline standards if prices spike. The package also establishes groundwork for a Western states electricity market to more efficiently share renewable energy resources.</p>

          <p>The Canadian women's rugby team delivered a stunning performance, defeating the six-time and defending world champion New Zealand Black Ferns in the World Cup semi-final. Canada's victory ended New Zealand's 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament, a seismic upset in the sport. The Canadian team, which had to fundraise to support its journey to the tournament, dominated the match to secure a spot in the final. The result is being hailed as a 'fairytale' and a monumental moment for Canadian rugby, setting them up to face either England or France for the championship title.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed former U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force has the specific responsibility for policing borders, though it maintains a working relationship with the navy. The comments came as nearly 1,000 migrants were believed to have crossed the Channel on Friday. Trump had remarked during his state visit that military intervention was a necessary tool to deal with illegal migration, a method his administration employed at the southern U.S. border.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Dismisses Trump's Lawsuit Against The New York Times for Excessive Length</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed former President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the 85-page complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge ruled that the filing violated federal rules requiring allegations to be simple and concise, criticizing its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail." The dismissal is without prejudice, meaning Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended complaint that adheres to a 40-page limit. The lawsuit targets the newspaper and four of its reporters over their extensive coverage of his career and presidency.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Megadoc' Offers Insightful but Timid Look at the Making of Coppola's 'Megalopolis'</h2>

          <p>A new documentary, 'Megadoc,' chronicles the tumultuous production of Francis Ford Coppola's self-financed epic, 'Megalopolis.' Directed by Mike Figgis, the film provides a useful behind-the-scenes look at the ambitious project, capturing moments of creative conflict and resolution. The review notes that while insightful, the documentary is too respectful of Coppola to delve deeply into the production's biggest disasters, unlike the famed 'Hearts of Darkness' which documented 'Apocalypse Now.' It captures on-set drama, including the firing of a VFX supervisor, but avoids more serious allegations and the film's ultimate struggle to find a major distributor.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal on TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, but a final agreement has not yet been reached. Trump expressed optimism, stating a deal is "well on its way," while Chinese state media provided a more reserved account of the conversation. The discussions are aimed at resolving U.S. national security concerns over the popular video app's Chinese ownership. The potential framework involves U.S. investors gaining control of a new entity that would license TikTok's algorithm from its parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new policy to establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would make police more accessible, making it easier for citizens to report crimes and share information, thereby improving public confidence. The plan, announced at the party's annual conference, would be funded by scrapping the elected Police and Crime Commissioner positions. The proposal aims to counteract the decline in traditional police station front counters and what the party calls a lack of meaningful action on community policing.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, which would value the company at $200 billion. This fundraising effort reflects the soaring valuations in the AI sector, following similar large rounds for competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Musk later denied the report on his social media platform X, stating the company is not currently raising capital. The funds would likely be used to acquire massive computing resources and talent needed to develop next-generation AI models, as the company is building a large AI supercomputer in Memphis.</p>
