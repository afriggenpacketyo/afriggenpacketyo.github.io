          <h2>Chinese Scientists Announce More Efficient Data Sorting System for AI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 05:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have engineered a new method for sorting data that is significantly faster and more energy-efficient, potentially resolving a major bottleneck in artificial intelligence and scientific computing. The system utilizes memristors, a type of electronic component with memory capabilities, to perform sorting operations directly within the memory hardware. This approach is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Von Neumann architecture, where data must constantly move between storage and processing units. A hardware prototype has already demonstrated notable performance improvements in tasks like route finding and neural network inference, marking a key step forward in advanced data processing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop star Miley Cyrus has revealed that she used a specialized therapy to overcome a long-standing battle with severe stage fright. In recent interviews, she credited Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy with completely eliminating her performance anxiety, calling the treatment life-saving. EMDR is a psychotherapeutic method designed to help individuals process trauma by using bilateral stimulation, such as eye movements or tapping, to shift distressing memories from the emotional to the logical part of the brain. Mental health experts note that by addressing the root cause of anxiety, the therapy can replace negative beliefs with empowering ones, a process Cyrus's experience publicly validates.</p>

          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a genetic form of hearing loss in a clinical trial. The study, detailed in Nature Medicine, involved ten participants with deafness caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Researchers used a harmless virus to deliver a healthy copy of the gene into the inner ear, resulting in significant hearing improvement for all participants within a month. One seven-year-old girl regained nearly all her hearing, highlighting the therapy's life-changing potential and paving the way for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>Thousands of followers, including actor Richard Gere, gathered in Dharamshala, India, to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader. The festivities marked the culmination of a week of prayers, during which the Dalai Lama reassured followers of his good health and confirmed plans for a successor, ending speculation that the 600-year-old institution might end with him. He has stated his reincarnation will occur in the "free world," outside of Chinese control. This has intensified political tensions, as Beijing insists it has the sole authority to approve the next Dalai Lama, a move Tibetans fear is aimed at tightening control over Tibet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's criticality, which is the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is widely believed to be essential for optimizing the brain's information processing capabilities. The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that genetics influence this critical state across various scales, from individual brain regions to large networks. The findings also establish a connection between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation and opening new avenues for understanding brain function and disorders.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry is celebrating an emotional run to the fourth round of Wimbledon after enduring a difficult year marked by significant health issues. The 29-year-old has been battling vestibular neuritis, a condition causing severe vertigo and vision problems, which first appeared just over a year ago when he was ranked in the world's top 20. His struggles caused his ranking to plummet, but he now feels he is returning to form at his favorite tournament. Jarry, who will face Britain's Cameron Norrie next, is matching the best Wimbledon performance of his grandfather, Jaime Fillol, who reached the same stage in 1974.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to export six used Abukuma-class navy destroyers to the Philippines in a move to bolster Manila's maritime deterrence capabilities against China's expansionism. The agreement was reportedly reached between the two nations' defense ministers last month, with the Philippine military set to inspect the vessels this summer. This marks a significant step in the growing military cooperation between the two U.S. allies, who both face challenges from Beijing's assertive actions in the region. To comply with Japan's pacifist constitution, the transfer will be structured as a joint development project to cover the installation of equipment requested by the Philippines.</p>

Musk positioned the party as a challenge to the two-party system, stating it was formed to "give you back your freedom." It remains unclear if the party has been formally registered with election authorities or who will lead it, as the South Africa-born Musk is ineligible to run for the US presidency himself.</p>

These centers are designed to provide a wide range of services for families, from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, aiming to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. The initiative builds on the New Labour-era "Sure Start" centers, many of which were closed due to funding cuts after 2010. The Conservative opposition has questioned the plan, suggesting it may simply rebrand existing services.</p>
