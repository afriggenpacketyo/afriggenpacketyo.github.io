          <p>The Trump administration has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the U.S. government its largest single shareholder. This move, converting grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, is a rare instance of direct government investment in a private company outside of a crisis. The primary motivation is to reduce reliance on foreign chip manufacturing, particularly from Taiwan, amid geopolitical tensions with China and the race for AI dominance. While the deal aims to secure national security and supply chains, experts note it carries risks, including potential political pressure on Intel's business decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that the cooperative political intent shown by Asian powers within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) needs to be supported by new global economic and monetary institutions. The author draws a parallel to the post-war Bretton Woods agreement, arguing that without such a framework, the world risks further fragmentation into competing blocs. The article highlights the growing influence of the SCO, which now includes 27 members, observer states, and dialogue partners. It posits that this collective could play a significant role in establishing a more stable and integrated international order.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has marked his official entry into adulthood with a traditional coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status underscores the ongoing debate in Japan about its male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the future of the world's oldest continuous monarchy is uncertain. This event has reignited discussions about potentially allowing female succession, a change supported by much of the public but opposed by conservatives.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their journey of becoming a Buffalo Bills fan, an experience that transformed their view of sports and provided a deeper understanding of community and identity. The essay explores how the team embodies the spirit of Buffalo, a city often depicted as hard on its luck but possessing a resilient, underdog mentality. The author reflects on the powerful bond forged among fans through shared hope and repeated heartbreak, such as the team's four consecutive Super Bowl losses in the 1990s. Ultimately, supporting the Bills becomes a way to connect with a place and its people, even from afar.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package involves awarding him up to 12% of the company's stock over a decade, contingent on meeting aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The move is seen as an incentive to retain Musk and ensure his focus on turning Tesla into an AI and robotics leader. However, the proposal has raised concerns among some analysts about corporate governance and whether such an immense package is justified. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the termination of legal status for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians, allowing them to continue living and working in the United States. The judge criticized the Homeland Security Secretary's decision as "arbitrary and capricious," stating it would force individuals back to dangerously unstable home countries. This decision provides a reprieve for many who faced deportation and family separation after a previous Supreme Court action allowed the terminations to proceed temporarily.</p>

          <p>A fierce "talent war" has erupted in the artificial intelligence sector, with major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft offering massive compensation packages to attract a small pool of top AI researchers and engineers. The high demand and limited supply of specialists who can build and train large language models have driven salaries and signing bonuses into the millions. This spending is considered a relatively small investment by companies pouring billions into developing foundational AI models. The intense competition risks leaving startups and traditional industries behind, as they cannot compete with the salaries offered by Big Tech. (not investment advice)</p>
