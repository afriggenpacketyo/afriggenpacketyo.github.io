          <h2>New Senate Bill Proposes Eliminating All Federal Taxes on Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 15:06:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego has introduced the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," a bill aimed at permanently eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for all recipients. The proposal contrasts with the recently passed Republican tax law, which offers a temporary, income-based deduction for seniors. To offset the cost, Gallego's bill would increase Social Security's revenue by applying the payroll tax to annual earnings over $250,000, a significant increase from the current cap. Proponents argue this change would provide crucial financial relief to seniors, while analysis suggests it would also extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund by 24 years, ensuring full benefits could be paid until 2058.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed certain country-based tariffs could lead to tens of billions of dollars in refunds for American businesses. The court found that Trump lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement the sweeping levies. While the administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, if the ruling stands, the government may have to return over $70 billion collected from these specific tariffs. The situation creates significant uncertainty for businesses, and experts suggest that even if refunds are owed, the process for claiming them could be complex, potentially requiring companies to file individual requests rather than receiving automatic reimbursements.</p>

Taylor, who also serves as the chairman of OpenAI's board, launched Sierra in 2023.

The number of 401(k) accounts with balances of $1 million or more surged to 595,000, while IRA millionaires reached a new high of 501,481. This growth was driven by a rebound in the stock market during the second quarter and consistent savings behaviors among account holders. The average 401(k) balance increased by 8% year-over-year to a record $137,800. Experts attribute the positive outcomes to savers who continued to contribute steadily, even during periods of market volatility, allowing them to benefit from the subsequent market recovery.

          <p>The opening game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs features a unique family connection, as Chargers' head strength coach Devin Woodhouse is the son-in-law of Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid. This adds a personal dynamic to the rivalry between the two AFC West teams. Reid expressed his support for Woodhouse, noting he was honored when new Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh called him to ask if it was okay to hire his son-in-law. Woodhouse, who is married to Reid's daughter Drew Ann, plays a crucial role in the Chargers' player performance program, focusing on both the physical and mental capabilities of the athletes ahead of the highly anticipated matchup.</p>

          <h2>Ford's Gas-Powered Expedition SUV Sees Surge in Sales Amid EV Market Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 14:42:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a broader industry push towards electric vehicles, Ford is experiencing a significant sales boom with its large, gas-powered Expedition SUV. The automaker reported a 53.7% year-over-year increase in Expedition sales for August, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This success with a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle indicates strong continuing consumer demand for larger family SUVs, even as Ford's own EV sales also see growth. Ford executives have noted they are strategically focusing on hybrid models in addition to all-electric ones, positioning themselves differently from competitors who have more fully committed to an all-EV lineup, a strategy that appears to be paying off with customers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 14:39:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are dealing with a pervasive "rotten egg" smell caused by large quantities of an invasive Japanese seaweed called Heterosiphonia japonica. The seaweed was washed ashore by the strong winds and high tides from the recent Hurricane Erin. According to city officials, the powerful odor is a natural result of the seaweed decomposing in the Good Harbor estuary after being trapped by the tides. While the smell is unpleasant, authorities have assured the public that it is not dangerous and will gradually dissipate as the seaweed breaks down. The red seaweed is known for spreading aggressively and has been linked to fish die-offs in other areas.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that his government is exploring the implementation of a digital ID system as a measure to tackle illegal working and immigration. Starmer suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the UK, noting that public perception of digital identity has evolved since the controversial physical ID card debates of the 2000s. The proposal involves creating a more consistent and secure method for employers to verify a person's right to work, potentially reducing the use of fraudulent documents. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch expressed skepticism, stating it would not solve the core problems of illegal migration.</p>
