          <p>In Arizona, Stacey Wales used artificial intelligence to create a likeness of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, who was killed in a 2021 road rage incident, for his victim impact statement during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The AI-generated avatar delivered a message of forgiveness, which Judge Todd Lang praised. While innovative, the use of AI in legal proceedings raises concerns about manipulation and deception. Defense lawyer Jason D. Lamm suggested that the court's reliance on the AI video could be grounds for appeal, while Brooklyn Law School professor Cynthia Godsoe voiced concern over the potential for emotional manipulation and alteration of evidence using AI. The NY Times article states that a New York appellate court rejected a lawyer's attempt to use an AI avatar to present an argument.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new trade pact with the UK, while hailed as a "breakthrough", is being analyzed for its actual benefits to America. The agreement retains the 10% import tax on most UK goods, while the US agreed to reduce import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the White House said it had won changes that would expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol and other agricultural products in the UK. Some analysts believe the changes are marginal and the benefits are limited, while others highlight the political victory it provides for Trump. American carmakers are expressing concerns that the plans made UK-cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are calling for a revision of World War II history, challenging the "Western-centric" view by proposing that the conflict's start date be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria. This perspective aims to highlight China's role as a frontline against fascism. The current historical narrative, which marks 1939 as the beginning, diminishes China's contributions to the war. Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, Britain can export 100,000 cars per year to the U.S. with a 10 percent tariff, and the U.S. will remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. While many details are still being worked out, this deal may provide hints for other countries negotiating with the Trump administration. The agreement leaves in place a 10 percent baseline tariff that Trump imposed in April on almost all countries, with only the country-specific part of his so-called reciprocal tariffs being negotiable.</p>

Perry uses these varied formats to capture the band's essence and challenge conventional storytelling methods. The behind-the-scenes clips of the Pavement musical are the most delightful in the movie, just for the counterintuitive thrill of watching theater kids sing and dance through a catalog that would seem to defy their essential earnestness.</p>

However, early trends in the second quarter show comparable sales increasing by 5%, exceeding consensus estimates, but the increased full year commodity cost inflation outlook shouldn't be ignored either.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an AI tool, FaceAge, that estimates a person's biological age by analyzing facial photos, potentially guiding medical care. A study found that cancer patients with younger FaceAge estimates fared better after treatment. The tool could become a quick and inexpensive way to assess patient health compared to existing tests. Ethical concerns exist regarding potential misuse, bias, and the impact of cosmetic modifications on accuracy.</p>
