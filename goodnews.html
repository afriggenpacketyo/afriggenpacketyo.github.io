        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the nearly two-decade-long requirement for airline passengers to remove their shoes during airport security screenings. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the change aims to streamline the screening process and make travel more enjoyable for the public while maintaining safety. The mandate was first implemented by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as a security measure following an attempted shoe bombing in 2001. This policy shift marks a significant change in airport security procedures across the United States.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the famed U.S. warship USS New Orleans, which was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the World War II Battle of Tassafaronga in 1942. The bow was found resting 675 meters deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. Despite the catastrophic damage that killed over 180 crew members, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, sailing it to Australia for repairs. This discovery, made possible by international scientific collaboration, offers a poignant reminder of the crew's valor and the intense naval battles of the Pacific war.</p>

          <p>Mandonna Kashanian, an Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years without legal status, has been released from ICE detention following a significant community and political effort. Kashanian, 64, was abruptly detained in front of her New Orleans home, but a letter-writing campaign highlighting her community service reached top officials, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Although she had previously been denied asylum and permanent residency, she had been allowed to stay under judicial supervision for decades. Her detention came amid a nationwide crackdown and heightened tensions with Iran.</p>

          <h2>Savers Advised on Strategic CD Moves Ahead of July Federal Reserve Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:31:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, financial experts suggest that savers should act strategically to capitalize on currently high Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. Potential interest rate cuts could lower returns, making it crucial to lock in favorable rates now. Savers are advised to carefully calculate their deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties, shop at online banks which often offer higher rates, and secure a high-rate CD as soon as possible. This proactive approach can help protect savings and maximize interest earnings in a potentially changing economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>LA Times Review Describes New 'Superman' as Energetic but Lacking Sincerity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:24:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this review, the new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, reboots the hero with an energetic and pop-punk sensibility but struggles with earnestness. The film portrays Superman, played by David Corenswet, as somewhat obtuse and overwhelmed, a departure from traditional depictions. While the plot is entertaining and filled with quirky side characters and villains, the movie's tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting. The reviewer suggests that while Gunn confidently injects his signature weirdness, the film falters when it attempts to be sincere, making the Man of Steel feel more like a Man of Marshmallow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review praises the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie for its consciously sincere and lighthearted tone, which sets it apart from previous, grimmer adaptations. The film presents Superman not as a lone god but as one of many heroes, a choice that helps define his unique, altruistic character. The reviewer finds the film's whimsical energy, reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons, to be a brilliant and refreshing shift for the superhero genre. By embracing sincerity and silliness, the movie successfully makes a case for the enduring appeal of a hero who stands for unambiguous good.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation, reintroduced by the new Labour government, is designed to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and putting fans' interests at the heart of the game. The move was celebrated by campaign groups as a historic step toward a fairer future for football. However, an amendment to make more Premier League games available on free-to-air television was voted down.</p>
