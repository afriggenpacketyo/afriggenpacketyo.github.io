          <p>Oil prices fell after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no casualties, easing fears of escalating Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil prices decreased by 2.85% to $66.57 per barrel, and Brent crude fell by 2.77% to $69.50. Investors' optimism that the conflict would de-escalate grew after President Trump acknowledged early notice of the strike, preventing loss of life, and called for peace, suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy may be in play, according to analysts. The market's reaction indicates a belief that tensions will subside following the initial U.S. response. Optimism is further fueled by Trump's call for peace.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, but Iranian officials offered less definitive statements. Trump's timeline outlined specific hours for both sides to cease strikes, while Iran indicated a halt to strikes conditional on Israel's actions. The conflict, initiated by Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, led to retaliatory attacks and U.S. military intervention. Qatar played a key role in brokering the deal, with Trump directly communicating with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and other officials engaging with Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire agreement. The agreement could potentially de-escalate tensions and prevent a wider regional conflict. Iran indicated a halt to attacks contingent on Israel ceasing aggression, marking a possible turning point after retaliatory strikes. The situation developed after U.S. airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting concerns about further escalation.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers lauded President Trump's negotiating skills and leadership. Democrats, however, appeared to withhold their congratulations, with some raising concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the U.S. military involvement. Republicans emphasized Trump's ability to achieve peace through strength, while Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the president's unilateral decision to engage in military action without congressional approval. The ceasefire announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment sites.</p>

The charity states that almost half of young people referred to mental health services also have speech and language challenges. They advocate for better training for teachers and mental health professionals to identify language issues early and for schools and mental health teams to move away from reliance on talking-based therapies. The government says it will ensure more children receive the help they need to overcome communication challenges.</p>
