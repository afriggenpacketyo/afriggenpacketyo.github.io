          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 07:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volkswagen has confirmed it will shut down its joint venture factory with local partner SAIC in Nanjing, China, in the coming months. The closure is part of the German automaker's strategic pivot towards producing electric, intelligent, and connected vehicles. A company spokesperson stated that many of its Chinese sites are being converted for EV production, and the Nanjing plant's urban location made such an expansion difficult. The factory, which opened in 2008 and had a capacity of 360,000 vehicles per year, produced models like the Volkswagen Passat.</p>

          <h2>Author Argues High Beauty Costs Act as a Financial Hurdle for Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin identifies the significant, often-overlooked financial burden of beauty expenses on women, which she terms the "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on aesthetic enhancements like hair, nails, and skincare creates a cycle of recurring costs that function as a depreciating asset, unlike traditional investments. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these expenses to understand their true cost and then experimenting with cutting back. The saved money can then be redirected toward building wealth through debt repayment or investing.</p>

          <h2>Woman Seeks Advice After Refusing to Cook Separate Breakfasts for Sister's Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 07:00:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A woman turned to Reddit's "Am I the a--hole" forum after a conflict with her sister, who recently moved in with her two young children following a breakup. The poster explained that her sister sleeps until the afternoon, leaving her to provide breakfast for the kids, who became increasingly demanding about their meals. After several days of cooking separate dishes, the woman told her niece and nephew she would no longer act as a short-order cook and that they should ask their mother. This led to a confrontation where the sister accused her of neglect, prompting the poster to tell her sister to wake up and care for her own children.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch its Tianzhou-9 cargo spacecraft to deliver supplies to the Tiangong space station. The spacecraft and its Long March-7 Y10 carrier rocket have been moved to the launch pad at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, with pre-launch checks now underway. The mission will transport essential supplies for the astronauts currently aboard the station, including food, equipment, and experiments. Notably, the cargo includes two sets of new, domestically developed spacesuits designed for an extended lifespan of 20 spacewalks over four years, marking an upgrade from previous models.</p>

          <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has praised the beginning of a disarmament process by the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), signaling a potential end to the four-decade conflict. His comments followed a symbolic event where PKK members in northern Iraq destroyed their weapons, a first step in a peace process urged by their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan. The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, and the PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S., and the EU. Erdogan hailed the development as opening the door to a "strong Turkey," though officials have not detailed any concessions made to the PKK.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that while many college students believe finance offers the best career prospects, employment data suggests otherwise. According to the New York Fed, majors like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates than finance or computer science. This trend is causing some to reconsider the value of different degrees, with demand for humanities majors reportedly on the rise. At a recent conference, a BlackRock executive noted the firm is actively seeking graduates with degrees in history and English, highlighting the growing importance of creative thinking and soft skills in the modern economy.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film has faced criticism from some conservative commentators for being "superwoke" due to director James Gunn's acknowledgment of the character's immigrant story. However, the article argues this backlash is unfounded, as Superman has always been an immigrant from the planet Krypton. The film itself reportedly emphasizes all-American values, with Clark Kent's heroism rooted in his upbringing in Kansas, representing a story of assimilation and opportunity. The commentary suggests the debate ignores the character's long history and that his story has never been radical, especially compared to other comics that more directly tackle social justice themes.</p>
