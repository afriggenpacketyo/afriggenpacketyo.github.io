          <p>OpenAI's ChatGPT is projected to reach 700 million weekly active users, a fourfold increase from last year, with daily user messages exceeding 3 billion across its various AI products. The company also reported a rise to 5 million paying business users and $13 billion in annual recurring revenue, on track for $20 billion by year-end. This rapid expansion follows a recently secured $8.3 billion investment as part of a SoftBank-led $40 billion fundraising round, underscoring strong investor confidence in the competitive AI market.

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new $29 billion stock-based pay package for CEO Elon Musk, consisting of 96 million restricted shares. This decision comes six months after a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 $56 billion compensation, which Musk is currently appealing. The company aims to retain Musk's leadership through what it views as an "inflection point" as Tesla transitions into an AI-first entity, amidst intensifying competition for AI talent. The new award is designed to incentivize Musk to remain at the company, removing a perceived overhang on the stock.</p>

          <p>The European Union announced a six-month suspension of its planned countermeasures against U.S. tariffs, which were set to begin this week. This delay stems from an agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump on July 27, aimed at restoring stability in transatlantic trade. The EU seeks to finalize a joint statement with the U.S. and will formally implement the pause on countermeasures, allowing for continued negotiations. The move represents a concession from the EU following weeks of discussions, despite lingering questions about the enforceability of certain aspects of the broader trade deal.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent uptick in inflation, experts anticipate Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates will largely remain stable through August and into the fall. The Federal Reserve held its federal funds rate steady for the fifth consecutive time in July, influencing the consistency in CD rates. While some banks have slightly lowered rates in anticipation of future rate cuts, the overall expectation is for minimal change. Savers are advised to consider shorter-term CDs or high-yield savings accounts due to current market uncertainty and the potential for future rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade of intensive research, scientists have identified Vibrio pectenicida as the primary bacterial culprit behind the devastating sea star wasting disease. This mysterious illness, which caused sea stars to disintegrate and wiped out millions along the West Coast since 2013, significantly impacted marine ecosystems, leading to the collapse of kelp forests. Researchers painstakingly isolated the bacterium from infected sea stars and successfully demonstrated its ability to transmit the disease. This breakthrough provides crucial insight, offering a roadmap for developing better strategies to protect and recover vulnerable sea star populations, including the critically affected sunflower sea star.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly exploring the sale of striker Darwin Nunez to Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal, which is controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). This potential move could financially aid Liverpool's efforts to acquire Alexander Isak from Newcastle, another club with PIF ownership. Newcastle recently rejected a £110m bid for Isak, valuing him at £150m, raising questions among fans about PIF's priorities between its various club investments. Football finance experts suggest Liverpool can afford Isak independently, downplaying direct 'scratch my back' scenarios, as Newcastle remains unwilling to sell their key player.</p>

          <p>The fifth Test between England and India culminated in a sensational and intensely dramatic finale at The Oval, with India securing a six-run victory. The match, part of a gripping Test series, saw England's valiant chase of 374 runs fall just short, despite the heroic efforts of a one-armed Chris Woakes. The atmosphere was electric, with a sold-out crowd witnessing a contest reminiscent of the 2005 Ashes classic. The series ended level at 2-2, a fair result reflecting the competitive nature of the teams and the thrilling 'Bazball' era of English cricket.</p>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has issued a public appeal for donations of unwanted small pets, such as chickens, rabbits, and guinea pigs, and even horses, to feed its captive predators. The zoo states that providing 'whole prey' is crucial for the natural behavior, nutrition, and well-being of its animals, mimicking their wild diet. Donated animals are humanely euthanized by trained staff, ensuring nothing goes to waste while supporting the food chain. The initiative highlights zoos' responsibility to imitate natural feeding practices, with donors potentially receiving a tax deduction for horses.</p>

          <p>Millions of car buyers in the UK who used car finance in the last 18 years could be eligible for compensation due to hidden commissions paid to dealers. A recent Supreme Court ruling clarified that while many commission payments were legal, failure to disclose details could be unfair and unlawful. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is establishing a compensation scheme, with first payments expected in 2026. Consumers are advised against using claims companies, as they won't expedite the process and will charge fees.

          <p>Lending experts suggest that a favorable home equity loan rate in August 2025 would likely range between 7% and 10%, with anything below 8.25% for a 10-year term or 8.20% for a 15-year term considered good. Key factors influencing rates include credit score (740+ for lower rates), loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (lower LTV for better rates), debt-to-income (DTI) ratio (below 43% preferred), and loan term (shorter terms often have lower rates). Borrowers are advised to shop around, improve credit scores, borrow only what's needed, and consider total costs beyond just the rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and Technology Group, against NBCUniversal. The lawsuit stemmed from comments made by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC in March 2021, regarding a package Nunes received from a suspected Russian agent and his alleged failure to hand it over to the FBI. Judge Kevin Castel ruled that Nunes failed to prove Maddow acted with actual malice, finding no clear evidence she knew her statements were false or showed reckless disregard for the truth. This decision upholds protections for journalists against such claims.</p>

          <p>NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff will transition to MSNBC full-time as the progressive cable channel spins off into a new standalone company named Versant. This separation means MSNBC will develop its own editorial operations, no longer relying on NBC News resources, and will remove the NBC peacock from its logo. Soboroff, known for his aggressive coverage of southern border issues, is the highest-profile talent to make this move. While most NBC News staffers are staying with the broadcast network, a surprising number of correspondents and executives are opting for Versant, despite the challenges facing cable TV.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has begun dismantling loudspeakers along its border with North Korea, a move aimed at easing tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang. These loudspeakers, previously used to broadcast music and news into the tightly controlled North, were a point of contention for Kim Jong Un's regime. The initiative aligns with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to de-escalate relations since taking office in June. Despite North Korea's calls for their removal, the North has also indicated a lack of interest in dialogue, stating the relationship has moved beyond "compatriotism."</p>

          <h2>Pharmacist Explains Why Many Penicillin Allergies Are Misdiagnosed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 09:51:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical associate professor of pharmacy explains that a significant number of reported penicillin allergies are misdiagnosed, with far fewer people actually allergic than commonly believed. Many individuals are labeled as allergic in childhood due to rashes accompanying infections, not the antibiotic itself, or from non-allergic side effects like nausea. Furthermore, about 80% of true penicillin allergies are lost after about 10 years, and they are not hereditary. Incorrectly believing one has an allergy can lead to less effective, more expensive, and broader-spectrum antibiotic treatments, increasing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Consulting a healthcare professional can help determine true allergy status.</p>
