          <h2>Constellation Energy Shares Surge After Meta Signs Nuclear Power Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 06:44:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Constellation Energy's stock value increased by 15% after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company. Beginning in June 2027, Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which is the entire output from the site's one nuclear reactor. The agreement supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was in danger of closing due to the expiration of zero-emission credits. The plant will continue to provide power to the regional grid, contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has condemned efforts to erase the Jewish people's historical connection to the Land of Israel. Huckabee cites archaeological evidence, such as excavations at the City of David, as validation of the biblical record. His remarks come amid diplomatic efforts by the Palestinian Authority to revise historical narratives in international forums. Huckabee emphasized that continued archaeological discoveries affirm the scriptural narrative connecting the Jewish people to the land.</p>

          <p>The US State Department is intensifying its competition with China in Africa by introducing performance metrics for American ambassadors based on the number of business deals they secure. This shift is part of the US government's new "trade, not aid" approach. President Trump's administration has secured 33 deals worth US$6 billion across the continent within its first 100 days. The new strategy focuses on countries where US companies want to do business, contrasting with China's growing economic influence in Africa.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues in favor of adding work requirements to Medicaid, citing past successes with similar rules in welfare and other benefit programs. The author contends that work rules provide a necessary push and support network for individuals to enter the job market, increasing employment and life benefits. The proposed Medicaid work rules exclude vulnerable populations and aim to connect able-bodied individuals with job placement services, ultimately helping them reclaim the power of a job.
