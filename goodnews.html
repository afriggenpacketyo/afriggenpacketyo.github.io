          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term, a rare occurrence in recent Australian politics. This decline occurred against a backdrop of mostly closed Asian markets due to holidays and global trade uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell by 0.83%, reversing previous gains, while the Australian dollar saw a slight appreciation against the US dollar. Oil prices also dropped significantly after OPEC+ agreed to increase production, adding to the market's volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Silent book clubs are gaining popularity as a way for people to socialize while enjoying their own choice of reading material in a shared, quiet space. Unlike traditional book clubs, these gatherings allow members to read whatever they like, followed by an optional discussion about their books. The concept originated in San Francisco in 2012 and has since expanded to over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries, providing a relaxed and mindful environment for readers seeking connection without pressure. The rise in silent book clubs reflects a resurgence in people looking for 'third spaces' that aren't focused on drinking or dating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption crackdown targeting high-ranking officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. The campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is considered limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters might be a contributing factor. In the past two years, several high-profile military figures have been investigated and removed from their positions, including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC). These actions underscore Xi's focus on maintaining discipline and loyalty within the military.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The election of a new Pope is signaled by smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel, a tradition that dates back centuries. The process involves meticulous engineering, including custom-built chimneys and stoves, along with precise chemical recipes to ensure the smoke is clearly black or white. The tradition serves as a form of communication with the outside world while maintaining the strict confidentiality of the vote. Despite modern advancements in communication, the Vatican preserves this ritual due to its symbolic significance and connection to religious traditions.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its in-house beagle laboratory following scrutiny over its treatment of the animals.
