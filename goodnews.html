          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for the match against Andorra due to fitness concerns, as he only completed one full training session during the week. Coach Thomas Tuchel is considering unconventional lineup choices, potentially positioning Chelsea's Reece James as a left-back and Liverpool's Curtis Jones on the right side of defense. Other options include Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa and Newcastle's Dan Burn in central defense. Chelsea's Cole Palmer is anticipated to debut, while Declan Rice may rest, giving opportunities to Jordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham in central roles, with Harry Kane leading the attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade-long study of parents who raised high-achieving children reveals five key strategies focusing on optimism, personalized motivation, and the importance of fostering a love for learning. Parents encouraged their children to think big and stay positive, with an emphasis on tailoring motivation to each child's interests. The study also highlighted the significance of learning through everyday tasks and experiences, promoting self-sufficiency rather than intervening in small struggles. Developmental psychologists are shifting focus to fostering a love of learning and curiosity, which can be encouraged through travel and exploration. The most successful parents motivated their children with love and support, rather than acting as coaches or critics.</p>

          <p>The age-adjusted death rate for cancer in the US has decreased by about a third since 1991, thanks to advances in treatments and prevention strategies. Breakthroughs in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence to a manageable condition. The decline in smoking has also contributed to reduced cancer deaths, along with better and earlier screening methods. Immunotherapies, particularly CAR-T therapy, show promising results in turning a patient's own T-cells into guided missiles, offering new hope for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.</p>

          <p>Bieke Depoorter's new book, Blinked Myself Awake, explores the history of astronomy and the relationship between photography and objectivity. Depoorter combines memoir and image in a series of eclectic riffs on the history of astronomy, the practice of stargazing, and the relationship between photography and objectivity. She finds her subjects not in celestial bodies but in the people observing them, drawn to their devotion to what lies beyond. Her images remind us that all knowledge begins first with wonder, and with looking up.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Debunking False Claims About Wind Energy</h2>

          <p>DW Fact Check addresses false claims about wind energy amplified on social media, countering disinformation about wind power. Claims that windmills are driving whales crazy are refuted by NOAA Fisheries, which cites boat strikes, entanglement in fishnets, and climate change as the main threats to whales. While wind turbines do kill birds, they account for a relatively small fraction of bird mortality compared to cats, collisions with buildings, and vehicles. Concerns about recycling wind turbines are addressed by highlighting efforts to recycle components and the development of next-generation recyclable rotor blades.</p>
