          <p>Amazon has established a new group within its consumer product-development division, Lab126, to concentrate on agentic artificial intelligence. The team will develop an agentic AI framework for use in its robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI," enabling robots to understand and act on natural language commands. These systems aim to transform warehouse robots into adaptable assistants, building on Amazon's previous AI initiatives, such as a web browser-based agent and the Alexa+ update. This move reflects the growing trend of companies developing AI agents capable of complex, multistep actions on behalf of users.</p>

          <p>The English government plans to extend free school meal eligibility to an additional 500,000 children, ensuring that any child whose parents receive Universal Credit can claim free meals regardless of income starting in September 2026. This change, funded with ¬£1 billion up to 2029, aims to save parents ¬£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has also pledged ¬£13 million to food charities to redistribute surplus food from farms, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized that feeding more children for free is a major intervention to alleviate poverty and support children's education. While welcomed by the education sector, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child limit, would be more effective.</p>

          <p>Mike Jerrick, a co-host on FOX29's "Good Day Philadelphia," learned he had skin cancer during a live segment about skin care. While discussing skin checks with dermatologist Dr. Joanna Walker, a spot on Jerrick's elbow was identified as basal cell carcinoma. Walker explained that it is a common and treatable type of skin cancer that would likely need to be surgically removed. Jerrick expressed surprise but remained calm, and is scheduled to have the spot removed, urging viewers to get similar markings checked. This news underscores the importance of regular skin examinations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of arrests were made across 28 states in a coordinated effort to curb rising rates of organized retail theft, led by the Cook County Regional Organized Crime Taskforce. The initiative involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and more than 30 major retailers, including Target, Macy's, and Walgreens, who provided critical information. Organized retail crime involves coordinated theft operations, often reselling stolen goods for profit, with authorities noting the increasing sophistication and prevalence of this crime. The crackdown aims to deter such conduct by demonstrating that it is being prosecuted and taken seriously.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed an innovative solution to President Trump's efforts to undermine civil service protections by neutralizing federal agencies. The Merit Systems Protection Board, which hears claims of civil servants being illegally fired, lacks a quorum due to Trump's actions. The Fourth Circuit's decision in National Association of Immigration Judges v. Owen suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, courts should hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected, but its fate depends on a potential appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Jacinda Ardern, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, defied typical political norms through her leadership style. Whether it was her historic win in 2017, or becoming only the second woman elected to lead a country to give birth while in office, Ardern was never a typical politician. But perhaps the most norm-busting feature of her time as Prime Minister was her rejection of the old ways of leadership. Ardern is now emphasizing the need to lead with kindness and empathy as she reflects on her time as Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The German government is streamlining the process for declaring countries of origin as safe, aiming to reduce the number of asylum seekers. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet approved a policy allowing a country to be declared safe with a simple statutory order, removing the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated the move is part of a broader effort to implement an "asylum turnaround." The reform, which still requires Bundestag approval, has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers and NGOs.</p>
