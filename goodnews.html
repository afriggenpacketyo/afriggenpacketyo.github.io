          <p>China has called on the European Union to provide a fair playing field for businesses following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, many of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, while a 50-cent fee would apply to parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment and hopes the EU will uphold its commitment to openness and transparency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. James Butterfill of CoinShares noted that broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S., such as the GENIUS Act, and support from President Trump and his crypto advisor David Sacks, have also boosted the market. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a former bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is back online after being inaccessible for several hours due to ongoing disruptions following a cyber attack. Customers have been unable to place online orders for weeks, and the retailer estimates the cyber attack will reduce this year's profits by around £300 million. The attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, resulted in the theft of some personal customer data, including telephone numbers, home addresses, and dates of birth. Police are investigating a group of English-speaking hackers known as Scattered Spider, believed to be responsible for attacks on other retailers as well. (not investment advice)</p>
