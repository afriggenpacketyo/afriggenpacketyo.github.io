          <p>President Trump announced the nomination of Michael Waltz as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, following Waltz's service as National Security Advisor. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will take on the role of interim National Security Advisor in addition to his current duties. The decision followed scrutiny of Waltz after he inadvertently added a reporter to a Signal chat discussing a U.S. military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Vice President JD Vance defended Waltz, stating that the move was not a firing but a strategic reassignment, and Waltz expressed his honor to continue serving President Trump and the nation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing expectations despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, indicating a stable labor market, and the labor force participation rate ticked higher to 62.6%. Health care, transportation, warehousing, and financial activities saw significant job gains, while the federal government experienced a slight decline. While the report alleviates immediate recession concerns, economists caution that the economy may weaken in the coming months if tariff tensions persist, and the report serves as a benchmark against which to measure future tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>President Trump reiterated his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following a better-than-expected jobs report for April. He stated that there is no inflation and that the Fed should lower its rate. This continues Trump's pattern of attempting to influence the central bank's decision-making, despite its independence. Trump has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but has recently scaled back his attacks, and his message contrasts with his blaming of former President Biden for a recent economic contraction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order seeking to cut public funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), citing left-wing bias. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funding for the two outlets, arguing that government funding of news media is corrosive to journalistic independence. Public media are expected to fight the order, with PBS exploring all options to continue serving the American public. NPR stated that eliminating funding would have a devastating impact on communities that rely on public radio for news and information.</p>

          <p>New York City experienced an outflow of high-earning residents between 2017 and 2022, resulting in a loss of billions of dollars in income, according to a Citizens Budget Commission report.

The 10-meter long fragment of the vessel was found in good condition, preserved by the damp sand. Experts believe the ship is of Mediterranean-style construction with Atlantic influences, possibly from the Basque Country or Galicia. The discovery is considered important due to the rarity of finding underwater archaeological remains, and further studies will be conducted on the keel and wood.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on economic growth and inflation as it considers future interest rate decisions, according to the article. While a solid labor market has allowed the Fed to hold off on rate cuts, the uncertainty caused by tariffs is creating challenges for businesses and consumers. The Fed is now grappling with the potential for tariffs to both dent growth and stoke inflation, creating a dilemma for policymakers. The latest jobs report is welcome news, but officials are debating whether tariff-related price pressures will be temporary or persistent.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his appeal challenging the UK government's decision to strip him of publicly funded security after stepping back from royal duties. The Court of Appeal ruled that the decision to review his protection on a case-by-case basis was not unfair. The judge acknowledged Harry's feelings of grievance but stated that it did not provide legal grounds for challenging the decision. Harry argued that his life was in danger and that he and his family faced hostility and relentless media hounding.</p>
