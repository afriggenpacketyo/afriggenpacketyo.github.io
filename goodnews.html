          <p>A former EU trade negotiator suggests that current tensions between China and the European Union over electric vehicles are not "existential." John Clarke, former head of the EU Delegation to the World Trade Organization, believes both sides are motivated to cooperate more closely on trade and green initiatives to counter potential disruptions from a second Trump presidency. Clarke emphasizes the need for Chinese environmental technology and goods, such as electric vehicles and solar panels, to achieve the EU‚Äôs net-zero emissions target by 2050, viewing China as a key partner in an affordable green transition. This comes as China-EU relations seek a reset amidst global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the legacy of Justice David Souter, highlighting his decision to retire from the Supreme Court at a relatively young age as an example of knowing when to step aside. French contrasts Souter's choice with the trend of politicians and judges clinging to power well into old age, noting the potential consequences for the nation. He argues that the desire to remain powerful, combined with the support of enablers and an apathetic public, contributes to this problem. French also emphasizes the importance of defining oneself beyond one's career, advocating for a life centered on family and virtue. He touches on Pope Leo's focus on love and compassion.</p>

          <p>New research has identified the genetic mutation responsible for the orange color in cats, solving a long-standing mystery. Two studies published in Current Biology detail how researchers collected DNA samples from hundreds of cats with the help of cat owners. The team at Stanford discovered that a missing piece of DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene is responsible for the orange mutation. This discovery intersects with the same pathway that is responsible for red hair in humans, but it affects that pathway in a completely different way.</p>

          <p>Molly Conisbee, a historian of death and bereavement counselor, reflects on how societies have historically managed death and grief, drawing lessons for contemporary approaches. She contrasts the past, where death was often managed at home with community involvement, with today's medicalized and institutionalized processes. Conisbee argues that engaging with the idea of mortality can be liberating and suggests that modern society can learn from the past's compassionate acknowledgment of grief. She highlights the resurgence of interest in practices like death doulas and involving family in caring for the deceased.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's rally reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Favorable regulatory developments in the U.S., along with support from President Trump and JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, have further boosted the market.
