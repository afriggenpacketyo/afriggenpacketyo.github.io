        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following two days of trade negotiations in London, US President Donald Trump announced a wide-ranging agreement with China, aiming to maintain the truce established after prior talks in Geneva. The deal purportedly addresses several contentious issues, including rare earth mineral shipments, student visas, and tariffs. While Trump declared the accord "done" on his Truth Social platform, Chinese representatives have remained reserved, stating they will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. The specifics of the agreement and its long-term implications are still emerging.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung has ordered the cessation of loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, fulfilling a campaign promise aimed at reducing cross-border tensions. In response, North Korea appears to have halted its own loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea sent trash-filled balloons into the South. This move signals Seoul's intent to reopen communication channels with Pyongyang, though the path forward remains uncertain due to North Korea's continued rejection of diplomatic overtures.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced increased annual funding for the NHS in England by ¬£29 billion, along with additional funds for defense and housing, outlining the government's spending plans until the end of the decade. The Spending Review also includes investments in artificial intelligence and transport projects, but entails budget cuts for departments like the Foreign Office and the environment. The government aims to provide security, economic growth, and a future-proof NHS, while the opposition criticizes the plan as a "spend now, tax later review". Housing and health are big winners, while some other departments face budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded detailed observations of a nova, a dying star's temporary brightening, near the Milky Way. The official account, rediscovered recently, confirms that the event was a nova, not a comet or meteor, and provides unprecedented details about the star's size and brightness. This discovery, reported in The Astronomical Journal, helps modern astronomers narrow down the star's possible position. The astronomers interpreted the star's appearance as a heavenly endorsement of Emperor Yongle's reign.</p>
