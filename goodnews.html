          <p>President Trump has spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday. It would be their first known call since Trump began his second term with a focus on higher tariffs on imports of Chinese goods. Trump had started the trade war in February by applying a new 10% tariff ‚Äî a number that climbed as 145% by April, with Beijing retaliating with tariffs of its own. The U.S. lowered its rate to 30% on Chinese goods, and China cut its tariffs to 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan began selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka on Thursday. Japan and the European Union plan to begin negotiations to conclude an accord to facilitate exchanges of classified security information, an EU source said Thursday. Japan's Emperor Naruhito, Empress Masako and their daughter Princess Aiko paid their respects Thursday in Okinawa to victims of a Japanese evacuation ship that was torpedoed by a U.S. submarine during World War II. A Chinese man detained in late May on suspicion of murdering two Japanese nationals in Dalian, northeastern China, was involved in a financial dispute with the victims, who were his business partners.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday amid an ongoing dispute over a temporary deal to ease the escalation of tariffs between the U.S. and China. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said the two leaders spoke Thursday morning at Mr. Trump's request. Last week, Mr. Trump accused China of violating the May 12 deal. On "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he was expecting the two leaders to resolve their issues when they spoke. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russell Martin made a smart-casual first impression as Rangers' head coach. He was grateful and excited to be Rangers' head coach. Yet, he also possessed a steely determination to make a success of the job and has an unswerving belief in his methods and ability. Broadcasters and newspaper reporters fired questions at him about budgets, expectations, winning trophies and the struggle with Southampton in the Premier League that quickly cost him his job on the south coast. He hinted that he can be far more adaptable than people think, but there are certain core beliefs, those non-negotiables, that he will never compromise.</p>
