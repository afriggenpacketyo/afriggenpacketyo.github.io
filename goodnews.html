          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund President Donald Trump's appeal in the $83 million defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's request for Justice Department lawyers to represent him, stemming from Carroll's accusation that Trump sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s, an allegation he denies. The DOJ had argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, justifying their representation, but the court disagreed. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24, adding another layer to the ongoing legal battle.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile Massachusetts murder retrial. Jurors, after four days of deliberation, acquitted Read of the most serious charges but convicted her of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. Read's first trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury, and the second trial included extensive testimony and scrutiny of evidence.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at William & Mary University in Virginia have unearthed a secret cellar beneath the Williamsburg Bray School, the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children. The cellar contained artifacts including slate pencil fragments and jewelry, providing insights into the school's history and the lives of its mostly enslaved students in the 1760s. The discoveries also included handmade ceramics associated with sites of enslavement and a shard of glass depicting Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom. The structure, discovered in 2020, is currently undergoing restoration by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are driving up the costs of materials used in home remodeling projects, causing homeowners to reconsider renovations. Suppliers have already increased prices for lumber, steel, and aluminum, potentially adding $10,000 to a typical project. Experts advise homeowners to pre-order materials, lock in prices with suppliers, and prioritize essential repairs, particularly exterior damage. A fresh paint job is suggested as a cost-effective alternative to purchasing new appliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The author argues for the importance of public pools in America, highlighting their benefits for mental, physical, and social health. Pools are described as essential for mood-boosting exercise and providing a sense of buoyancy and embrace. Historically, public pools served as community hubs, but desegregation led to their decline as suburbanites retreated to private pools. The author advocates for revitalizing public pools as resource-intensive endeavors that would promote health, happiness, and community, especially during increasingly hot summers.</p>

Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the long-lasting impact of wet wipe pollution and the need for reusable alternatives. The ban follows a 2023 law prohibiting single-use plastic products and includes an 18-month transition period for manufacturers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for a further 90 days. The video-sharing app has faced questions over its future after the US passed a law last year requiring the app to be banned unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Lawmakers said it posed a risk to national security - something TikTok denies. In a statement, TikTok said it was "grateful for President Trump's leadership and support" in keeping the app online for its 170m US users.</p>
