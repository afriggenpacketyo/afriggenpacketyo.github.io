          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals connected to an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans. Authorities collaborated to disrupt the attack, which was reportedly planned by a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community and aimed to radicalize teenagers. The suspects included the alleged leader of the group, arrested on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager arrested on child pornography charges. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of any safety concerns prior to or during the show, which was intended to boost Rio's economy, and that they worked closely with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured victory at the Miami Grand Prix, leading Lando Norris in a McLaren one-two finish, extending Piastri's lead in the championship standings. The race featured early drama with Verstappen running wide and Norris losing positions after contact. Piastri overtook Antonelli and then Verstappen to take the lead, which he maintained despite pressure from Norris. This marks McLaren's first three-race winning streak since 1998, with Hamilton being allowed past Leclerc to chase Antonelli but failing to make a significant impact.</p>

          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her Wisconsin home in 1962 at the age of 20, was found "alive and well" after nearly 63 years. A detective reviewing the cold case uncovered new information suggesting Backeberg's disappearance was voluntary. Backeberg, now 82, is living outside of Wisconsin and was located through her sister's ancestry.com account. Detective Hanson spoke with Backeberg who sounded happy, confident in her decision, and without regrets, suggesting that an abusive marriage may have contributed to her initial choice to leave.</p>

SpaceX seeks to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year. The company has stated that creating a city would allow them to better manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for residents.</p>
