          <p>Reddit's stock experienced a significant surge, climbing as high as 19% in after-hours trading, following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both sales and guidance. The company's revenue increased by 61% year over year, reaching $392 million, and net income turned positive at $26.2 million, a stark contrast to the $575.1 million loss from the previous year due to IPO-related costs. Reddit also reported a substantial increase in daily active users, both logged-in and logged-out, demonstrating the platform's growing reach and engagement. Despite acknowledging the shaky economy and Google search-related challenges, Reddit remains optimistic about its position and future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant cabinet reshuffle, nominating Michael Waltz as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the interim national security advisor. This decision follows increasing frustration with Waltz after a Signal chat mishap involving a reporter and sensitive military information. Rubio, who will maintain his role as Secretary of State, expressed readiness to serve in both capacities, while Waltz conveyed honor in continuing service to the President.

Druse leaders have since expressed openness to integrating into the national military and have agreed to the deployment of government forces to secure key roads.

          <p>New York lawmakers are contemplating a measure that would significantly weaken oversight of religious schools, particularly impacting Hasidic Jewish schools, which may face reduced scrutiny despite receiving substantial taxpayer funding. This proposal has sparked concern among education experts, including State Education Commissioner Betty Rosa, who views it as a disservice to children attending schools lacking a basic secular education. The potential changes could involve delaying consequences for non-compliant private schools and lowering educational standards. The Hasidic community, which has long opposed government oversight, sees this as a crucial political issue.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's recent discouragement of using the Signal messaging app, a photo taken during a Cabinet meeting shows former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz seemingly communicating with other Trump officials on the app. The photo reveals active conversations with at least six other users, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The continued use of Signal by top officials comes after a controversy earlier this year when Waltz inadvertently added a reporter to a Signal thread discussing pending military strikes, leading to security concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face immediate secondary sanctions, barring them from conducting business with the U.S. This announcement aims to intensify the "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, seeking to completely halt the country's oil exports. Trump accused Iran of funding militant groups throughout the Middle East and reiterated his goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The move is primarily directed at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, and underscores Trump's strategy of negotiating through strength.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that weight loss drugs like semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic) may offer significant benefits for patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a type of fatty liver disease. The study, involving approximately 800 patients, demonstrated that semaglutide effectively reduced liver inflammation and scarring. While the results are promising, experts caution that longer-term studies are needed to confirm the findings. MASH affects an estimated 17 million Americans and can lead to severe liver complications.</p>

Despite this, the company's stock dipped in after-hours trading, likely due to lower-than-expected revenue in its services division and sales in China. Investors have been closely monitoring Apple's performance amid concerns about the impact of sweeping tariffs on its supply chains.

Brooks argues that this ethos, reminiscent of ancient Rome, threatens to unleash brutality and undermine compassion. He contrasts this with moral traditions like Judaism and Christianity, which emphasize humility, justice, and self-sacrificial love. Brooks advocates for seeking rehumanizing influences through art, literature, and selfless service to others as a way to counter the dehumanizing forces of the age.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court in an effort to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. The administration argues that a lower court's decision to delay the termination undermines the Executive Branch's authority over immigration policy. The TPS program, established in 1990, provides temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing crises, allowing them to apply for work permits and deportation deferrals. The decision to end TPS for Venezuelans is part of the administration's broader crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>
