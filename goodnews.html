          <p>Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the U.S. lacks a strong tradition of promoting financial literacy, leaving young investors vulnerable to risky 'get-rich-quick' schemes. He cautions against overly complex financial products and advises young people to seek financial information from credible sources rather than platforms like TikTok. Edelman notes that while many young investors lack funds, they are motivated to achieve financial success, especially after seeing their parents struggle with retirement. He also points out the positive trend of more states requiring personal finance courses in high schools.</p>

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's initial tariff announcement, some common household items have experienced price increases, according to a Telsey Advisory Group report. The price of items like Barbie dolls, washing machines, and leggings have risen in the weeks following the announcement. A Target-exclusive Barbie doll increased by nearly 43%, while a Whirlpool washing machine at Lowe's went up by nearly $82. While these changes aren't definitive evidence of tariff impact, retailers and brands indicate that higher costs will likely be passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>The author argues that declining birth rates in the US and worldwide are a serious issue that progressives should address, rather than dismissing due to political polarization. A shrinking population can lead to economic challenges, a smaller workforce supporting a larger elderly population, and a decline in overall quality of life. The author suggests that policies supporting family formation, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare, align with progressive values and could help stabilize the population.</p>

He also highlighted the calmness and solemnity of the process, where everyone was 'peaceful and just wanting to do this well'.</p>
