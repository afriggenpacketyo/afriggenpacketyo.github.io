        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK government figures indicate a strong correlation between student attendance in the first week of the school year and their overall presence throughout the academic term. The data reveals that over half of pupils who were partially absent in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. In response, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize full attendance from the start of the new term to combat the high absenteeism rates that have persisted since the pandemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is uniquely positioned to offer the world a new diplomatic framework based on "constructive pragmatism." As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo could leverage Indonesia's influence to foster cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a potential corrective model for an international system often paralyzed by competing national agendas and great power rivalries. The article posits that the world needs practical action rather than revolutionary rhetoric to address global challenges.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presented as a large-scale, ambitious project funded by Netflix. The film, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, explores the story from both characters' perspectives over a 149-minute runtime. Del Toro, known for his empathetic portrayal of monsters, emphasized his desire to present the creature as a beautiful, newborn being rather than an accident victim. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its artistry and scale while others found it lacked substance.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II approaches, there is a renewed focus on the shared history of Sino-American cooperation as a potential model for improving current bilateral relations. This perspective highlights the forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen during the war. The article suggests that recalling this period of mutual support and shared sacrifice could offer a foundation for building better ties from the ground up, moving beyond contemporary geopolitical tensions and focusing on a legacy of partnership.</p>

          <p>A proposal to silence a 150-year-old town clock in Machynlleth, Wales, between midnight and 7 a.m. has been rejected by the local town council. The request came from the owner of the Wynnstay Hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes throughout the night. However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, a sentiment echoed by some local residents. The hotel owner expressed disappointment with the decision and is considering gathering more community feedback before potentially resubmitting the proposal in six months.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which lyrically explores the disappointments and absurdities of dating despite achieving superstardom. Following her successful 2024 album "Short n' Sweet," this new record continues her witty and candid commentary on navigating relationships with unimpressive men. The album, created with producer Jack Antonoff, blends '70s-inspired pop with modern sounds and tackles themes of male incompetence and emotional unavailability. The controversial album cover, depicting Carpenter kneeling before a man, is framed by the article as a satirical critique of social power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the narrow win highlighted persistent issues, particularly with the team's goalkeepers, as another error led to a Burnley goal. Amorim acknowledged the pressure his keepers are under and noted that the entire team is struggling with consistency. The victory is crucial, but it fails to mask the urgent problems the team must address before facing tougher upcoming opponents, including Manchester City.</p>

          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing consolidated advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development. For toddlers, the consensus leans toward being screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world, with a maximum of one hour per day for children aged two and up. As children grow, recommendations shift to supervised, limited use to ensure time for social interaction, imaginative play, and motor skill development. The article stresses that content quality and parental engagement are more critical than strict time limits.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Wales, took matters into their own hands to save thousands of fish stranded in a drying brook following a prolonged period of dry weather.

The group manually moved salmon, trout, and other species to the nearby river. The environmental body, Natural Resources Wales, stated that moving fish during such extreme conditions can cause more harm, but the residents felt they had no choice but to act.</p>
