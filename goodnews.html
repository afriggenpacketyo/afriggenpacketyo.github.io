          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 17:36:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to announce a significant compromise on its proposed welfare reforms following pressure from over 100 of its own backbenchers. According to multiple sources, the deal will protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit from cuts. This climbdown addresses major concerns raised by Labour MPs regarding the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which aims to save ¬£5bn annually by 2030. The government had faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons without these concessions.</p>

          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has made its first confirmed discovery of a planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet designated TWA 7b. Orbiting a young star, this planet is estimated to be about the mass of Saturn and is located approximately 50 times farther from its star than Earth is from the Sun. Scientists utilized a technique called high-contrast imaging, using a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, evidence strongly indicates it is a previously undiscovered planet.</p>

          <p>During a live ESPN interview at the 2025 NBA Draft, the mother of first-round pick Danny Wolf mistakenly said she was excited for her son to go to New York. Wolf, who was selected 27th overall by the Brooklyn Nets, was seen gently mouthing "Brooklyn" to correct her, a polite clarification to distinguish from their rivals, the New York Knicks. The heartwarming moment occurred on a busy night for the Nets, who acquired five new players in the first round of the draft. Wolf, a forward from Michigan, was celebrated for his accomplishment amidst the harmless family flub.</p>

          <p>A California state appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top adviser to ex-L.A. County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n, in a sharp rebuke to the state attorney general's prosecution. Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police records, but her defense successfully argued the documents were publicly available court records. The court's unanimous ruling affirmed that her actions were not criminal, as the information was accessible to the public. This decision concludes a politically charged case that critics alleged was a misuse of prosecutorial resources against a public servant focused on police accountability.</p>

The concert covered his entire catalog, from his early gothic R&B to his massive pop hits like "Blinding Lights," showcasing his unique vocal talent and stagecraft.

          <p>The sequel "M3GAN 2.0" expands its universe by leaning more into action-comedy than the horror of its predecessor, introducing a new military-grade android named AMELIA. The film sees the original M3GAN doll reconstructed while her creator, Gemma (Allison Williams), ironically becomes an anti-technology crusader. The plot follows a familiar AI-takeover narrative, with the two femmebots eventually clashing, but is elevated by director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor. While the movie offers flashy, B-movie fun, its most intriguing moments are the strange and unpredictable human interactions that surround the central robot conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of the recently-listed stablecoin issuer Circle resumed their rally Thursday, gaining 7% after a brief pullback. The volatility and growing awareness of Circle's business model, which involves earning interest on reserves backing its USDC stablecoin, appear to be positively impacting its main distribution partner, Coinbase. Coinbase stock also gained over 5%, as investors recognize its potential benefits from the expanding stablecoin market. The market is closely watching potential Fed rate cuts, which could affect Circle's earnings, and progress on U.S. stablecoin regulation. (not investment advice)</p>
