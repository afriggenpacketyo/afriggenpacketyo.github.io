The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct another round of interviews before presenting a shorter list to President Trump for the final decision. The nominee may first be appointed as a Fed governor to secure a full 14-year term before being elevated to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

The Nobel Committee highlighted her bravery and steadfast resistance against the country's expanding authoritarianism, calling her a symbol of hope for a future where citizens' rights are protected. The announcement emphasized the global trend of democracy being in retreat and praised Machado for uniting the opposition and consistently supporting a non-violent path.

The agreement's first phase includes the release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the deal, the IDF will maintain control over more than half of Gaza, and an increase in humanitarian aid is expected. The U.S. Central Command is setting up a coordination center in Israel with 200 personnel to monitor the truce and assist with aid logistics.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is formally requesting information from Apple, Google, Snapchat, and YouTube regarding their measures to protect children online. European Union officials expressed concern that existing practices may not be sufficient to ensure the high levels of privacy, security, and safety required for minors using their services. The inquiry will examine how easily age restrictions are circumvented on platforms like YouTube and whether their algorithms foster addiction. It will also investigate access to gambling apps on app stores and the enforcement of age limits on Snapchat, with potential fines up to 6% of global turnover for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>Actress Alex Kingston, known for her roles in 'ER' and 'Doctor Who,' has revealed she was diagnosed with womb cancer last year. The 62-year-old star, currently a contestant on 'Strictly Come Dancing,' underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, which concluded in late 2024. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after finding blood in her urine. She shared her story to urge other women not to ignore potential health issues and credited the experience with inspiring her to participate in the dancing competition, embracing a "life is too short" philosophy.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman grave marker discovered in a New Orleans backyard has been traced back to a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II. The soldier's granddaughter, Erin Scott O’Brien, explained that her grandfather brought the 1,900-year-old artifact home as a souvenir. Unaware of its historical significance, she later used the marble tablet as a garden decoration at her home, leaving it behind when she moved in 2018. The new homeowners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the Latin inscription and determined it was a headstone reported missing from an Italian museum, prompting its repatriation via the FBI's art crime team.</p>

          <p>In the small Irish town of Lisdoonvarna, a 150-year-old matchmaking festival continues to draw thousands of visitors each September, offering an old-fashioned alternative to modern dating apps. The event, which originated as a gathering for farmers seeking wives after the harvest, is now centered around Willie Daly, the town's third-generation matchmaker. Despite a decline in attendance since the pandemic, many still come for the music, dancing, and the chance for a face-to-face connection. Participants express frustration with the superficiality of online dating, seeking the earnest, community-focused atmosphere that the festival provides.</p>

          <p>The United States will deploy up to 200 troops, already stationed in the Middle East, to Israel to help monitor the new ceasefire in Gaza. These forces will not enter Gaza but will form the core of a multinational civil-military coordination center designed to oversee the truce and coordinate humanitarian aid. The taskforce, led by U.S. Central Command, is expected to include personnel from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. This move is part of the first phase of a broader peace plan, which commenced with the ceasefire and the planned exchange of hostages and prisoners between Israel and Hamas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines Washington Irving's classic story "Rip Van Winkle" as a foundational American folktale that explores the nation's relationship with memory and change. Published in 1819, the story of a man who sleeps through the Revolutionary War is presented not just as a comic tale but as a meditation on creating a new national identity while retaining ties to the past. The essay argues that the story's purpose was to provide a color of romance and tradition to a young country largely lacking in its own mythology. By becoming a beloved patriarch and a living link to the pre-war era, Rip himself becomes a story the nation knows by heart.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores how Abraham Lincoln viewed the American Revolution not as a static, historical event to be worshipped, but as an unfinished project with living ideals. Facing a civil war where both sides claimed to be the Revolution's true heirs, Lincoln confronted the injustice of slavery as a threat that could invalidate the nation's founding principles. He argued that the Declaration of Independence set a standard of universal equality to be "constantly approximated" over generations. By framing the Civil War and emancipation as a "new birth of freedom," Lincoln sought to redeem the past and fully realize the noblest values of 1776 for all people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Amanda Vaill's book 'Pride and Pleasure,' using the lives of the Schuyler sisters—Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy—to explore the often-overlooked role of women in the American Revolution. It argues that women's history should not be a sideshow to the main narrative of public power, but a central part of it, as the revolution began in the household. The essay highlights Eliza Schuyler Hamilton's long widowhood, during which she became a pioneering activist, founding an orphan asylum and preserving the historical records of the Founders. This work demonstrates how women shaped the early republic, both in private and through their own burgeoning public influence.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Colonial Williamsburg, America's largest living-history museum, is navigating the challenge of presenting a complete and truthful account of the nation's founding. The museum has evolved from a nostalgic, patriotic vision to one that directly confronts the paradox of liberty and slavery, often making visitors uncomfortable. Interpreters portraying figures like Thomas Jefferson and the enslaved spy James Armistead Lafayette engage with the public on these difficult topics daily. The recent excavation of the historic First Baptist Church, founded by enslaved and free Black worshippers, further highlights the site's commitment to telling the stories of all its historical residents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" rather than a verifiable statement of fact. The court determined that a reasonable listener would understand the accusations within the context of a heated and hyperbolic rap battle, not as fact-checked content. Drake had sued the record label, which represents both artists, alleging the track tarnished his reputation and led to security threats at his home.</p>

          <p>The Tenement Museum in New York City offers an immersive approach to U.S. history by focusing on the lives of ordinary immigrant, migrant, and African American families from the 1860s to the 1980s. By recreating the apartments of real families, the museum makes history tangible, allowing students to connect with the personal stories of people their own age. This method contrasts with traditional history education that centers on powerful leaders and founding documents. Educators and authors praise the museum for showing that everyone, regardless of their station, is a part of the American story, fostering a more inclusive and patriotic understanding of the nation's past.</p>
