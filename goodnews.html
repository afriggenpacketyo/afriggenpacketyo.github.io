          <p>China has officially endorsed Brazil's $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a significant fund designed to reward nations for preserving these vital ecosystems. Developed with the World Bank, the initiative will invest in low-risk assets, channeling returns to tropical countries based on forest preservation, with a fifth of resources for Indigenous communities. Brazilian President Lula da Silva announced his nation's $1 billion contribution, urging others to make ambitious pledges before COP30. He emphasized the scheme as a crucial investment against climate chaos, providing predictable, long-term finance for tropical forest nations.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey delivered a punchy speech, notably focusing on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage over 30 times, far more than the Prime Minister. The party sees an opportunity to challenge Reform and Donald Trump in ways Labour and the Tories might not, aiming to motivate activists and donations through this strategy. However, the Lib Dems also acknowledge Reform's rise squeezes attention on their own party, leading to protests about media coverage. They are seeking to attract recent Conservative voters disaffected by both Reform and the current Tory leadership, buoyed by internal polling suggesting openness to their party.</p>

          <p>Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer, is reportedly planning to raise $15 billion to $20 billion in capital through a private placement, aiming for a valuation of around $500 billion. This ambitious target would place the crypto company's worth on par with major private entities like OpenAI and SpaceX. The transaction, involving new equity, is in early stages, but signals Tether's growing market confidence and strategic moves. The company has recently pursued a return to the U.S. market, aligning with President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, including naming a U.S. CEO and launching a new regulated token under the GENIUS Act.

This operational site, leased by Oracle and filled with Nvidia chips, is one of several planned across the U.S., with the initiative now totaling nearly 7 gigawatts and over $400 billion in investment over three years. OpenAI's CFO Sarah Friar emphasized the "massive compute crunch" driving this rapid expansion, stating the project will generate $13 billion in revenue this year.

          <p>Micron Technology reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, along with a robust forecast for the current quarter, leading to a rise in its stock. The company's overall revenue surged by 46% year-over-year, largely propelled by the artificial intelligence boom, as its high-bandwidth memory is crucial for advanced AI chips like Nvidia's. Micron's CEO Sanjay Mehrotra emphasized the company's unique position as the sole U.S.-based memory manufacturer to capitalize on the AI opportunity. While its largest unit, selling memory for cloud providers, saw sales more than triple, its core data center business unit experienced an annual sales decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Marlon Wayans has taken to social media to defend his latest film, "HIM," after it received negative critical reviews, currently holding a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes. Wayans encouraged fans to form their own opinions, asserting that "innovation is not always embraced and art is to be interpreted and it's subjective." He highlighted his career history of making critically panned movies like "White Chicks" and the "Scary Movie" franchise that later became classics embraced by audiences. The article underscores his belief that critical opinions do not always reflect public sentiment or a film's lasting cultural impact, urging viewers to experience the film themselves.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has averted all 1,600 projected city worker layoffs, initially threatened by a $1 billion budget shortfall. This achievement follows months of negotiations and cost-cutting measures, including scaling back LAPD hiring and agreements with unions. The Coalition of Los Angeles City Unions agreed to up to five unpaid holidays in 2026, while police and engineers' unions also made concessions. The city also relocated some employees to open positions in other departments. While this is good news for the current fiscal year, Councilmember Tim McOsker cautioned that budget challenges persist, necessitating long-term solutions.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system in 2026, allowing players to dispute called balls and strikes in regular and postseason games. This system, powered by Hawk-Eye technology and tested in minor leagues, aims to balance the umpire's role with correcting missed calls, while maintaining game pace. Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if a call is overturned, but losing it if upheld. Players have expressed support for the system's efficiency and positive impact on umpire performance, marking a significant step in baseball's integration of technology for officiating.</p>

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted this as the "next leap forward" in powering AI.

The Biden-era credits, offering $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, have spurred record sales, with new EV sales up 17.7% and used up 59% year-over-year in August. Dealerships are also offering incentives to clear inventory before new models arrive. While September could be a historic month for EV sales, experts anticipate a potential slowdown in October, as automakers have already begun to reduce EV production in response to policy changes.

While fixed rates offer payment stability, borrowers can also consider a variable-rate Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) at an average of 8.05%, which could become cheaper with future Fed cuts.

          <p>A bull moose that fell into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well in Pembroke, Maine, was successfully rescued in an elaborate five-hour operation. The animal was discovered by Cole Brown, whose family owns the forested land, prompting a call to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Wardens sedated the moose, then used an excavator provided by the family to carefully lift it to safety. Once the sedation wore off, the moose ran off, seemingly unharmed, with the agency noting it was "no worse for wear other than perhaps his bruised ego." The family, unaware of the decades-old well, has since capped it to prevent future incidents, with relief and happiness expressed over the successful rescue.</p>
