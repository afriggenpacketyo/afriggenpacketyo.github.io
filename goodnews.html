          <p>A 19-year-old in Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that could potentially cure her rare and life-threatening inherited disorder, APDS. The condition, which severely affects the immune system, had claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives who were instrumental in the research that identified the disease. The treatment, taken as a daily tablet, works by blocking an overactive enzyme and has been hailed as a life-changing medical breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial "revenge tax" provision from President Trump's major legislative package after a formal request from the Treasury Secretary. The provision would have enabled the U.S. to impose taxes on foreign-owned companies from nations deemed to have unfair tax policies, a measure critics warned would deter investment and cost American jobs. The reversal was prompted by a new G7 agreement on a global tax deal, though it complicates efforts to offset the bill's overall cost. (not investment advice)</p>
