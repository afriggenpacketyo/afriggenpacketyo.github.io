          <p>Former President Joe Biden, diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer, stated he feels "optimistic" about his prognosis and is undergoing treatment with medication.

Biden also reflected on the divisiveness in American politics during a Memorial Day service, emphasizing the unity of the military. He highlighted the 10th anniversary of his son Beau's death, sharing personal memories and praising Beau's legacy of service and sacrifice, concluding with a message of remembrance and support for those grieving.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk concluded his tenure as a "special government employee" leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), receiving praise from President Trump for his cost-cutting efforts. While Musk fell short of his initial $1 trillion savings promise, the White House claims DOGE saved $170 billion, though analyses suggest potential costs due to lost productivity. Musk defended DOGE's work, expressing confidence in achieving the $1 trillion goal eventually and reaffirmed his commitment to advising the president. He also publicly dissented from Trump's spending bill, citing concerns about the increasing budget deficit, stating his belief that a bill can be either big or beautiful, but not both.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a 108-run victory against the West Indies, fueled by centuries from Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont. England's clear gameplan was evident as they built a strong opening partnership before accelerating in the final overs. Sciver-Brunt's aggressive batting further boosted England's total, which proved too challenging for the West Indies. The win demonstrates England's potential as they prepare for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed claims of cognitive decline detailed in recent books, joking that he could "beat the hell out of" the authors. Biden's comments came after the release of books like "Original Sin," which alleged mental deterioration during his presidency. Biden's team has refuted these claims, asserting he effectively led the country with empathy and skill. Biden also revealed he has an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer but expressed optimism about his treatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, as investors and union members sought clarity on the proposed merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Trump previously described the deal as a "partnership" with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh and Nippon investing $14 billion. Senator Dave McCormick indicated the U.S. government would have a "golden share" to influence board decisions and ensure production levels are maintained. The deal has faced scrutiny over national security concerns, with a review underway by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).</p>

The partnership revolves around the U.S. government's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) contract, initially awarded to Microsoft, and provides a pathway for Meta to generate a stable source of sales from the U.S. government, potentially improving operating losses in the division (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential for another gold price spike is high this June, although the current price is down from a recent record high. With inflation readings and Federal Reserve meetings on the horizon, the climate is right for another price change. Gold prices typically only rise over time, so investors should explore cost-effective ways to invest, like fractional gold or dollar-cost averaging. Investors should limit gold to 10% or less of their overall portfolio (not investment advice).</p>
