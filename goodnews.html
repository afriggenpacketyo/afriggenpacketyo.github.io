          <p>Leicester City has appointed Marti Cifuentes as its new manager on a three-year contract, following the club's recent relegation from the Premier League. The 43-year-old Spaniard, formerly the head coach of Queens Park Rangers, is tasked with leading the Foxes back to the top flight, a feat they achieved in 2024 under previous manager Enzo Maresca. Cifuentes is the sixth permanent manager for the club in just over two years, and his appointment is seen as a move towards a more modern, progressive style of football.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. While the president provided few specifics in his social media post, he described it as a "great deal, for everybody," achieved through direct negotiations with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later suggested that the agreement involves Indonesia dropping its tariffs on U.S. goods, following a pattern similar to a recent, vaguely detailed deal announced with Vietnam.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a reader seeks guidance on how to cope with the unbearable guilt from a past relationship characterized by mutual verbal abuse, alcoholism, and manipulation. The writer describes a toxic cycle with his ex-girlfriend that included a terminated pregnancy and subsequent harassment, for which he feels deep shame despite now being in a healthy relationship. The columnist advises that the reader has already taken responsibility and made amends, and that the remaining guilt is "unemployed negativity" that serves no purpose and prevents him from fully engaging with his present reality.</p>

CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance, noting it was the markets division's best second quarter since 2020, though the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses due to a "deterioration" in the economic outlook.

The warship was found more than 2,600 feet below the surface in an area known as Iron Bottom Sound, with some of its munitions, including depth charges, still intact. The discovery provides the first images of the vessel in over 80 years and offers new historical insights, disproving a long-held theory that explosions from its own depth charges sealed its fate.</p>
