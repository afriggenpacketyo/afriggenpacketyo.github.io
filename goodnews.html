          <p>President Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating the U.S. would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, effectively doubling the current number. This declaration followed concerns raised by the Chinese embassy regarding alleged harassment and questioning of its students at U.S. customs, particularly in Houston. Trump emphasized a desire for improved relations with China, indicating his administration aims to "get along good" with Beijing and mentioning an invitation to visit China. The move signals a potential de-escalation in diplomatic tensions and a focus on fostering educational exchange despite previous frictions.</p>

South Korean companies pledged $150 billion in U.S. investments, alongside a record $50 billion aviation purchase by Korean Air for Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines. This follows a July trade deal that reduced U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports. The leaders also discussed developing Alaska's natural gas reserves and reaffirmed commitments to regional security, including countering North Korea's nuclear program. These collaborations aim to bolster both nations' economies and strategic alliances.</p>

Experts estimate the industry could exceed $100 billion by 2030, with Goldman Sachs projecting a 0.4% boost to U.S. GDP through increased productivity and healthcare savings. The drugs are already impacting consumer spending, particularly in the food and beverage industry, and prompting innovation from pharmaceutical giants. However, concerns remain about accessibility, potentially creating a two-tier society based on affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, the 75-year-old former kingpin of the Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom to U.S. drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for the extensive harm caused by his organization. Prosecutors detailed his leadership in evolving the cartel into the world's largest, responsible for trafficking at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine and corrupting Mexican police and military. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the plea as a "landmark victory," ensuring Zambada will spend his life in federal prison. This marks a significant win in the U.S. government's anti-cartel efforts.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean in the coming days, posing no threat to land. As of Monday evening, the storm was located about 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, moving northeast at 13 mph. Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating by Wednesday. This development aligns with NOAA's prediction for an above-normal hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin which also remained over open waters.</p>

The rule aims to mitigate fire hazards, as lithium-ion batteries can overheat and combust, and if a fire occurs in the cargo hold, it may go unnoticed.
