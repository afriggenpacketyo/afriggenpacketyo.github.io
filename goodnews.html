        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan found that working-age individuals who regularly consume a traditional Japanese-style diet exhibit lower rates of depressive symptoms. The research assessed a diet consisting of rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, and identified a positive correlation with improved mental well-being. Researchers suggest that specific nutrients, such as the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables, may contribute to this effect by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. The findings point to a potential avenue for public health measures aimed at preventing depression.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large. The escape, which Governor Jeff Landry called the worst in recent state history, has drawn heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. Authorities have arrested at least 16 other individuals accused of aiding the inmates, and a $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final fugitive's capture.</p>

          <p>The century-old idea of phage therapy, which uses viruses to kill bacteria, is gaining renewed interest as a weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. This article follows a journalist's journey to find these bacteriophages, or phages, in his own home, successfully isolating one from his toilet that could kill a patient's urinary tract infection in a lab setting. Scientists explain that phages are highly specific predators of bacteria, offering a potential alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics with fewer side effects. As the threat of antimicrobial resistance grows, researchers are exploring how to make this promising therapy more widely available to patients.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers.

She then presented the paintings to them as gifts, an act that evoked surprise, gratitude, and some regret among the students for not having reached out sooner.

The latest decision, concerning the firm Susman Godfrey, found that the order violated the firm's First and Fifth Amendment rights. This ruling is part of a series of legal defeats for the administration's campaign to use executive power against law firms that represent clients or causes the president opposes. Judges have described the orders as a threat to the independence of the legal profession and an assault on the American system of justice.</p>

The move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a significant effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. Industry unions and advocates have applauded the decision, stating it is a critical step to bring jobs back to California and support the state's economy.

However, Cramer argued that Apple's strong earnings growth rate, which outpaces the S&P 500, justifies a higher valuation.

The show opened with a haunting scene of models dressed in white with their hands tied, kneeling in a formation meant to evoke images of migrants detained in Salvadoran prisons. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance aimed to address the "dehumanization" of immigrants in the United States. The bold move was largely praised online as a revolutionary use of fashion to bring awareness to social injustice, though some criticized it as distasteful.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California as part of a student research program. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will fly between 1,000 and 10,000 feet, performing vertical spirals and other maneuvers to sample atmospheric gasses and measure land and water surfaces. The flights will occur over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. NASA issued the notice to assure the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying aircraft, explaining it is for scientific research.</p>
