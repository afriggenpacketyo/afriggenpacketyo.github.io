          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Residents in the New York City area and as far as Connecticut reported feeling brief shaking, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are rare on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant. Officials compared it to the much larger 4.8 magnitude quake that rattled the region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Singer Justin Timberlake announced via an Instagram post that he has been diagnosed with Lyme disease, an illness transmitted by ticks. He described the condition as potentially "implacably debilitating" both mentally and physically, and admitted he considered ending his tour after the diagnosis. However, he decided to continue performing, stating that the joy he gets from it outweighed the stress on his body. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues if not treated.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party but have not yet chosen a name. Instead of announcing a title, they are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help decide on one that reflects the party's platform. The new venture cannot field candidates in elections until it registers an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties.</p>

The team's public pledge of support for Dončić signals a clear transition of power, leaving James' long-term future with the Lakers uncertain.</p>

          <p>Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it plans to be more "careful" with its open-source strategy going forward. This shift in stance contrasts with China's booming open-source AI ecosystem, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts suggest China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source environment could be a path for it to surpass the U.S. in AI development.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of what killed a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. For decades, it was rumored the creature, named Winston, died from shell-shock during a German U-boat encounter on its voyage from Australia. However, researchers analyzing ship logs and attendant notes have determined that the platypus most likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, debunking the more dramatic wartime tale.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a tool to fuel consumer spending and local economic growth. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is a prime example of this strategy, adding to the nation's over 4,400 amusement facilities. Industry experts note that such attractions act as significant economic drivers, with every yuan of operating revenue generating a much larger impact on the surrounding economy through tourism, hospitality, and retail.
