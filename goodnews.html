          <p>The Natural History Museum in London is set to display a newly discovered dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, a labrador-sized dinosaur that lived approximately 150 million years ago. Initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now recognize it as a distinct species due to unique features in its leg bones. This discovery promises to shed light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and how they evolved into larger, more specialized animals. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs, making this discovery an important contribution to understanding dinosaur diversity in the Late Jurassic period.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are recovering as fears surrounding Chinese startup DeepSeek's potential to surpass leading tech companies subside. He notes that semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, have shown significant gains, signaling renewed investor confidence in the AI sector. The initial panic in January, triggered by DeepSeek's release of an advanced AI model, caused a sharp decline in AI stock values. However, the subsequent recovery suggests that concerns about DeepSeek's dominance were short-lived, refuting the notion that China has overtaken the U.S. in the AI race (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing a narrowed legal definition of gang activity in California. The decision comes after mounting legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased. The injunctions, some in effect since 2006, had restricted suspected gang members from certain activities and associations. Civil rights groups have long challenged gang injunctions as overly broad and draconian, especially as gang violence has declined.</p>
