          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location to protect it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The entire 672-tonne structure is being transported on rolling platforms in a complex, two-day journey. This move is a key part of the broader relocation of the city, funded by the mining company LKAB. For residents, it's an emotional event, preserving a building that has served as a spiritual and community hub for generations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a proposal to take a significant equity stake, potentially around 10%, in semiconductor manufacturer Intel. The plan involves converting grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company shares, which could make the U.S. government a top shareholder. This move is part of a broader national effort to revitalize the American chip industry and bolster national security, as Intel has struggled to keep pace with global competitors. The discussions are ongoing, and it remains uncertain if the plan will be finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal will see actor and investor Ashton Kutcher join the company's board. Soho House, known as a popular venue for celebrities, has faced financial struggles and a decline in share value since its 2021 stock market listing amid concerns it was losing its exclusive appeal. The acquisition aims to put the company on more stable financial footing away from the pressures of public markets.</p>

          <p>The US Open has introduced a revamped mixed doubles event, attracting top singles players like Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek with large cash prizes and a shorter format. The move by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) is intended to generate more fan interest and elevate the event's profile. However, the new format has drawn criticism from some, including doubles specialists like Jamie Murray, who argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and becomes more of a "glorified exhibition." The debate centers on whether the change is a positive promotion for tennis or a move that sidelines dedicated doubles players.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to create facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey, who were deported for crimes ranging from theft to minor offenses like trampling turnips. The AI generated the faces using detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases, photos of modern-day descendants. The project sheds new light on the individuals behind the statistics of the estimated 162,000 convicts sent to Australia, a history that is now often seen as a "badge of honour" by their descendants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tourists are increasingly choosing "coolcations," favoring destinations with more temperate climates over traditional Mediterranean hotspots due to concerns about extreme heatwaves and wildfires. This trend is driving interest in places like Iceland, Norway, and the Scottish Highlands, as well as prompting travelers to book trips during the cooler spring and autumn shoulder seasons. While this shift may alleviate overtourism in southern Europe, it also poses economic challenges for countries like Greece and Spain that are heavily reliant on summer tourism. Experts predict this behavioral shift will solidify, potentially altering Europe's peak travel seasons in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery in West Yorkshire, UK, has successfully met its £3.8 million fundraising target to purchase a rare sculpture by Dame Barbara Hepworth. The piece, "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red," will now go on permanent public display in the artist's hometown. The campaign was supported by over 2,800 public donations, along with major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. Created during World War II, the wooden carving is one of the first pieces where Hepworth incorporated strings, making it a significant acquisition for the gallery.</p>

          <p>After entering the workforce during the pandemic's remote-work era, many members of Generation Z are actively seeking out in-person events to build social and professional networks. Fatigued by virtual interactions, they are participating in organized activities ranging from dumpling-making classes to pub quizzes, often sponsored by employers or community groups. This trend reflects a broader pushback against a digital-first culture and addresses a reported loneliness epidemic among young people. For many, these structured, activity-based events provide a less awkward way to form meaningful connections than random or purely digital encounters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the United States has experienced significant collapses in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown to a record high, solidifying its status as the world's top producer of apiary goods. According to Chinese researchers, the key difference lies in management practices. The US model often involves large-scale, clustered operations with thousands of hives and minimal intervention, making colonies more vulnerable. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping typically involves smaller, more intensively managed apiaries, which may contribute to better bee health and resilience.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent meeting with President Trump at the White House appeared far less confrontational than their previous encounter, with Zelenskyy successfully navigating the delicate diplomacy. While major differences remain, particularly on the necessity of a ceasefire before peace talks, the discussions focused on potential U.S. security guarantees and the prospect of a direct meeting with Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy presented a map to Trump to counter claims of Russian territorial gains, which reportedly improved the mood of the talks. The primary outcome seems to be that Ukraine has bought more time without any catastrophic diplomatic breakdowns.</p>

          <p>Japanese investment firm SoftBank is set to purchase a $2 billion stake in Intel, a move that caused the U.S. chipmaker's shares to rise over 5% in after-hours trading.

The announcement comes amid reports that the Trump administration is also considering taking an equity stake in the company to support its domestic production goals. The dual investment interests from private and public sectors highlight the strategic importance of strengthening the U.S. semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. In the last five years alone, these exports have grown by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. Chinese firms are increasingly redirecting trade and investment toward developing nations in response to U.S. tariffs and a domestic economic slowdown. This trend suggests a potential reordering of global commerce, with "South-South" trade becoming a new center of gravity. (not investment advice)</p>
