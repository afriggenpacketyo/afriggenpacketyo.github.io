          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as Operation Valkyrie, is being commemorated. The attempt, led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, failed when a bomb he planted in a briefcase did not kill the dictator, leading to the execution of about 200 conspirators. While the plotters were initially seen as traitors, their legacy has evolved, and they are now largely viewed as heroes of the German resistance. However, historians note the conspirators' complex motivations, which were tied to Germany's looming military defeat rather than purely democratic ideals.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United's Marcus Rashford Reportedly Reaches Agreement in Principle for Barcelona Move</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 14:30:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has reportedly reached a verbal agreement in principle for a loan move to Barcelona, with an option to buy. The 27-year-old has expressed a desire for a new challenge and has been training separately from the main squad amid a standoff over his future. For Manchester United, the transfer would provide significant wage bill savings, aiding their efforts to fund new signings. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for Rashford, who himself has spoken positively about playing for the Spanish club.</p>

          <p>According to a regulatory filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, under which Huang can sell up to 6 million shares. The transaction follows a separate sale of about $37 million worth of shares earlier in the week. Nvidia's stock has surged due to high demand for its AI-powering chips, pushing its market capitalization beyond $4 trillion and making it the world's most valuable company.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a 27-19 victory over Australia in their first Test, driven by a powerful performance from flanker Tom Curry. Coach Andy Farrell described Curry's contribution as "immense," as he set a physical tone from the start and scored a try. After the match, Curry gave a notably terse and stoic interview, seemingly responding to prior criticism of his form. His dominant play, alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, was a key factor in the Lions' win, though the team's performance dipped after he was substituted.</p>

          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A for its inconsistent approach to slow play during the third round of the Open Championship. Both golfers' groups were warned for their pace, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday after earlier rounds ran an hour over. DeChambeau argued for a more modern and fair system, suggesting that every player's shot should be timed individually throughout the entire round.</p>

          <p>A feature in The Guardian examines Generation Life, a group of young Christian activists promoting chastity before marriage to their peers at the Jersey shore. The article delves into their methods, which often focus on broader themes of self-worth and the negative impacts of social media on relationships, rather than directly on sexual abstinence. It places their mission within the context of Gen Z's so-called "sex recession" and the generation's noted risk aversion. The author reflects on the group's message of avoiding pain versus the personal growth that can come from vulnerability and heartbreak.</p>

Muncy, who was injured in early July, has already begun running and swinging a bat, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting his return could be "a lot sooner than anticipated." The slugger's absence has been deeply felt, as the Dodgers' offense has struggled, averaging less than three runs per game since he was sidelined. Muncy expressed relief that the injury was not more severe and is confident it will not significantly impact his swing upon his return.</p>

          <p>An early trend in the Q2 earnings season shows that initial negative market reactions to company reports may be short-lived. For example, shares of Wells Fargo and BlackRock initially fell after their earnings releases but quickly recovered as investors looked beyond headline misses to underlying strengths, such as fee growth or transformative acquisitions. This suggests a market that is willing to dig deeper into corporate results. The analysis also notes that while the impact of tariffs on inflation appears manageable for now, it remains a key factor to watch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway claims that "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead, he advocates for finding something you are good at and identifying where that talent can be lucrative. This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach, who advises young people to find the intersection of their passion, their skills, and what the world values. The key to success, according to Galloway, is not blindly following a passion but enduring rejection and embracing opportunities to pivot toward your strengths.</p>
