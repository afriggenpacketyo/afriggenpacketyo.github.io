          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in New York to discuss a potential $10 billion investment by the company to build a major data center in Brazil. The proposed project, located in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex in Ceará, would be one of the largest technology infrastructure investments in the country's history. This development aims to leverage Ceará's strategic position as a hub for transatlantic data cables connecting South America with North America, Europe, and Africa.

          <p>Disney announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, nearly a week after its indefinite suspension. The company stated the initial decision was made to avoid inflaming tensions following Kimmel's comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. The reinstatement comes after discussions between Disney executives and Kimmel, and amid significant public outcry from entertainers and civil liberties groups who framed the suspension as a threat to free speech. The host is expected to address the controversy upon his return to the late-night show.</p>
