          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's handling of numerous emergency appeals, stating that as presidents increasingly use executive orders, courts must respond. Speaking at a judicial conference, he noted that the court has increased its process for these cases, sometimes scheduling emergency oral arguments to ensure proper review. Kavanaugh also commented on the strong collegiality among the justices, saying that even in disagreement, they are patriots engaging thoughtfully on difficult issues. He emphasized that criticism is an expected part of the job for a judge, similar to a referee in sports.</p>

          <p>Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley has officially launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, a week after receiving a strong endorsement from former President Donald Trump. His entry sets up a high-stakes battle against former two-term Democratic Governor Roy Cooper for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. The race is expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive in the 2026 election cycle, with Democrats seeing an opportunity to flip a key seat in the battleground state. Cooper's campaign has already reported significant early fundraising success.</p>

          <p>After years of discussion, the Trump administration is proceeding with a plan to build a new grand ballroom at the White House, with construction set to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by President Trump himself along with other private donors. The new ballroom will be located in the East Wing and is designed to seat 650 guests, providing a much larger indoor event space than the current East Room. President Trump has long advocated for a permanent ballroom to replace the large tents often used for state dinners.</p>

          <p>United Talent Agency (UTA) and Michael Kassan, the founder of strategic advisory firm MediaLink, have agreed to end their legal battle. The dispute arose from UTA's $125 million acquisition of MediaLink in 2021, with both parties later accusing each other of breaching their contract. UTA had alleged excessive spending by Kassan, while Kassan claimed UTA failed to honor the terms of the deal. In a joint statement, representatives for both sides confirmed they have amicably resolved their dispute, though the specific terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched "Project Crypto," a new initiative aimed at modernizing financial regulations to accommodate crypto-based trading and blockchain technology. SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated the goal is to update antiquated rules to allow for the potential of on-chain software systems in U.S. securities markets. The project aligns with the administration's vision of making America a global crypto capital by fostering innovation and creating efficient licensing structures, rather than driving companies offshore with burdensome regulations.

          <h2>Researchers Discover Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor Through Hybridization</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved the long-standing mystery of the potato's origin, revealing that it evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers found that the modern potato was created through a hybridization event between this ancient tomato and a wild, non-tuber-producing species from Chile. A key gene from the tomato parent signaled the plant to form starch-rich tubers, while a gene from the other parent helped control their growth. This discovery demonstrates how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits.</p>

          <p>With protein's popularity on the rise, many food products are now fortified with the nutrient, but a registered dietitian suggests these may be unnecessary for most people. While protein is vital for functions like muscle growth and repair, many fortified foods like cereals and chips can also be high in added sugar, salt, or fat. The article advises consumers to read nutrition labels carefully and prioritize whole-food protein sources such as yogurt, legumes, eggs, and nuts. These natural sources provide a better overall nutrient profile compared to many processed, protein-enhanced alternatives.</p>

          <p>A key consumer protection for federally-backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," offers a significant benefit to the heirs of a homeowner. This rule stipulates that if heirs wish to keep the property after the borrower passes away or moves out, they only have to repay either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever amount is less. This ensures that family members will not be forced to pay more than the home is worth, even if the loan balance has grown larger than the property's value over time.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting booked in four separate matches to improperly affect betting markets, charges that could have resulted in a lifetime ban. While the four main charges were found "not proven," the commission did find Paqueta guilty of two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. The verdict vindicates the player, who had maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal.</p>
