          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal messaging app during a Cabinet meeting, just a day before President Trump announced his replacement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed conversations with individuals including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. This incident follows previous scrutiny of Waltz's use of Signal, including accidentally inviting a journalist to a group chat discussing a potential U.S. attack. Despite the administration's stance that Signal is approved, the Pentagon's watchdog has criticized the use of such apps for official communication.</p>
