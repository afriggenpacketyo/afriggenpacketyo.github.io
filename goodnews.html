          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., for reelection, praising him as an "America First Patriot." Trump had previously endorsed Hamadeh ahead of the 2024 GOP primary in Arizona's 8th Congressional District. Hamadeh recently introduced a resolution to limit the types of flags displayed in House facilities, allowing only the American flag, state flags, and flags of visiting foreign dignitaries. This endorsement and Hamadeh's legislative efforts align with Trump's broader political agenda. The endorsement signals strong support for Hamadeh within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Amid increased immigration enforcement raids, experts recommend that foreign-born residents, particularly undocumented immigrants, take steps to protect their financial assets. Key steps include collecting and securing important documents, checking access to accounts, establishing a power of attorney, and protecting finances for future generations. Organizations like the Appleseed Network and the Financial Planning Association offer resources and assistance to help families prepare for potential detention or deportation. Planning ahead can help ensure that assets are managed effectively and that loved ones are protected in worst-case scenarios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing challenges and criticisms, California remains committed to its high-speed rail project, driven by issues such as traffic congestion, housing shortages, and climate change. The project aims to connect major urban centers, stimulate economic development in the Central Valley, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While facing budget overruns and delays, proponents argue that the long-term benefits, including time savings and reduced highway construction costs, justify the effort. The author suggests considering a National Infrastructure Bank to finance such projects and emphasizes California's history of innovation and determination in overcoming obstacles.</p>

          <p>Assisted stretching is gaining popularity, leading to a proliferation of studios offering one-on-one sessions with stretch therapists, also known as "flexologists." These practitioners focus on increasing flexibility and mobility through techniques like PNF stretching, though they do not diagnose or treat injuries. While experts say assisted stretching can offer benefits like increased range of motion and stress relief, consistency is key, and it may not be a cure-all. The trend reflects a growing emphasis on recovery in fitness and a desire for personalized care, though the cost can be a barrier for some.</p>

          <p>Prestige television shows are increasingly employing the "oner," or one-shot technique, to enhance storytelling and create immersive experiences. Shows like "True Detective" and "The Bear" have used oners to great effect, and Emmy contenders this year are pushing the technique further with grueling fight scenes, trippy mind warps, and documentary-style realism. Technological advancements and skilled direction are making oners more accessible, but the key to success is ensuring the style serves the story rather than overshadowing it. The use of oners reflects a trend toward more ambitious and visually dynamic television production.</p>
