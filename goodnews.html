        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The USC Trojans secured a significant 33-17 road victory against Purdue, breaking a 14-game losing streak in the Eastern and Central time zones and overcoming a three-hour lightning delay. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was instrumental, tallying 282 passing yards and a rushing touchdown, contributing to the team's impressive 460 yards of total offense. Despite a fourth-quarter field goal miss that could have invoked past anxieties from similar collapses, safety Bishop Fitzgerald's second interception of the night ultimately secured the win. This hard-fought triumph is seen as a crucial exorcism of past road demons and a strong start to USC's Big Ten conference play, demonstrating resilience under challenging circumstances.</p>

          <p>The first group of critically ill and injured Palestinian children has successfully departed Gaza and is anticipated to arrive in the UK within days to receive vital NHS medical treatment. This significant humanitarian initiative, coordinated by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Home Office, and Department of Health, represents the UK government's inaugural direct evacuation effort for children during the ongoing conflict. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the development, noting the group is believed to consist of 30 to 50 children, with provisions for accompanying family members. This evacuation provides a glimmer of hope amidst the severe strain on Gaza's health system and the continuing reports of malnutrition-related fatalities in the territory, highlighting international efforts to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, a landmark proposal to ban PFAS "forever chemicals" from cookware, cleaning products, and various other household items, heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk. These chemicals, used for decades due to heat and water resistance, are linked to severe health issues and persist in the environment and human body. The legislation has drawn opposition from celebrity chefs and cookware manufacturers who argue certain PFAS types are safe, while environmental groups and advocates like Mark Ruffalo emphasize health risks from daily use and degradation. This move positions California at the forefront of regulating these ubiquitous substances, prioritizing public health over industry concerns.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 237, a last-minute package designed to stabilize crude-oil refineries by allowing 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley while simultaneously tightening restrictions on offshore drilling. This deal, brokered by Governor Newsom and legislative leaders, aims to address concerns about gas prices and refinery closures, which could reduce state capacity by 20%. While framed as a necessary short-term measure for energy market stability and job preservation, environmentalists and progressive Democrats criticize it as a "regulatory giveaway" to Big Oil. The legislation also extends the cap-and-trade program and seeks participation in a regional electricity market, balancing immediate economic needs with long-term climate goals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) to expedite the development and deployment of electric air taxis, aiming to secure U.S. leadership in advanced airspace technology. Led by the FAA, the three-year program will create new regulatory frameworks and foster partnerships with private companies and local governments. It will include at least five pilot projects for both piloted and unmanned eVTOL operations, focusing on cargo delivery, medical transport, and emergency services. This initiative allows for testing before full FAA certification, with companies like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation already announcing their participation, signaling a push for future aerial mobility.</p>

Additionally, the planned Rio Indo dam and tunnel project will augment Lake Gatun's water supply, crucial for lock operations. These multi-billion dollar efforts, though not fully complete before the next El Niño, underscore the canal's proactive engineering response to climate change impacts and its importance for the U.S. economy.</p>
