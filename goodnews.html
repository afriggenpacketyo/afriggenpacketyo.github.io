          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has announced it will permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022, respectively, following fatal crashes and production defects, placing certification solely in the FAA's hands. The decision signals renewed regulatory confidence in Boeing's manufacturing quality, though the FAA will still alternate certification duties with the company and maintain increased oversight on production rates.</p>

In its statement, Sinclair cited feedback from various community stakeholders and underscored the importance of responsible broadcasting, while also noting that its proposals for a network ombudsman have not yet been adopted by ABC and Disney.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup began with a surge of American energy, as Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas secured an early lead, electrifying the massive home crowd at Bethpage Black. However, the initial momentum quickly faded as the European team mounted a formidable comeback across all matches. Europe's players demonstrated steady precision, silencing the partisan crowd and winning three of the four morning foursome matches to take a commanding 3-1 lead, spoiling the Americans' planned party.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly payments for a new $150,000 home equity loan have decreased slightly compared to earlier in the year. For a 10-year term, the average monthly cost is now approximately $1,847, while a 15-year term averages around $1,452. The article breaks down these costs, noting that while the savings are modest on a monthly basis, they can accumulate to over a thousand dollars over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

This slight underperformance, along with a minor dip in membership renewal rates, caused the company's stock to decline. However, many analysts remain optimistic, highlighting strong membership fee growth and the company's consistent ability to gain market share in a challenging retail environment.

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a collection of over 28,000 fossils, including the historically significant "Java Man" bones, to Indonesia. These fossils, discovered in the 1890s by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois during the colonial era, are among the first known remains of Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from an independent committee which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population, marking another step in the Netherlands' efforts to reckon with its colonial past.</p>

          <p>Following historic flooding in August, We Energies has completed a major restoration effort, replacing over 1,100 natural gas meters that were submerged and damaged. The company reported that the meters, located in several neighborhoods across Milwaukee, West Allis, and Wauwatosa, posed a safety risk from trapped debris and potential corrosion. In the immediate aftermath of the severe weather, electric crews also worked around the clock to restore power to more than 150,000 customers in a four-day period.</p>

          <p>A retirement strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of a retiree's savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending, aiming to create a balance between financial security and liquidity throughout retirement.
