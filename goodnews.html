          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie stated that justice cannot be avoided to prevent embarrassment for powerful individuals implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein case. He and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing the files through a discharge petition. Khanna expressed confidence they will have the necessary 218 signatures by the end of September to bring the legislation to the House floor. This legislative push aims to ensure accountability for anyone involved, regardless of their status or influence.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to create online resources documenting Catholic miracles, spreading his faith through digital media. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV, recognized Acutis for his devout faith and kindness, which included defending bullied children and aiding the homeless. His preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, has become a major pilgrimage site in Assisi.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris, who had been running in second place for most of the race, fell behind his teammate Oscar Piastri after a slow pit stop. McLaren then ordered Piastri, the championship leader, to let Norris pass, a decision that Piastri publicly disagreed with but ultimately followed. The team defended the move, comparing it to a previous tactical swap, but it has sparked debate about fairness in the tight title race.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of adults in their 30s and 40s are experiencing knee pain, a problem traditionally associated with aging. Medical experts attribute this trend to two primary factors: a higher average body mass index (BMI) and a rise in injuries from high-intensity sports during high school and college. A recent study found that early structural damage in the knees is common by age 30, often without symptoms, with higher BMI being the main contributing factor. To prevent pain, doctors recommend maintaining a healthy weight, strengthening surrounding muscles, and seeking orthopedic care if discomfort persists.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vonda Wright, a 58-year-old surgeon and longevity expert, advocates for a diet centered on clean, whole foods to promote a long and healthy life. She focuses on consuming one gram of protein per pound of body weight, aiming for 130 grams daily to build and maintain muscle mass. Her diet prioritizes green leafy vegetables like kale, dairy, eggs, and animal meat, while strictly avoiding sugar and simple carbohydrates, which she says cause inflammation and mental "dullness." The only exception she makes is for homemade sourdough bread, which she freezes to lower its glycemic index.</p>

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who has repeatedly been spotted driving a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car on a public motorway since 2019. The driver was tracked to his home after the most recent sighting and was taken into custody while still wearing his racing suit and helmet. Previous attempts to identify the driver failed because he always wore a helmet, preventing police from taking action. The vehicle is believed to be a Dallara GP2 racing car, and the owner now faces fines for driving it on public roads.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, who served as Germany's foreign minister until May, has begun her new role as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, in a move seen as a reaction to her staunch criticism of the war in Ukraine. In her year-long term, Baerbock will chair UN meetings and help prepare for the next Secretary-General election. Her appointment has drawn some criticism in Germany, with political opponents like Chancellor Friedrich Merz taking issue with her polarizing diplomatic style.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a kayak made entirely from mushrooms across 26.4 miles of open ocean, from Catalina Island to the California mainland. The vessel was grown from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi, cultivated on a hemp substrate inside a kayak-shaped mold. The 12-hour journey aims to demonstrate the potential of this biodegradable material, known as AquaFung, as a sustainable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation. Shoemaker's achievement is the second water-tested mushroom boat ever made and the longest open-water voyage for such a craft.</p>

To continue receiving benefits without interruption, these individuals must enroll in direct deposit to a bank account or sign up for a Direct Express prepaid debit card.

While the American team will be disappointed, the tournament showcased the emergence of promising young talent, such as 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa.

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," is one of the most important things parents can do for their newborn's development. Consistent, deep sleep is crucial for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional growth and is linked to better cognitive function and emotional regulation later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and maintaining a flexible routine. He emphasizes that these foundational habits are easiest to instill in infancy and contribute to long-term well-being.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that individuals preparing for societal collapse, often associated with right-wing politics, should embrace solar energy. Despite political affiliations with fossil fuels, solar power offers unparalleled self-sufficiency and resilience, aligning with conservative ideals of individualism and independence. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex supply chains, solar panels provide a durable, long-term energy source with simple maintenance, requiring only sunlight. The author suggests that this practical advantage should transcend political divides, making solar panels a logical choice for anyone concerned with personal preparedness in a crisis.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece posits that China's simultaneous expansion of both coal and renewable energy is a pragmatic strategy, not a climate policy reversal. As the country adds record amounts of solar and wind power, existing grid infrastructure struggles to handle the intermittent supply, leading to increased "curtailment" where clean energy is wasted. New coal plants are being used as a flexible backup or "shock absorber" to ensure grid stability, especially during peak demand and when hydropower is low. This approach allows grid operators to confidently approve more renewables without risking blackouts during the transition.</p>

In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, created a basic website for her to sell her unwanted items, quickly realizing that many others faced the same issue. The platform grew organically through word of mouth and expanded internationally, becoming a major player in the second-hand fashion market. Despite early struggles, Vinted became Lithuania's first tech "unicorn" and now has over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>
