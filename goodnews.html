          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris delivered a stunning performance to claim pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by more than half a second. Norris described his qualifying lap at the Red Bull Ring as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, signaling a return to form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The result was aided by recent car upgrades that improved his feeling with the vehicle. His teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, will start in third, while rival Max Verstappen had a difficult session, qualifying in seventh.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential issue with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding sufficient pressure during deployment in certain crashes. The company stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and, if necessary, replace the side curtain airbags at no cost to the owners.</p>

England's response faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's 66 being the only significant resistance. The result marks England's heaviest-ever T20 defeat by runs and sets a challenging tone for the series.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people, with organizers estimating up to 200,000, participated in the Budapest Pride march in a powerful act of defiance against a government ban. The event proceeded after Budapest's mayor declared it a municipal event, bypassing a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. The march has become a symbol of resistance against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government and its broader crackdown on civil liberties. The event drew significant international support, with dozens of European Parliament members and diplomats in attendance to show solidarity.</p>

This initiative will also apply to foods sold to K-12 schools, with a target date of the 2026-2027 school year. While many of its popular products like Uncrustables are already free of synthetic dyes, the change will affect items such as sugar-free jams and some Hostess brand snacks. This move aligns Smucker with other major food companies like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have recently made similar pledges amid increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their tour of Australia with a convincing victory over the Western Force in Perth, but the win was tempered by an injury concern. Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a tight hamstring, potentially requiring a replacement to be called up. Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking intent but noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a major positive, as the team now prepares for its next match in Brisbane.</p>

          <p>Lockheed Martin, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, has successfully completed a critical flight test of its Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR). The test, conducted over the Pacific Ocean, demonstrated the system's ability to detect, track, and differentiate a live ballistic missile target from countermeasures and other clutter. This event marked a significant milestone, as it was the first time the LRDR's full discrimination capabilities were proven in a live, complex environment. The data was also used to simulate a successful missile defense engagement. (not investment advice)</p>
