          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's economic policies, likening them to those of former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Farage's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown, increasing mortgage costs for families. Reform UK's proposals include tax breaks for married couples and scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which economists have questioned regarding their financial feasibility. A Reform spokesperson dismissed Starmer's comments as a "desperate attack" from a party trailing in the polls. (not investment advice)</p>

The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade of DeepSeek R1 was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics. DeepSeek's advancements highlight China's ongoing development in AI despite U.S. restrictions on chip access.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining strength. The White House has criticized the ruling and has lodged an appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York has blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world. The court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs. The decision blocks tariffs Trump imposed on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies on China, Mexico, and Canada. Wendy Cutler from the Asia Society Policy Institute suggests this ruling may cause partners to hold off on making concessions during trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10 percent increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of anticipated negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also increased, reaching an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the cost of the tariffs to consumers, analysts believe the company will face pressure to do so if the levies remain long-term. For the full business year, Toyota expects a drop in net profit due to tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>
