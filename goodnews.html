          <p>Manchester United is scaling back celebrations and ticket allocations for the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur due to cost-cutting measures. The club will host a barbeque at the Carrington training ground if they win, but a parade is not planned. Players are limited to two free tickets each, with additional tickets available for purchase but without organized travel assistance. This decision follows redundancies and the removal of free lunches for staff as part of the club's efforts to manage expenses, and the club says they are committed to ensuring as many tickets as possible from the club's official 15,000 allocation go to supporters.</p>

          <p>The Chinese AI agent Manus AI, known for its ability to handle complex tasks, has opened its platform for public registration, eliminating its previous invite-only system.

          <p>Financial technology firms that benefited from interest rate hikes in 2022 are now facing a resilience test as interest rates decline. Higher rates boosted net interest income for fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo, but a broad decline in rates raises doubts about the sustainability of relying on this income. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. Falling rates may expose vulnerabilities in some fintechs, while others with broader income strategies may adapt and endure.</p>
