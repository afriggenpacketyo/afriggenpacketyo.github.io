          <h2>Court Ruling Affirms Separation of Powers in Tariff Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 09:41:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs is being hailed as a victory for the constitutional separation of powers. The case, filed by the Liberty Justice Center, challenged Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports from almost every nation. The court ruled that the IEEPA does not grant the president unlimited tariff authority, emphasizing that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce. The decision imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the tariffs, though the administration has appealed the ruling. The ruling underscores the importance of preventing the president from wielding unchecked authority and initiating trade wars.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its childhood immunization schedule, stating that healthy children "may receive" COVID-19 vaccines, replacing the previous broad recommendation. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about removing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women, although the CDC website still recommends vaccination for pregnant women. The agency continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and all adults, and the change reflects a move towards "shared clinical decision-making." Health insurance companies will still be required to cover the shots for this age group, and the CDC has removed a statement that the guidance was backed by outside medical groups. The updated guidance reflects ongoing discussions about narrowing recommendations to specific age groups and risk factors.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up last year. Zaki, the favorite entering the bee, maintained a joyful approach throughout the competition, but nearly lost after misspelling "commelina" due to overconfidence. Despite the misstep, he recovered and correctly spelled "eclaircissement" to win the title. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki is remembered for both his correct and incorrect spellings. He plans to donate a portion of his winnings to charity.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of hiring managers indicates that employees with master's degrees may not perform better than those with bachelor's degrees and relevant experience. Despite this, 72% of hiring managers still offer higher salaries to candidates with master's degrees, with some offering salary increases of up to 20%. The perception remains that a master's degree signifies drive, discipline, and commitment, though employers increasingly recognize that experience can demonstrate similar qualities. Skills-based hiring is becoming more common, with some companies prioritizing work experience over degrees, and Gen Z hiring managers are more likely to view master's degree holders as stronger performers.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages following a libel case against the BBC. The case stemmed from a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and accompanying online article that alleged Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, an allegation Adams denies. The court found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable.

Preparing the soil with proper pH levels and adding organic matter is crucial, as is providing adequate space for the plants to grow. Protecting plants from pests and harsh weather, staking or trellising, mulching to retain water, and fertilizing with organic sources like compost tea can also accelerate growth. Timely harvesting is essential to encourage further fruit production.</p>

Gauguin's life was marked by dramatic events, including a childhood in Peru, a career as a stockbroker, and his eventual pursuit of art in Brittany and Tahiti. His art, characterized by bold colors and simplified forms, challenged traditional European aesthetics and paved the way for modern art movements.

          <p>Savings account interest rates remain high, with high-yield savings accounts offering significantly better returns than traditional accounts. The national average savings account interest rate is 0.42%, but top high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Online banks often provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs. Choosing a high-yield savings account and comparing different options can help individuals maximize their savings.</p>

          <p>The price of gold is currently $3,307.21 per ounce, but this figure is subject to constant fluctuations due to various market factors. Supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, and central bank policies all influence gold prices. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty and a hedge against inflation. Investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor these factors to make informed decisions regarding their gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brood XIV of the cicada is emerging from underground in parts of the U.S., including Kentucky and Tennessee, in a one-in-17-year event. These insects are not dangerous to pets or humans and do not sting or bite. Cicadas are beneficial to the ecosystem, serving as a food source for birds and aerating the soil. While billions are expected, the numbers are lower than last year due to only one brood emerging this spring.</p>

The company's leaders discussed challenges and higher costs associated with tariffs during an earnings call. Despite these concerns, Costco's competitive prices, bulk discounts, and discounted gas and groceries could attract more customers and encourage membership renewals. The company has been working to reduce tariff costs by rushing orders, rerouting goods, and sourcing more private-label items in different regions. (not investment advice)</p>
