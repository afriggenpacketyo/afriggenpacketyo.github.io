          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers are preparing for a holiday shopping season marked by more price-conscious consumers. Companies like Kohl's are launching marketing campaigns and deals earlier than usual to capture spending from shoppers who are making more frequent trips but with smaller basket sizes. Executives note that consumers are increasingly savvy, closely monitoring for the best prices and sometimes trading down from premium to private-label brands. Despite concerns about inflation and potential tariffs, retailers report having normal inventory levels and are cautiously optimistic about the season.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has won a historic by-election victory in the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) seat of Caerphilly, a constituency held by the Labour Party for over a century. Plaid's candidate, Lindsay Whittle, secured 47% of the vote, defeating Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which came in second, while Labour finished a distant third. The result represents a significant blow to Labour, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer acknowledging the party needs to do more. Plaid Cymru's leader hailed the win as momentous, suggesting the party can now win in any part of Wales.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 12:51:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in 2025, a significant IRS rule change will affect beneficiaries of inherited IRAs, potentially triggering penalties up to 25% if ignored. Many non-spouse heirs, such as adult children, who inherited an IRA from someone who had reached the age for required minimum distributions (RMDs), must now take annual RMDs themselves. This is in addition to the existing "10-year rule," which mandates the account be fully depleted by the tenth year after the original owner's death. Financial experts advise heirs to plan withdrawals carefully to manage tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI company Anthropic and Google have formalized a massive cloud partnership, giving Anthropic access to as many as one million of Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The deal, worth tens of billions of dollars, is Google's largest TPU commitment to date and will significantly expand Anthropic's AI computing capacity. This move supports Anthropic's multi-cloud strategy, which also utilizes Amazon's Trainium chips and Nvidia's GPUs to optimize performance and cost for its Claude AI models. The expansion is driven by Anthropic's rapid business growth, with its annual revenue run rate now approaching $7 billion.</p>

          <p>Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is reviving the debate within the European Union to permanently end the biannual changing of clocks for daylight saving time (DST). Sanchez argued in a social media post that the practice no longer makes sense, offering minimal energy savings while negatively affecting public health. The European Commission previously found that 85% of Europeans oppose DST in a 2018 survey, but a consensus on whether to permanently adopt summer or winter time has stalled progress. An EU Commissioner confirmed that a new detailed study is underway to support a final decision on the matter.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Gold's Volatility: What Investors Should Understand About Its Link to Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 12:39:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent volatility in gold prices, which saw a sharp drop from a record high before partially recovering, has left many investors uncertain. The article explains that while gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, their relationship is complex and not always direct. Gold prices are influenced by multiple factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates, and overall investor sentiment. Experts suggest that what truly matters are real yields—interest rates adjusted for inflation—as lower real yields make non-interest-bearing gold more attractive. Investors are advised to view gold as a diversification tool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven weeks after preorders began, Apple is still struggling to meet the high demand for its new iPhone 17 lineup, particularly the standard model. Unlike previous years where Pro models were the hardest to get, the base iPhone 17 has proven to be a massive hit, with shipping times holding at 2-3 weeks in major markets like the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is also sold out in some regions, while the iPhone Air model is reportedly selling poorly outside of China. These supply constraints align with analyst reports indicating strong consumer interest in the standard and Pro Max versions.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for September showed a 0.3% monthly increase, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.0%, slightly below economists' expectations. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.2% for the month. A significant 4.1% jump in gasoline prices was a major contributor to the headline figure, but other inflationary pressures appeared more subdued. This long-awaited report, the only economic data released during the government shutdown, is seen as reinforcing the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

He revealed that conversations with his family and manager Ruben Amorim reinforced his decision to stay, as he feels he has not yet accomplished all his goals.
