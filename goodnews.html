          <p>Paxos, the blockchain firm partnered with PayPal, erroneously created $300 trillion worth of the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin due to a technical glitch during an internal transfer. The company quickly identified the mistake and burned the excess tokens within approximately 20 minutes, assuring the public that no security breach occurred and customer funds remained safe. This incident highlights the operational risks in the digital currency space, as the mistakenly minted amount was more than double the world's estimated total GDP. The event occurred as stablecoins are gaining wider adoption by mainstream financial platforms.</p>

The motion, which was brought forward by the far-left France Unbowed party, failed to secure the necessary 289 votes for passage, ultimately receiving 271. Lecornu garnered crucial support from the Socialist Party after pledging to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform, a key point of contention. A second no-confidence motion from the far-right National Rally is also anticipated but is not expected to succeed, solidifying the new government's position for now.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with net income surging 39.1% year-over-year to NT$452.3 billion, significantly exceeding market expectations. This impressive growth is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strengthening AI "mega trend," CEO C.C. Wei raised the company's 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. The company also increased its planned capital expenditure, signaling strong confidence in future demand and its market leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Natalie Grabow, an 80-year-old grandmother from New Jersey, has become the oldest woman ever to finish the grueling Ironman World Championship in Hawaii. She completed the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run in 16 hours, 45 minutes, and 26 seconds. Remarkably, Grabow only learned to swim at age 59 specifically to compete in triathlons, overcoming a significant personal hurdle to pursue the sport. Her achievement is being celebrated as an inspiration, demonstrating that it is never too late to take on new challenges.

          <p>Following a period of political upheaval that included a declaration of martial law, the South Korean government is emphasizing the strength and legitimacy of its democratic institutions. The article, an opinion piece from a South Korean perspective, asserts that the "Revolution of Light" and the subsequent peaceful election of President Lee Jae Myung reaffirmed the nation's commitment to democracy. It pushes back against what it calls misperceptions of fragility or authoritarianism, highlighting that legal proceedings against the former administration are being handled by independent prosecutors. The piece also stresses the renewed strength of the ROK-U.S. alliance under President Lee and President Trump.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has encouraged his French and Spanish counterparts to advocate for the European Union to maintain "genuine strategic autonomy" and adopt a "correct perception of China." In meetings held in Hangzhou, Wang emphasized that China and the EU should position themselves as partners. This diplomatic push occurs amid significant challenges in the relationship, including deep mistrust over China's stance on the war in Ukraine, a massive trade deficit favoring China, and ongoing trade frictions that have resulted in tariffs from both sides. Wang's discussions are part of a broader engagement with key EU member states.</p>

          <p>The Bradford Bulls will be promoted back to the top-tier Super League for the 2026 season after an 11-year absence, following the latest club grading announcements. Under a new system managed by IMG, Bradford achieved a high Grade B status, ranking 10th overall and surpassing several current Super League teams. Their promotion comes at the expense of the Salford Red Devils, who received a lower grade and will be relegated from the league. This marks a significant turnaround for the Bulls, a once-dominant club that has faced severe financial difficulties, including a period in the third tier of rugby league.</p>

          <p>The article examines several current topics in international football, questioning if Italy could miss a third consecutive World Cup. Despite winning Euro 2020, the national team is in a tight qualification race, reflecting a deeper issue with producing elite-level talent compared to past generations. The analysis also explores why Florian Wirtz, Liverpool's record $155 million signing, has had a disappointing start, noting that while he has yet to score or assist, underlying statistics show he is creating chances for his teammates. Finally, it notes recent improved performances by the U.S. Men's National Team under coach Mauricio Pochettino after a difficult first year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying a process of programmed cell death, which could lead to new treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. The process involves special "death fold" proteins that, upon detecting a threat like a virus, trigger a chain reaction that causes the cell to self-destruct. Scientists at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research have found this process is powered by a rapid crystallization similar to that in reusable hand warmers. It is theorized that this mechanism may be needlessly killing brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases, and manipulating it could help keep those cells alive or, conversely, induce death in cancer cells.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of making public bus services free is gaining traction in cities like New York, but the idea has divided transit advocates and shown mixed results elsewhere. Proponents, including NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, argue that fare-free transit increases accessibility, speeds up boarding times, and encourages more people to use public transport instead of cars. However, skeptics and some research suggest that riders prioritize service frequency and reliability over cost. Cities like Kansas City, which experimented with free fares, faced challenges with sustainable funding and security, ultimately deciding to reinstate fares, offering a cautionary tale for larger systems considering the policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. health insurance premiums continue their steep rise, a small but notable number of companies are opting to absorb the full cost for their employees. While the average family premium for employer-based plans now exceeds $25,500 annually, firms like Boston Consulting Group and the startup Bartesian are offering zero-premium plans, meaning no deductions are taken from employee paychecks for coverage. These employers view the significant investment as a strategic advantage for recruiting and retaining talent, as well as for maintaining a healthy and focused workforce. This approach provides a stark contrast to the broader trend of rising healthcare costs being passed on to workers.</p>

LVMH reported its first quarterly sales growth of the year, noting that Chinese consumption was "getting close to stabilization." The French company's CFO stated that sales in mainland China grew by mid to high-single digits in the third quarter, though spending by Chinese tourists abroad declined. While a full recovery is still pending due to the nation's property slump and high youth unemployment, these developments suggest a potential bottoming out of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling sided with two unions who argued the administration was unlawfully using the funding lapse to implement its plans to downsize the federal workforce. The judge cited public statements from President Trump and his budget chief as evidence of political motivations for the cuts, which were set to impact over 30 agencies. The administration, which had planned to cut over 10,000 jobs during the shutdown, is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled an ambitious action plan to double its electric vehicle (EV) charging capacity by 2027, aiming to support the needs of over 80 million EVs. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) outlined a goal to provide more than 300 million kilowatts of public charging capacity. The plan includes the installation of 1.6 million new fast chargers in urban areas and upgrading older, less efficient infrastructure. This major nationwide expansion is designed to address existing issues like uneven network layout and insufficient services, further solidifying China's commitment to its rapidly growing new-energy vehicle market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of research indicates that women not only sleep differently than men but may also need more rest, potentially up to 20 extra minutes per night. Biologically, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle significantly impact sleep quality and patterns. Social and structural factors also play a role, as women often bear a greater burden of domestic labor and non-traditional work shifts, leading to higher rates of exhaustion and sleep debt. Experts note that while women consistently sleep longer and deeper in lab settings, they also report insomnia symptoms twice as often as men, a trend that begins around puberty.</p>
