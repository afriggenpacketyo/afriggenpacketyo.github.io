        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece advocates for Eric Tung's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, portraying him as a crucial conservative appointment by President Trump. The author praises Tung’s exceptional credentials, including clerkships for Justices Gorsuch and Scalia, and his experience as a federal prosecutor. The article argues Tung is a committed constitutionalist whose confirmation is vital for the traditionally liberal court. It also decries what it calls partisan attacks on Tung during his confirmation hearing, suggesting Democratic senators focused on guilt-by-association tactics rather than his extensive qualifications and bipartisan support from legal peers.</p>

          <p>According to recent data, mortgage interest rates are showing unsteady movement, with the 30-year fixed rate decreasing slightly while the 15-year fixed rate has ticked up. The article notes that weak employment data from the July Jobs report has increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, which could lead to lower mortgage rates in the coming weeks. It provides a breakdown of current national average rates for various mortgage and refinancing products, including conventional and VA loans. The piece suggests that while it's a relatively better time to buy a house compared to recent years, high rates remain a significant factor for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 12,000-year-old Göbekli Tepe archaeological site in Turkey has become a focal point for conspiracy theories, amplified by figures like Graham Hancock and podcaster Joe Rogan. These theories suggest a lost, advanced civilization built the site, with some accusing archaeologists of deliberately hiding discoveries. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to protect the delicate site for future research, not to conceal information. The article highlights the tension between scientific methodology and the rapid spread of speculative narratives that risk overshadowing the genuine historical mystery of the ancient ceremonial hub.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 05:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a sign of easing tensions, North Korea has reportedly started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This action follows South Korea's decision in June, under the new administration of President Lee Jae Myung, to halt its own loudspeaker broadcasts of K-pop music and news reports. The move is seen as a reciprocal gesture aimed at reopening dialogue between the two nations, which have experienced heightened tensions in recent years. South Korea's military is continuing to monitor the situation to confirm the extent of the removal, as the two countries remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Šeško from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. The five-year contract includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3 million, with the rest in add-ons. Šeško, who was also a target for Newcastle United, is United's third major attacking signing, praised by the club for his rare combination of pace and physical dominance. His arrival at Old Trafford raises questions about the future of Danish striker Rasmus Højlund, who the club is reportedly willing to sell for around £30 million amid interest from AC Milan.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has revived a long-stalled plan to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland and become the world's longest single-span suspension bridge. The project, with an estimated cost of €13.5 billion, is slated to begin construction in 2026. First approved in 1971, the bridge has faced numerous cancellations due to financial and practical concerns, including its location in a seismically active zone. Proponents believe it will bring economic prosperity and create over 100,000 jobs, while opponents argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure and express environmental concerns.</p>

Etiquette expert Elaine Swann suggests keeping visits to a manageable length, ideally around four days, and communicating plans clearly to align expectations. Guests should be self-sufficient, especially regarding transportation, and avoid assuming the host's invitation to "make yourself at home" means they can treat the space as their own.

          <p>Europe is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to a report from the European Travel Commission (ETC), Chinese tourists are showing a strong preference for long-haul travel to the continent over other destinations like the U.S. and Japan. This trend is expected to continue, with some analysts suggesting that ongoing political and trade tensions between the United States and China may be redirecting Chinese travelers toward Europe. The influx is a welcome boost for the European tourism industry, which is seeing a strong recovery in this key market.</p>
