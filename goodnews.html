          <p>Spanish and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has been awarded the women's Ballon d'Or for an unprecedented third time, cementing her status as a dominant force in world football. The 27-year-old secured the prestigious prize ahead of her international teammate Mariona Caldentey, with several English players also placing in the top 10. This victory continues a five-year streak of Barcelona players winning the award, following Alexia Putellas's wins in 2021 and 2022. Bonmati's win comes after a remarkable season where she overcame viral meningitis to lead Spain to the Euro 2025 final and win a domestic treble with her club.</p>

          <p>The iconic Reel Inn seafood shack, destroyed in a fire months ago, may have a chance to rebuild after California State Parks reversed its initial decision. The owners, Andy Leonard and Teddy Seraphine-Leonard, were originally told they could not rebuild on the state-owned land and could only bid to operate a temporary food truck nearby. Following public outcry, the state agency has now reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the owners to bring the beloved restaurant back. While a clear timeline has not been provided, this development offers a glimmer of hope for the return of the 40-year-old establishment, a cherished landmark for locals and tourists.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain forward Ousmane Dembélé has won the men's Ballon d'Or, capping a remarkable career transformation. Once plagued by injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, the 28-year-old thrived at PSG, scoring 35 goals and leading the club to a historic treble. His success was partly enabled by Kylian Mbappé's departure, which allowed Dembélé to take on a more central, goal-scoring role under manager Luis Enrique. The article credits personal changes, including his marriage and improved professionalism regarding nutrition and fitness, for helping him finally realize the potential that once made him one of the world's most expensive players.</p>

          <p>U.S. tech giant Nvidia has announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, involving an investment of up to $100 billion. Nvidia will supply high-performance chips to power the data centers for OpenAI's next-generation artificial intelligence infrastructure. The collaboration, described by Nvidia's CEO as the "next leap forward" in intelligence, aims to create the world's most advanced AI systems. This major investment comes as U.S. tech dominance in AI faces growing competition from China and as Nvidia navigates regulatory pressures from both the U.S. and Chinese governments over its chip sales.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume broadcasting on Tuesday, nearly a week after being suspended. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made regarding the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr. Disney stated the suspension was intended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," and the decision to return was made after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The suspension had prompted significant debate over free speech, with major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair also pulling the show from their affiliate stations.</p>

The collection will feature around 40 new styles that blend performance and lifestyle, incorporating Nike's drying technology with everyday knit pieces.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis, with its variable rate benefiting from the cooling rate climate. However, a home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed interest rate over the entire loan term, protecting borrowers from future rate hikes. This article advises homeowners to carefully weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term predictability of a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against Orsted's Revolution Wind farm, allowing the renewable energy company to resume construction. The Interior Department had ordered a halt to the nearly completed project off the coast of New England, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. Judge Royce Lamberth granted Orsted a temporary injunction, stating the company was likely to succeed in its lawsuit and would suffer irreparable harm if work remained stopped. The ruling represents a significant setback for President Trump's efforts to shut down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>
