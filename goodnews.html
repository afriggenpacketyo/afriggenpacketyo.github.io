          <p>Identity software maker Okta reported fiscal results that significantly exceeded Wall Street projections for its second quarter, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon noted that economic conditions were "much better than we thought," prompting the company to revise its fiscal 2026 forecast upwards and remove prior caution related to macroeconomic uncertainty. Okta is also strategically expanding its offerings by developing software for managing the identities of artificial intelligence agents and recently acquired Israeli startup Axiom Security. This robust performance and forward-looking strategy indicate strong momentum in the tech sector, positioning Okta for continued growth in a dynamic market environment.</p>

          <p>Speculation is high regarding whether gold prices will fall this September, following a dramatic surge over the past two years where prices rose 64%. The article suggests a potential decline if August inflation data is low, due to gold's inverse relationship with inflation, which could reduce the need for alternative assets.

This article explores the complex factors influencing gold's market behavior and offers investment considerations for both new and existing investors. (not investment advice)</p>
