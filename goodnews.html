          <p>Moderna has announced positive late-stage trial results for its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine, which demonstrated a superior immune response compared to a currently available shot. The successful trial paves the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination Covid-flu shot later this year. The company highlighted the need for more effective vaccines, citing the severity of the recent flu season. This development positions Moderna as a potential frontrunner in the race to market a combination respiratory vaccine.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that understanding dogs requires recognizing that smell is their primary sense. In an interview, she describes how dogs construct a spatial and temporal map of their world through olfaction, where scents provide information rather than just being categorized as good or bad. For a dog, a person's presence lingers as a fading scent long after they've left a room, effectively encoding the passage of time in smell. This fundamental difference in perception creates a delightful mystery in the human-canine relationship.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted by Chinese researchers has identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in the protein GLAST-1. The research, which analyzed the cochleae of monkeys at a single-cell level, found that this protein is crucial for maintaining hearing function. The scientists also discovered that the common diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of hearing loss in the monkeys.

Instead of clich√©d or humorous prints, experts suggest using sophisticated or personal art to create a focal point and distract from the room's utilitarian function. The article provides tips, such as using bold paintings, whimsical pieces, or even children's artwork to add personality. While moisture is a concern, well-ventilated spaces can house valuable pieces, and designers encourage thinking broadly about what constitutes art, from postcards to elegant sketches.</p>
