          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of Chinese tourism in Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels from 2019, but with a noticeable shift in travel habits. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, Chinese travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. This change is driven by travelers in their 30s and 40s, who prefer family trips over traditional group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its strategies to target this evolving market, including engaging on Chinese social media platforms. Despite a temporary dip in visitor numbers due to concerns about a manga predicting a major disaster, overall tourism from China continues to grow.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, indicated that talks with U.S. Cabinet members are progressing toward a potential tariff agreement, possibly by the following month. Following a meeting in Washington with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Akazawa stated plans for another negotiation round before the G7 summit in mid-June. Despite the progress, Akazawa emphasized Japan's unchanged stance to remove all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports, which remains a key condition for any agreement. The U.S. Treasury Department noted Bessent highlighted the importance of boosting investment and cooperation on economic security issues.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, intervened on a flight from Tokyo to Houston when a passenger allegedly tried to open an emergency exit door mid-flight. Armentrout noticed the man acting suspiciously and positioned himself between the man and the exit. When the man attempted to open another exit door, Armentrout subdued him with assistance from another passenger and flight attendants. The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the man was taken into custody for medical evaluation, and a second passenger was removed for punching a bathroom door due to frustration with the diversion.</p>

Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump announced plans to double steel import tariffs to 50% and claimed Nippon would invest $14 billion, creating jobs and modernizing facilities. While emphasizing that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, he did not specify the ownership structure.

Authorities warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for bee swarming. Bee experts and the local community are working to help the bees return to their hives and find their queen. Honeybees play a key role in pollination and food production, but they have been facing numerous threats and declining for years due to insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change, and lack of a diverse food supply.</p>
