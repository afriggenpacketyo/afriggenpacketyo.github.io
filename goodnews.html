          <p>Footwear company Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its nearly three-decade run as a public company. The acquisition price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current market valuation, leading to a surge in shares by over 25% following the announcement. Skechers' CEO, Robert Greenberg, will remain in his position after the acquisition is complete, and he believes this partnership will support the company's long-term growth. The deal occurs amidst challenges in the retail industry, including uncertainties stemming from global trade policies, although sources indicate that 3G Capital's interest predates these recent concerns.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's presence in an upscale Austin enclave has sparked controversy as neighbors complain about the construction of a 16-foot chain-link fence and other unpermitted security measures around his $6 million mansion. Residents have voiced concerns over increased traffic, constant security personnel shifts, and disruptions to their quiet neighborhood. The complaints escalated to a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting after Musk's team sought retroactive permission for the projects, which violated six city ordinances. While Musk's representatives argue the security measures are necessary due to his high profile, neighbors express frustration over the lack of communication and disregard for local regulations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amanda Hess's new book, Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age, examines the pervasive trend of parents seeking expertise and optimization in child-rearing through apps, gadgets, and online courses. Hess argues that the illusion of control sold by parenting experts is ultimately unhelpful, as the true experience of parenthood cannot be replicated or perfected through technology. The article explores the pressure on parents to resolve the "problem" of parenting with techniques that stamp out childishness itself, highlighting the commodification of parental helplessness. Hess suggests that while some advice is helpful, the idea of mastery in parenting is an illusion, and that the meaningful part of parenting lies in accepting the lack of control.</p>

          <p>Meta is phasing out traditional fact-checking on Facebook, Threads, and Instagram, shifting towards a Community Notes program where users can contradict posts with clarifying or corrective text. This move, following Elon Musk's similar approach on X, aims to prioritize free expression and sidestep political scrutiny over content moderation decisions. Community Notes relies on algorithms to assess notes based on diverse positive feedback, aiming to bridge divides by accounting for varying user biases. While this approach may be cost-effective and trusted by users, it's best suited for nitpicking individual falsehoods and may not counter sophisticated disinformation campaigns.</p>

Despite the transition, analysts believe Buffett will continue to mentor Abel and provide intellectual guidance, and shareholders should welcome this transparent transition.

          <p>The article discusses the waning influence of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation on Australian elections, noting that the organization has consistently supported the Coalition without discernible impact. The author suggests that News Corporation's outlets may now be a negative force for conservatives, distorting their views and making them out of touch with middle Australia. The decline in influence is attributed to the broader trend of mainstream media losing power and the public's increasing distrust of news outlets that lack objectivity. What people will pay for is reporting they trust and analysis written with integrity.</p>
