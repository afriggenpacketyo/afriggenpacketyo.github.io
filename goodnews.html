          <p>Redwood Materials, a startup founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, is giving old electric vehicle batteries a second life by using them in energy storage projects for AI data centers. As the AI boom drives a massive increase in energy demand, Redwood is repurposing batteries that still have usable capacity into microgrids. The company's first major project, in partnership with AI infrastructure firm Crusoe, is the largest of its kind in North America. This innovative approach aims to provide scalable, cost-effective, and renewable 24/7 power, addressing a critical bottleneck in the expansion of AI.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain That Revisions to Official Jobs Reports Are a Normal Feature of Data Collection</h2>

          <p>Following a significant downward revision of recent job numbers, which prompted President Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, experts are clarifying that such revisions are a standard part of the process. Former BLS officials and economists explain that initial monthly reports are preliminary, based on incomplete survey responses. The agency later revises these figures as more complete data becomes available, a process designed to balance timeliness with accuracy. While the recent revision was large, they are a common feature, not a sign of failure or manipulation, in economic reporting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The acting head of NASA has directed the agency to develop and launch a small nuclear power plant to the moon's surface by late 2029. The directive aims to establish a U.S. power source on the moon before potential rivals like China and Russia, who are planning a joint lunar reactor for the mid-2030s. The plan calls for a microreactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts of electricity to support the Artemis lunar exploration program. This ambitious goal comes amid proposed budget cuts for NASA and as the agency continues to operate without a Senate-confirmed leader.</p>

          <p>South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min is set to sign with Los Angeles FC in a landmark deal for Major League Soccer. The transfer fee to acquire the 33-year-old star from the English Premier League's Tottenham is reported to be the highest in MLS history, exceeding $22 million. The move is seen as a major coup for LAFC and the league, expected to significantly boost the team's offense and engage Southern California's large Korean American community. For Son, the transfer allows him to adapt to North American conditions ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," explores its central argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not an inevitable outcome but rather a product of miscalculation, hubris, and chance. The book focuses on the shah's inability to stop the movement, the U.S. government's oblivious and unfocused response, and the surprising rise of Ayatollah Khomeini. Anderson's account, based heavily on interviews with key American officials, portrays the revolution as a contingent event. It suggests that a series of specific actions and inactions, rather than grand historical forces, led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh the Pros and Cons of Purchasing an Annuity at Age 70</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether buying an annuity is a sound financial decision for a 70-year-old, weighing the potential benefits against the drawbacks. For healthy individuals seeking a guaranteed, lifelong income stream, purchasing an annuity later in life can result in higher monthly payments. However, annuities often lack liquidity, meaning the principal investment cannot be easily accessed for emergencies or left to heirs. The decision depends heavily on an individual's health, risk tolerance, other income sources, and overall financial goals, making it a complex choice for retirement planning.

          <p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, has announced that the country will hold its next general election in February 2026. This will be the first election since a student-led mass uprising in 2024 overthrew the government of longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The announcement was made as thousands gathered in the capital, Dhaka, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the uprising. Yunus, who leads the caretaker government, has pledged to ensure a fair and peaceful election and will step down after a new, elected government is in place.</p>

          <p>Students across Scotland have received exam results showing a slight increase in pass rates for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications compared to last year. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. Alongside these results, the university admissions service, Ucas, noted that a record number of young Scots have been offered university or college placements. Education officials described the results as a positive sign of recovery and a return to pre-pandemic performance levels for Scottish education.</p>
