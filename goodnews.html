          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling a decrease in inflation pressures that President Putin had previously described as "alarming". The decision comes as seasonally-adjusted inflation in April reached 6.2%, a notable drop from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand continues to outpace the expansion of goods and services, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually stabilizing. Monetary policy will remain stringent to achieve the 4% inflation target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla shares rose by 5% on Friday following a significant drop triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts attributed the rebound to speculation about a potential truce between the two figures, although a White House official denied any scheduled call between them. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's proposed tax and spending bill, leading to a sharp decline in Tesla's market capitalization. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggested that reconciliation between Musk and Trump would be beneficial for Tesla shares.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures aim to fully capitalize UBS's foreign units and reduce share buybacks. The Swiss National Bank supports these measures, believing they will significantly strengthen UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of government bailouts during crises. The proposed rules reflect concerns about the stability of systemically important banks and the need for greater financial safeguards.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing to reverse its ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, aiming to enhance the UK's competitiveness in the digital asset space. Crypto ETNs, a type of debt instrument linked to cryptocurrencies, have been prohibited in the UK since 2019 due to consumer protection concerns. The FCA believes that lifting the ban would allow informed choices on high-risk investments, while restrictions on crypto derivatives will remain. This move has been praised by crypto firms as a significant step forward for the industry in the UK.</p>

          <h2>German Chancellor's Visit to White House Overshadowed by Musk-Trump Feud</h2>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the visit was seen as a win for Merz, who addressed key issues such as U.S. support for Ukraine and higher NATO defense spending. Merz highlighted Germany's commitment to increased defense spending and emphasized the historical relationship between the U.S. and Germany. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party was seemingly avoided during the meeting.</p>
