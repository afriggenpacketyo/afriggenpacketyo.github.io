          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to uphold the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a body that recommends no-cost preventive care under the Affordable Care Act. The decision reverses a lower court ruling, affirming that the task force's members are "inferior officers" who can be appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This ruling ensures continued access to free services like cancer screenings and HIV-prevention medication, which were challenged by a group of Christian-owned businesses on religious grounds.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index achieved a new all-time high, climbing to 6,156 as investors looked past concerns about trade tensions and Middle East conflicts. The market has surged over 20% since an April low, fueled by a more moderate tariff stance from the Trump administration and signs of continued economic health. Analysts suggest that cautious optimism has replaced earlier fears, supported by steady hiring and inflation data that remains relatively low despite a recent uptick. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article provides a fact-check of viral social media claims targeting Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Socialist candidate for New York City mayor. It refutes allegations that he is a "raging antisemite," pointing to his work with Jewish politicians and public condemnation of antisemitism, while noting his controversial views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The report also debunks claims that Mamdani wants to implement Sharia law, highlighting his progressive platform that supports LGBTQIA+ rights and reproductive freedom, which often conflicts with conservative Islamic interpretations.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at the U.S. edition of Vogue. While the 75-year-old will remain Vogue's global editorial director and Cond√© Nast's chief content officer, the American publication will recruit a new head of editorial content. This change aligns the U.S. edition with other international versions of the magazine and will allow Wintour to focus more on her broader global and corporate responsibilities after leading U.S. Vogue since 1988.</p>

          <p>Tesla recently held a supervised, limited-scale launch of its "robotaxi" service in Austin, Texas, generating varied reactions. Some participants, including a Wedbush analyst, praised the vehicles' smoothness and maneuverability, while other reports noted incidents of cars driving on the wrong side of the road or stopping in traffic. The article highlights Tesla's unique camera-only approach to self-driving, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar, and frames the event as another step in a long-promised, yet-unrealized, vision of full autonomy.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have confirmed an agreement to accelerate the shipment of rare-earth minerals to the U.S., a key development in ongoing trade negotiations. The deal aims to ease Chinese export curbs on critical minerals, which have disrupted supply chains for industries like automotive and defense, in exchange for the U.S. easing some countermeasures. This progress, part of implementing a framework agreed upon in Geneva, helped push U.S. stock markets to new highs amid hopes of a broader de-escalation of the trade war.</p>

However, the article notes the company's history of unprofitability and a negative gross margin on its fuel business, suggesting these signs may not be sufficient to warrant investment.
