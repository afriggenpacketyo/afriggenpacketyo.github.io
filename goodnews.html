          <p>High-level discussions between the United States and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program are scheduled to resume in Oman, marking the sixth round of talks since April. These talks aim to establish a new agreement replacing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the U.S. withdrew during Trump's first term. Despite heightened regional tensions, a U.S. official confirmed that the U.S. delegation still plans to attend, and Iran's foreign minister expressed optimism about reaching a mutually beneficial outcome where Iran continues its enrichment program under IAEA supervision. However, Trump has reiterated that any potential agreement would not allow any uranium enrichment.</p>

Oracle anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $1.46 and $1.50 for the upcoming fiscal first quarter, with revenue growth projected in the 12% to 14% range, driven by significant growth in cloud infrastructure revenue.

          <p>Council tax is projected to increase by 5% annually to fund local services, including policing, according to documents in the Spending Review. Local authorities have the autonomy to raise the tax by up to 4.99% each year without central government approval, and the Spending Review assumes councils will maximize this increase. This forms part of the government's calculations for an average 2.3% annual real-terms increase in "police spending power." The Spending Review indicates that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will face a 1.4% real-terms cut in its day-to-day budget, although the government asserts that councils' "core spending power" will still rise if they increase council tax to the maximum extent.</p>

He emphasized that despite strained resources, Illinois remains committed to public safety, investing in state and local law enforcement. Pritzker urged Congress to reform the immigration system, allowing law-abiding immigrant families the same opportunities as his own.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are voicing resistance to a House GOP plan that would eliminate clean energy tax credits enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The House bill would halt roughly $522 billion in investments approved in the IRA, rolling back incentives for wind, solar, and hydrogen power, and phasing out consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Several GOP senators, including Lisa Murkowski and John Curtis, caution against a "full-scale repeal of current credits," citing concerns about uncertainty for businesses that have already invested in domestic energy production. The debate underscores divisions within the Republican party over energy policy and the future of clean energy investments.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan that would penalize colleges and universities whose students graduate with high debt and low earnings, while rewarding schools with better student outcomes. The risk-sharing plan would require institutions to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the federal loan debt their students fail to repay. The plan would also award "PROMISE Grants" to colleges that provide low-income students a great value for their money.

          <p>As climate change intensifies hurricane seasons, residents in hurricane-prone areas are taking steps to prepare their homes for potential flooding. Strategies include using flood-resistant building materials like tile floors and cement board, elevating homes, and obtaining flood insurance. Elevating electrical outlets can prevent short circuits and fires. While these adaptations can be costly, they can mitigate the extensive damage caused by flooding, such as warped floors, swollen drywall, and damaged electrical systems. Considering the costs of climate change, flood insurance and preparation become essential for homeowners and renters in vulnerable areas.</p>

Drawing on Hannah Arendt's insights, Williams notes that while protests can be used by rulers to justify displays of force, abandoning protest altogether leads to moral corruption. Williams emphasizes that the recent protests in Los Angeles against immigration raids are not symbolic but a direct response to protect communities from unjust actions. The choice is between protesting and allowing the raids to proceed, highlighting the importance of action over despair.</p>
