          <p>India's position within Global South alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brics presents a challenge to China's leadership ambitions. The consensus-based decision-making rules of these groups give India significant influence, often leading to stalemates that highlight underlying rivalries. For instance, a recent meeting of SCO defense chiefs failed to produce a joint statement due to disagreements over language concerning terrorism, a contentious issue between New Delhi and Beijing. This dynamic underscores the ongoing geopolitical competition and India's capacity to act as a check on Chinese dominance within these organizations.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of Wimbledon after a hard-fought third-round match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka, losing 7-6, 6-4. Raducanu delivered a strong performance, pushing the top seed and even serving for the first set, but was ultimately overcome by the three-time Grand Slam champion. Despite leading 4-1 in the second set, Raducanu's momentum faded as Sabalenka mounted a comeback. The competitive match on Centre Court demonstrated Raducanu's resilience and skill, even in defeat against the tournament favorite.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience has highlighted five "toxic" food categories he avoids giving to his own children to promote better long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of preservatives and nitrates. He also warns against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar spikes and deep-fried foods prepared in reused industrial oils. The doctor advocates for healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean proteins.</p>

England's innings was a story of two halves, with openers Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge scoring impressive half-centuries to build a strong foundation before a sudden collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. Despite a chaotic fielding performance, England's bowlers held their nerve in the final overs to clinch the crucial win.</p>

          <p>A provision in the new "big, beautiful bill" has been touted as eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security, but a closer look reveals it creates a new tax deduction rather than a full repeal. The bill introduces a temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds, which can be applied to all income. While the White House claims this will result in nearly 90% of beneficiaries paying no federal tax on their benefits, experts note it does not change the fundamental taxation of Social Security and primarily benefits higher-income seniors.
