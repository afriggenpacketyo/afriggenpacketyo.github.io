          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by robust revenue from its trading and investment banking divisions. Despite a year-over-year drop in net income due to a one-time gain in the previous year, the bank's core operations showed significant strength. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy and geopolitical tensions. The bank also raised its guidance for net interest income, a key indicator of profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghan nationals. The program, which provides deportation relief and work permits, was set to expire, but the court's ruling grants a one-week pause for further legal arguments. Advocacy groups praised the decision, arguing that Afghanistan remains unsafe and that ending the protections would be a betrayal. The administration has sought to curtail the TPS program, stating it was never intended to be permanent.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to prompt individuals with savings in low-interest accounts to invest in stocks and shares. The initiative, part of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' "Leeds Reforms," will involve banks sending investment information to savers, supported by a public advertising campaign. The goal is to generate better returns for savers and stimulate growth in the UK economy. However, concerns have been raised about potential risks for inexperienced investors and the possibility of increased fraudulent activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank's net income rose 25% year-over-year, with markets revenue up 16% and banking revenue climbing 18%. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence that her ongoing turnaround plan is yielding positive results. Despite the strong earnings, the bank did increase its allowance for credit losses, citing a deteriorating economic outlook compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report on top earner salaries often generates discussion, but many of its biggest stars are notably absent from the list. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to talent paid directly by the license-fee-funded part of the BBC. Stars who are employed by the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, or by independent production companies that create shows for the BBC, are not included. This distinction is intended to allow BBC Studios to compete on a level playing field with other commercial entities, but it results in an incomplete picture of talent compensation.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership has declared a fundamental shift in the country's approach to urban development, moving away from large-scale expansion towards optimizing existing city resources. At a high-level meeting attended by President Xi Jinping, officials stated that with 67% of the population now in urban areas, the focus must be on enhancing efficiency and human well-being. This new model prioritizes projects like renovating urban villages and repairing old housing. The change is part of a broader effort to establish a new growth framework for the nation's struggling property sector.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully used publicly available satellite data from NASA to identify promising locations for deep-sea mining in the Indian Ocean. The data, from the U.S. GRACE satellites, revealed gravity anomalies over the Ninety East Ridge, which indicated areas where the Earth's crust is unusually thick. These thickened zones are often rich in valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths, as magma pushes them closer to the seabed. By utilizing this open-source information, the researchers were able to pinpoint potential mining sites, potentially saving significant time and resources in their exploration efforts.</p>

The grants will apply to eligible vehicles priced up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million initiative aimed at making EVs more affordable for families. The move supports the government's goal to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. However, critics and some consumers argue that the high upfront cost of EVs and the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.</p>
