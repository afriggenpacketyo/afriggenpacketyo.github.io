          <p>Opendoor's stock price soared by 80% after the company announced significant leadership changes, naming Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. This marks a dramatic turnaround for the real estate technology company, whose stock has risen over 500% this year after previously trading below $1 and facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. The leadership shuffle follows the resignation of former CEO Carrie Wheeler amid pressure from investors. Nejatian has stated the company will focus on using artificial intelligence to simplify the home buying and selling process, signaling a strategic shift for the firm.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced a surge in consumer interest for its new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras. The palm-sized cameras, which come in blind box packaging and feature vintage film-style filters, sold out quickly on Kodak's website and are now available mostly by pre-order. This early success comes at a critical time for Kodak, which recently posted a significant net loss and warned about its ability to continue operations. The high demand for the Charmera suggests the company has successfully tapped into Gen Z's appetite for nostalgic, pre-digital technology and Y2K-era aesthetics, potentially providing a much-needed financial boost.</p>

          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting several potential candidates on President Donald Trump's shortlist. Bessent has recently met with former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard, with interviews of sitting officials planned for after the next FOMC meeting's blackout period. Alongside the search, Bessent is advocating for Fed reforms, including a non-disruptive reduction of the central bank's $6 trillion balance sheet and a smaller overall economic footprint. The selection process occurs amid White House pressure for an interest rate cut, which markets widely anticipate at the Fed's upcoming meeting.</p>

Following the news, shares of Warner Bros. Discovery surged over 25%, while Paramount Skydance's stock also saw a significant increase. The potential merger comes as the media industry grapples with the shift from traditional pay TV to streaming and follows Paramount's recent $8 billion merger with Skydance.

The extensive display features over 200 artifacts, including original props, storyboard sketches, and interactive stations that allow visitors to engage with the filmmaking process. At the launch event, Spielberg recounted the notoriously difficult production, which he once feared would end his career due to being severely over budget and behind schedule. The exhibition highlights the film's cultural impact, which defined the modern summer blockbuster and established Spielberg as a major Hollywood director, while also showcasing its enduring legacy.</p>

          <h2>Belarus Releases 52 Political Prisoners in Deal with U.S. to Ease Sanctions</h2>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including journalists and activists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure partial relief from U.S. sanctions. In exchange, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. Authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko framed the release as a humanitarian gesture, though over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated following his brutal crackdown on 2020 pro-democracy protests. The deal signals an attempt by Belarus to mend relations with the West amid its close alliance with Russia and the economic strain of sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Benefits May See Slightly Higher Cost-of-Living Increase in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 14:46:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on recent inflation data, analysts are estimating that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be between 2.7% and 2.8%. This would provide a modest increase to the monthly checks received by millions of beneficiaries, raising the average retirement benefit by approximately $54 per month. The projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% COLA implemented in 2025 but remains below the record-high adjustments seen in recent years when inflation was more severe. The official COLA will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced details of the recent U.S.-Japan tariff deal, revealing that the two countries will equally share profits from American-based projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment. This 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement will continue until Japan recoups its initial investment. After that point, the profit split will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The deal, which sets a 15% baseline tariff on Japanese goods, is intended to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in priority areas like nuclear power and antibiotics, funded by capital from Tokyo in exchange for more favorable trade terms.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's CEO, Scott Strazik, acknowledged challenges in the company's wind energy sector, projecting a 10% to 15% revenue decline for the segment in 2026 due to soft orders and the current administration's stance against wind projects. Despite this, Strazik expressed optimism about growth in the company's gas power and electrification businesses. In other market news, Boeing's stock received a lift after Southwest Airlines announced it was increasing its delivery expectations for the year. This positive development for the aerospace giant comes as it also reached a tentative agreement to end a strike at its defense business in St. Louis.</p>

          <p>The race for the UK Labour Party's deputy leadership has narrowed to a two-person contest between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. The only other candidate, Bell Riberio-Addy, failed to secure the necessary nominations from fellow Members of Parliament to advance. Phillipson has garnered the most support from MPs, positioning her as an early frontrunner, while Powell aims to act as a "bridge for all parts" of the party. The contest was initiated by Angela Rayner's resignation and the winner, to be decided by a ballot of party members in October, will hold a powerful position within the party.</p>

          <p>USC running back Waymond Jordan has become a breakout star, leading one of the nation's top rushing offenses after a challenging journey that began with no scholarship offers out of high school. Initially overlooked by major programs, Jordan attended Hutchinson Community College in Kansas, where he overcame injuries and redshirted a year to develop his skills. Believing in his potential, he turned down smaller university offers to play another season in junior college, a bet that paid off when he was named national player of the year and attracted attention from top programs like USC. His perseverance has culminated in a starring role on a major college football stage.</p>
