          <p>Ispace, a Japanese company, is attempting a moon landing with its Resilience lander in the unexplored far north of the moon, carrying a mini rover named Tenacious. This follows the company's previous failed moonshot, and Resilience aims to land in the Mare Frigoris, a flat area with few boulders. The rover, built with carbon fiber, will scout the area with a high-definition camera and collect lunar dirt for NASA. Ispace envisions this mission as a stepping stone toward establishing lunar infrastructure and a permanent human presence, with future missions planned with NASA involvement. The optimism score reflects the progress in commercial space exploration.</p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise announced its plans to move its primary listing to the United States, a significant setback for the London Stock Exchange. Wise intends to establish a dual listing, shifting its main hub to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. The company stated that this move would enable its shares to trade on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE. News of this shift led to an almost 11% increase in Wise's shares on Thursday morning. The optimism score reflects the positive market reaction to the company's decision.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece challenges the narrative that trade with China gutted American manufacturing, arguing that the negative effects have been exaggerated. The author cites a comprehensive review that suggests populist narratives blaming trade with China for U.S. economic decline are not supported by rigorous evidence. The piece highlights that the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began before China's WTO entry and that job losses were often offset by gains in other sectors. The author concludes that the real shock is the resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering legislation to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes from financial collapse after the Los Angeles wildfires. Assembly Bill 226 would allow the FAIR Plan, the state‚Äôs insurer of last resort, to access loans and bonds to avoid running out of money after disasters. Other proposed bills aim to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections for disaster victims.
