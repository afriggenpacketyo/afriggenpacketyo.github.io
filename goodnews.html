          <p>Actor Celia Rose Gooding shared her experience playing the iconic character Nyota Uhura in the prequel series "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds." She expressed gratitude for the warm reception from the devoted "Trekkie" fanbase, who have embraced her interpretation of a younger Uhura as a Starfleet cadet. Gooding explained that she deliberately avoided researching the character's future storylines to maintain a sense of discovery appropriate for her character's age. She noted that an upcoming episode will explore a turning point for Uhura as she confronts her responsibilities within Starfleet while also enjoying lighter moments, including a new romance.</p>

The agreement will see Authentic Brands own 51% of the company's intellectual property, with the remaining 49% held by Guess co-founders and its CEO. Shareholders are set to receive $16.75 per share, representing a 26% premium over the stock's previous closing price, which caused shares to jump over 25% after the announcement. The current management team will continue to operate the business, which they state will have greater flexibility as a private entity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tiger Woods has been appointed to chair a new PGA Tour committee tasked with redesigning the sport's competitive structure in the United States. The announcement came as the Tour's new chief executive, Brian Rolapp, indicated that unification with the Saudi-backed LIV circuit is not an immediate priority. Rolapp stated his focus is on strengthening the PGA Tour independently and that he has not held discussions with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. This development suggests that while the PGA Tour is focused on internal evolution, a resolution to the divide in elite professional golf remains distant.</p>

          <p>South African authorities have arrested six individuals, including well-known rhinoceros breeder John Hume, in connection with an international rhino horn trafficking network. The suspects are accused of smuggling 964 horns, valued at over $14 million, to illegal markets in Southeast Asia. The arrests follow a seven-year investigation by the country's specialized Hawks police unit. Hume, former owner of the world's largest rhino farm, has previously been a controversial figure for auctioning rhino horns. Conservation groups have praised the arrests as a crucial step in disrupting the organized crime that fuels rhino poaching.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a new Texas law that would have required every public school classroom to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, set to take effect September 1, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause by unconstitutionally coercing students into religious observance. The lawsuit was filed by a group of families from diverse religious and nonreligious backgrounds, represented by the ACLU and other advocacy groups. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has announced the state will appeal the decision, defending the law as a reflection of national heritage.</p>

          <p>Thirty prominent figures from the cryptocurrency industry, including executives from Coinbase and Kraken, have sent an open letter to the UK's finance minister urging the creation of a national stablecoin strategy. The letter argues that the UK must act proactively to avoid falling behind the United States and become a "rule-maker" in the digital asset space. They contend that stablecoins should be embraced as financial infrastructure rather than viewed as a risk to be contained. The signatories believe a national strategy would bolster the UK's position as a global financial hub and generate new revenue streams.</p>

          <p>Home improvement retailer Lowe's exceeded Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, driven by increased demand for smaller home projects. Concurrently, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion, a strategic move to attract more business from home professionals. CEO Marvin Ellison noted that while sales to DIY customers improved, demand for larger projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates. The acquisition is part of Lowe's strategy to position itself for growth when the housing market becomes more active, following a similar pro-focused strategy as its rival, Home Depot.

          <h2>Secure Data Erasure from Discarded Electronics Becomes a Major Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 12:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The business of securely erasing data from used and discarded IT equipment, known as IT asset disposition (ITAD), is rapidly expanding. With global e-waste projected to reach 82 million metric tons by 2030, the risk of data breaches from improperly handled devices like smartphones, computers, and servers is a major cybersecurity concern. ITAD providers use methods like physical destruction and specialized software to ensure sensitive personal and corporate data is unrecoverable. This service is becoming increasingly vital as research shows that factory resets often leave residual data behind, creating vulnerabilities for cyber criminals.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while generative AI may reduce traditional search traffic, it presents a significant long-term opportunity for both Google and web publishers. The author suggests that high-value AI conversations about topics like travel, health, and finance are worth far more than simple search clicks. Google can monetize these complex interactions through its vast advertising network, turning a single query into a full-service transaction. Similarly, publishers can leverage their trusted brands and deep content to host their own AI conversations, shifting from a pageview-based model to one centered on valuable, relationship-driven interactions.</p>
