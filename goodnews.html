          <p>The Rabin Medical Center in Israel is making specialized preparations to receive hostages released from Gaza, developing what staff are calling "captivity medicine." Medical teams are drawing on lessons from previous releases, focusing on acting as "medical detectives" to uncover the physical and psychological trauma endured over more than 700 days of captivity. The hospital has created a dedicated unit designed to be calming, with private rooms and space for family, prioritizing a slow, patient-centric approach to recovery. Staff recognize that the long-term effects of captivity on both body and soul will take considerable time to emerge and treat.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team has maintained its undefeated streak in the World Cup with a decisive 89-run victory against Sri Lanka. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a magnificent 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings, guiding England to a total of 253-9. In response, Sri Lanka's batting lineup faltered under pressure from Sophie Ecclestone, who delivered an exceptional bowling performance, taking four wickets for just 17 runs. The victory places England at the top of the tournament table ahead of their next match against Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London in April 2024, has been retired to a sanctuary in the countryside. The 15-year-old horse sustained significant injuries after being spooked by construction noise and was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. The incident, which saw the horses collide with vehicles and injure several soldiers and civilians, drew widespread public attention. Quaker will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, ensuring his long-term welfare and recovery.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have officially backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan hinges on the SNP winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election, which the party would then present as a clear mandate for another vote on Scottish independence. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path forward, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. The endorsement overrides an alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum itself, solidifying the party's official strategy.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, particularly from Gen Z, are pushing back against the "fast furniture" industry by opting for secondhand and vintage items. This trend is driven by an increased awareness of the environmental impact of cheap, mass-produced decor, which often ends up in landfills after a short lifespan. Consumers are turning to platforms like Facebook Marketplace and embracing the process of repairing and upcycling older pieces, valuing sustainability and the unique stories behind them. This shift reflects a broader consumer movement away from disposable goods and toward more durable and meaningful possessions.</p>

          <p>Political analysts suggest that US President Donald Trump's direct pressure was a critical factor in brokering the potential peace agreement between Israel and Hamas. According to Jonathan Karl of ABC News, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reliance on American support made him susceptible to Trump's influence, compelling him to agree to the deal. As American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, the necessity of maintaining a strong relationship with the US president became paramount for the Israeli leader. The agreement is seen as a significant turning point, with its long-term viability now under close observation.</p>
