        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Islanders chose 17-year-old defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the number one overall pick in the NHL draft. The selection was a deeply emotional moment for Schaefer, whose mother, Jennifer, died from breast cancer 16 months ago. In a touching tribute, Schaefer kissed a pink ribbon patch on his new jersey, which also featured his mother's initials, and pointed to the sky, honoring her memory as he embarked on his professional hockey career.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions commenced their Australian tour with a decisive 54-7 win over the Western Force, scoring eight tries in front of a record crowd in Perth. Despite an undisciplined start that saw them concede early penalties and possession, the Lions' clinical attack proved overwhelming in the second half. The otherwise successful match was shadowed by a potentially serious hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had played exceptionally well and scored two tries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that Zohran Mamdani's surprising victory in the New York City mayoral primary was heavily influenced by the organized, grassroots movement advocating for Palestinian rights. The author argues that Mamdani's vocal support for Palestine, once considered a political risk, resonated deeply with a shifting Democratic base, particularly young voters and activists. This alignment transformed a potential liability into a core strength, mobilizing a powerful volunteer ground game against a well-funded establishment opponent.</p>

May 2025 was India's wettest since 1901, providing much-needed relief to the drought-prone region after the lake ran dry last year. While this is a positive development for local water security, officials note it is also a symptom of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events linked to climate change.</p>
