        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has caused severe supply shortages and price hikes, even in Japan. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the past decade, with prices for tencha, the tea used for matcha, jumping 170% at a recent auction. The demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and producers, leading retailers to ration supplies and the government to consider subsidies to encourage more tencha cultivation.</p>

The data showed 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat the high absence rates that have persisted since the pandemic.</p>

After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not perform at her peak. She used the summer break for knee surgery and counseling, and now feels mentally and physically rejuvenated ahead of the new Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over slowing growth rates, Nvidia's recent financial results show continued strong demand for its AI-powering chips, with revenue growing 56% year-over-year to $46.7 billion. Some analysts predict the company is on a path to a $10 trillion market capitalization by the end of the decade, fueled by massive projected spending on AI infrastructure. To achieve this, the company's stock price would need to gain 127% from its current $4.4 trillion valuation, a goal some experts believe is attainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee of President Trump, is stepping down from his leadership role at the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure, declaring his mission "accomplished." His focus was to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool to counter Chinese influence and generate returns for the United States, rather than a traditional development program. This shift aligns with the "America First" agenda, emphasizing projects in strategically important nations like Nepal and Kosovo to secure critical resources and strengthen U.S. leverage.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to reduce human-wolf conflicts, biologists near the California-Oregon border are using drones to haze gray wolves away from livestock. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from films to startle the predators and interrupt their hunts. This nonlethal technique is part of a creative push to find coexistence strategies as wolf populations recover and increasingly come into contact with ranching operations in the Western U.S.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit signals a potential recalibration of the relationship between the two Asian giants. Both nations are facing economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, creating a shared incentive to improve ties that have been strained by long-standing border disputes. While deep-seated mistrust remains, the meeting is seen as a pivotal moment for exploring economic cooperation and projecting Global South solidarity in a shifting geopolitical landscape.</p>
