          <p>Despite exceeding earnings and revenue forecasts for its fiscal third quarter, Palo Alto Networks' stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading. The cybersecurity firm's next-generation security annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached $5 billion, with Cortex XSIAM being a standout performer. CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized the company's platformization strategy, aiming to consolidate customer spending on Palo Alto's suite of products. The stock's dip is attributed to the company maintaining its full-year outlook, which disappointed investors who expected an increase after the strong quarterly performance.
