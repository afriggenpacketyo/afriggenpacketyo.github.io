          <h2>Nintendo Anticipates Strong Sales for Switch 2 Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 05:03:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with Omdia expecting nearly as many sales in 2025 alone. The company also reported its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results, showing a decrease in revenue and profit due to anticipation for the new console. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concern that additional tariffs could impact demand in the U.S., potentially affecting profit. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, noted that Nintendo's forecasts are typically conservative, but tariffs create an unclear future for the company.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation. The agreement would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, later pausing them for negotiations. Details remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. Timothy C. Brightbill, an international trade attorney, suggests the announcement may be a framework for future negotiations covering tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and digital trade.</p>

          <p>A woman's children discovered a box of letters their mother received from WWII soldiers, offering a glimpse into her life as a young woman working at Red Cross dances in Rome. The letters, written by servicemen, express their admiration for her, while her comment cards reveal her thoughts on each suitor. The article highlights the contrast between the mother they knew and the young woman who enjoyed socializing with soldiers during the war. One particularly poignant letter from a Commander expresses his unrequited love for her.</p>

          <p>California beaches are experiencing an influx of Velella velella, also known as by-the-wind sailors, creating a beautiful display of glittering blue creatures. These small, gelatinous organisms are typically found on the open sea but are being blown ashore due to a shift in wind direction. The article explains that these creatures are related to jellyfish but are harmless to humans, though contact with sensitive areas should be avoided. Scientists suggest that the mass strandings may be linked to rising ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of an imminent trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. While details of the agreement are not yet clear, it would be a significant achievement for Starmer, who has made a point of forging a warm relationship with Trump. Starmer has also tried to act as a bridge between Europe and the United States, coaching President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on how to mend his rift with Mr. Trump.</p>

The report stated that one of three supergrid transformers became disconnected and caught fire. Power was restored to Heathrow's terminals around seven hours before flights resumed.</p>
