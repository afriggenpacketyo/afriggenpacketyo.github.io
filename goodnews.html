          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed in principle on a framework to implement a consensus reached on resolving trade disputes, according to Chinese state media. This announcement followed two days of talks in London, building on prior negotiations in Geneva where a 90-day suspension of tariffs was agreed upon. The discussions aimed to address disagreements over advanced semiconductors, visas for Chinese students, and rare earth minerals, with both sides seeking to ease restrictions and open up trade opportunities.

          <p>Following two days of high-level talks in London, the U.S. and China have reached a framework agreement to implement the Geneva trade consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and China's international trade representative Li Chenggang confirmed the agreement, which aims to stabilize relations after recent accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. The framework involves a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs added in April and a rollback of certain other measures. Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will brief President Trump, while China will brief President Xi Jinping, indicating that unresolved details still require internal discussion.

The report recommends a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies, protecting school playtime, and opening up school playgrounds to the community.
