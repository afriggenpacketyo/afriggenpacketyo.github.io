          <p>In an interview, Dr. Allen Frances discusses his perspective on the significant increase in autism diagnoses over the past several decades. He reflects on his involvement in shaping the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and how changes in diagnostic criteria may have contributed to the rising rates. Dr. Frances explains that while the definition of autism has broadened, it has helped many people get access to necessary services, though it has also created diagnostic inflation.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial "revenge tax" provision from former President Trump's major legislative package at the request of the Treasury Secretary. The provision would have allowed the U.S. to tax companies from countries deemed to have unfair foreign tax policies, a measure critics warned would deter foreign investment. The removal, prompted by progress on a global tax deal, complicates Republican efforts to offset the cost of the bill as they rush to meet a July 4th deadline.</p>
