          <h2>Truth Social Moves Towards Bitcoin ETF Launch</h2>

          <p>President Trump's Truth Social platform is progressing toward launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) after NYSE Arca filed to list a bitcoin fund linked to Trump Media. This filing is required before regulators can decide whether to allow the fund to launch and trade on a U.S. exchange. The fund, called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, is designed to track the price of bitcoin and offer a simpler way for investors to gain exposure without holding the asset directly (not investment advice). The filing follows an announced partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to bring a suite of digital asset products to market later this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl and her family, allowing her to continue receiving life-saving treatment in the US. The family, who came to the US in 2023 seeking medical care for their daughter's rare condition, had previously been ordered to "self-deport." The decision sparked outrage from Democratic lawmakers, who urged the Department of Homeland Security to extend the family's legal status, emphasizing the need to protect the sick and vulnerable. The administration has now granted the family Humanitarian Parole for a period of one year.</p>

          <p>The California Senate has approved a bill to enhance the safety of AI chatbots, particularly those used for companionship, after concerns were raised about their impact on mental health. The bill requires chatbot operators to remind users that virtual characters aren't human and to disclose potential unsuitability for minors. It also mandates protocols for addressing suicidal ideation and self-harm expressed by users. The legislation aims to balance innovation with ethical responsibility, particularly regarding the potential for children to prioritize interactions with AI over real human relationships.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions on Wells Fargo, imposed in 2018 following a fake-accounts scandal, citing improvements in the bank's corporate culture. The scandal, which involved employees opening unauthorized accounts to meet sales goals, cost the bank billions in fines and damaged its reputation. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf announced a $2,000 award for each of the bank's 215,000 employees in recognition of their efforts to turn the bank around. With the removal of the asset cap, Wells Fargo can now pursue growth opportunities, including higher deposits and new accounts.</p>
