          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that federal immigration agents have taken the family of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Colorado fire attack on demonstrators, into custody. The White House indicated that the family could be deported as early as tonight. Authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family had any knowledge or involvement in the attack, which targeted a group calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Soliman is an Egyptian national married with five children, and the family resides in Colorado Springs. Optimism regarding the safety of the public may be improved with this news.</p>

          <p>The England Lionesses experienced a mixed week of results as they prepare for the Euros. Mary Earps' international retirement and Millie Bright's withdrawal posed challenges for manager Wiegman. The team responded with a strong performance against Portugal but suffered a defeat against Spain in the Nations League. Wiegman emphasized the week's value in providing players with necessary minutes and experience, viewing the Spain loss as a learning opportunity. The team's performance is a mixed bag, with both positive and negative takeaways.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The UK will maintain the existing 25% tariff rate.

          <p>A U.S. judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care to transgender inmates, despite an executive order from President Trump aimed at halting such care. The judge allowed a class-action lawsuit challenging the order and mandated the provision of hormone therapy and accommodations. The ruling does not require surgical care related to gender transitions. The Department of Justice argued for deference to the president's policy decision, but the judge emphasized the importance of respecting all laws, including those protecting against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
