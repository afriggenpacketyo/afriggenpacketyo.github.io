          <p>Glorya Kaufman, a philanthropist whose immense generosity reshaped the dance landscape in Los Angeles, has died at 95. Her historic donations established the USC Kaufman School of Dance and the influential 'Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance' series at the Music Center, bringing world-class performances to the city. Born in Detroit, she dedicated herself to philanthropy after the death of her husband, Donald Kaufman, co-founder of KB Home.

          <p>President Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple will increase its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. This move is part of a broader initiative to bring more of Apple's supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the United States. The announcement signals a significant step toward the administration's goal of having more U.S.-sold products made domestically. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a revealing BBC interview, UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch shared a story from her teenage years about reporting a fellow student for cheating on an exam, which led to his expulsion. She used the anecdote to illustrate her deep-seated dislike for rule-breaking, a value she says was shaped by her childhood in Nigeria. Badenoch also discussed losing her faith, her identity as a "cultural Christian," and the "poverty of low expectations" she encountered from some teachers in the UK. The interview provides insight into the personal experiences that have influenced her political character and ideology.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated, albeit brief, return to the Hollywood Bowl, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. His single week of performances this season included a program blending the music of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, featuring pianist Seong-Jin Cho. The concert was a vibrant display of the orchestra's versatility, particularly in its rare and energetic performance of Ellington's symphonic works. The return is bittersweet, however, as travel issues have forced the cancellation of an upcoming visit by his Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to tighten regulations on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from harm. Under the new proposals, high-risk procedures like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals. Additionally, clinics offering treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers will need to obtain a license by meeting strict standards for safety, training, and insurance. The crackdown aims to curb the number of rogue practitioners and address the dangers associated with the booming, and often unregulated, cosmetic procedures market.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin could occur "very soon," potentially as early as next week, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The statement follows what Trump described as "highly productive" talks between his special envoy and Russian officials in Moscow. White House sources suggest Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This development comes as a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face further sanctions approaches, signaling a potential diplomatic push from the administration.</p>

          <p>The signing of South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min is a strategic move by LAFC to expand its global brand and solidify its presence in the competitive Los Angeles sports market. The 33-year-old forward, joining from Tottenham Hotspur for a record MLS transfer fee, is expected to be a dominant player and attract a massive international following, particularly from South Korea. His arrival builds on the foundation laid by Carlos Vela, aiming to connect with L.A.'s diverse communities while elevating the club's name on the world stage, similar to what Lionel Messi has done for Inter Miami.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. This trend is attributed to universities seeking the financial stability offered by domestic students amid uncertainty surrounding international enrollment. With universities making more offers, there may be fewer places available through the 'clearing' process. The development comes as tuition fees for students in England and Wales are set to rise for the first time since 2017.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets are anticipating that the Bank of England will cut its key interest rate on Thursday, potentially lowering it from 4.25% to 4.0%. This would be the fifth reduction since last August and would bring borrowing costs to their lowest point in over two years. A rate cut would offer some relief to homeowners with variable-rate mortgages but would mean lower returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation, and the Bank is also set to release updated economic forecasts alongside its interest rate announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Resettling in Pompeii's Ruins After Eruption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological evidence suggests that survivors of the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe that some people who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by other settlers, created a precarious settlement within the devastated city. This informal community appears to have existed until the 5th century, with people inhabiting the upper floors of buried homes and using lower levels as cellars. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned, revealing a previously overlooked chapter in Pompeii's history.</p>
