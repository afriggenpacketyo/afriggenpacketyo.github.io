        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate reached 2.1% in May, according to preliminary data from Destatis, edging slightly above analyst expectations of 2% but approaching the European Central Bank's 2% target. This figure is harmonized across the Eurozone for comparability, and follows a 2.2% reading in April. While Germany's consumer price index has been nearing the ECB's target in recent months, uncertainty persists regarding the country's economic outlook. Domestic and global issues, including potential impacts from U.S. tariffs and the implementation of new government policies, continue to influence economic expectations. The ECB is scheduled to make its next interest rate decision on June 5, with a high probability of a quarter-point interest rate reduction priced in. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, ending one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, coinciding with efforts by the Trump administration to demonstrate support for the sector. Binance has recently partnered with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project, and Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council.</p>

          <p>Political philosopher Erica Benner challenges the popular view of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, arguing that his famous work, *The Prince*, is actually a satirical critique of authoritarian power. Benner suggests that Machiavelli is more concerned with human nature and the creation of a political system that allows people to coexist. She highlights Machiavelli's republicanism, emphasizing his belief in shared power and the importance of checking power within a government. Benner also suggests that Machiavelli's insights are relevant to contemporary politics, particularly in understanding the rise of leaders like Trump and the importance of maintaining democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The art of Christina Ramberg explores the artifice of the female body and the various ways women construct themselves with the aid of the mass market. Her paintings feature torsos in corsets, feet in high heels, and intricately arranged updos, often cropped or angled to never show faces. Ramberg's work captures the dueling reactions of fascination and repulsion towards the construction of femininity, highlighting the interplay between unruly and taming forces. The artist's exploration of hidden desires and the artificiality of self-presentation offers a complex and thought-provoking commentary on the expectations placed on women.</p>

The Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, introduced in the Senate, would require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles. The bill has gained support from organizations across the political spectrum, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and anti-abortion groups.

The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports, which has cushioned the impact of global economic uncertainty.
