          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has reached the quarter-finals of the Washington Open after a decisive straight-sets victory over four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. Raducanu's 6-4 6-2 win continues her strong performance in the tournament, where she will next face wildcard Maria Sakkari. In the men's singles competition, however, British players Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans were both eliminated in the last 16. Norrie lost to Brandon Nakashima, while 2023 champion Evans was defeated by Corentin Moutet.</p>

          <p>The romantic comedy "Oh, Hi!" starring Logan Lerman and Molly Gordon, delves into the complexities of modern dating and the "softboy" archetype. The film follows Iris (Gordon) and Isaac (Lerman) on a weekend getaway that sours when Isaac reveals his fear of commitment, leading to a tense, hostage-like situation. The article praises Molly Gordon's comedic performance but notes the film struggles with its tone, shifting between light romance and psychological thriller. It critiques the passivity of Lerman's character while acknowledging the film's smart, if underdeveloped, commentary on gender tropes and relationship expectations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the current state of foldable smartphones, highlighting them as impressive technological achievements that come with significant drawbacks. While devices like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Flip offer larger screens and a novel user experience, they are criticized for their high prices, increased fragility, and bulkiness compared to traditional phones. The author also notes that battery life and software optimization still lag behind standard models. The article advises most consumers to wait on adopting the technology, suggesting that Apple is likely developing its own more refined foldable device for a future release.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor Tony Evers of Wisconsin has announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. In his announcement, the 73-year-old governor cited a desire to spend more time with his family after five decades in public service. His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. The decision opens a key race in the battleground state, where Democrats also hope to gain control of the legislature under newly redrawn maps.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Ruling That Could Weaken Voting Rights Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:52:27 EDT</div>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended a temporary pause on a lower court ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that could significantly weaken the Voting Rights Act. The controversial ruling held that private individuals and groups cannot sue under Section 2 of the act, limiting enforcement to the U.S. Justice Department. The case originated from a lawsuit by two tribal nations in North Dakota challenging a state legislative map for diluting Native American voting power. This temporary stay preserves the current map for the 2026 election while the tribal nations prepare to ask the high court for a full review.</p>

          <p>Industrial manufacturer Dover saw its shares fall despite reporting second-quarter results that surpassed expectations and raising its full-year guidance. The company's revenue grew 5% to $2.05 billion, with adjusted earnings per share at $2.44, beating consensus estimates. This article argues that the market is misjudging the company's performance, pointing to record profit margins, accelerating bookings, and strategic investments in high-growth areas like data center cooling and biopharma. The analysis suggests Dover's portfolio transformation is not fully appreciated, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly refuted claims that he intends to strip government subsidies from Elon Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated he wants all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to "THRIVE like never before." This declaration comes amid a contentious public feud between the two figures and speculation that Trump might retaliate against Musk by targeting his companies' significant government contracts and environmental credits. The article notes the substantial financial ties Musk's businesses have to the government, including billions in contracts and regulatory credit sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England established a commanding position on the second day of the fourth Test against India, driven by a five-wicket haul from Ben Stokes and a rapid opening partnership. Stokes' performance, his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helped restrict India to a first-innings total of 358. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley (84) and Ben Duckett (94) scored quickly, putting on 166 runs. The day also featured a dramatic return by India's Rishabh Pant, who batted despite a suspected broken foot, scoring a brave 54 before England's bowlers wrapped up the innings.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has made it clear he is not dwelling on the team's Super Bowl LIX victory from five months ago. Speaking to reporters at the start of training camp, the former Super Bowl MVP emphasized that "the past is behind us" and that the team is focused on the "new journey" of the upcoming season. Hurts acknowledged the surreal feeling of receiving his championship ring but stated he has "moved on" and is not wearing it.

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is growing significantly, according to a report from the Brookings Institution. Job postings that mention AI have increased by over 100% in the last year alone and have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years. This growth is driven by more companies integrating AI into their operations, creating a need for roles ranging from specialized AI engineers to consultants who help with implementation. These AI-related jobs are often associated with higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar positions that do not require AI skills.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its decision to eliminate paper checks for beneficiaries, confirming it will continue issuing them to those who have no other means of receiving payments. The agency had previously announced a plan to switch entirely to electronic deposits after September 30, citing cost savings and security. The reversal followed a meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, where the senator raised concerns about the approximately 600,000 Americans, many of whom are unbanked, who still rely on paper checks for their retirement and disability benefits.</p>
