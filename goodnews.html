          <h2>UK Economy Shows Encouraging Growth, But Challenges Remain</h2>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing forecasts and signaling a potential turning point according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This growth was largely driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts caution that this rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While Reeves acknowledges the ongoing cost of living crisis, she remains optimistic about the UK's economic prospects. Some business leaders express concern over the rising costs of doing business and are hesitant to make expansion decisions amid economic uncertainty. Optimism surrounds the potential for falling interest rates to positively affect consumer spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changing economic conditions and policy uncertainty. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with inflation expectations largely aligned with the Fed's 2% target. He cautioned about the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, which could pose challenges for the economy and central banks. While Powell did not directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he has previously noted their potential to slow growth and increase inflation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a high-interest rate environment, experts advise strategic borrowing from home equity using home equity loans or HELOCs, which typically offer lower interest rates than unsecured loans and credit cards. Key rules include shopping and comparing rates and terms from various lenders, understanding potential fees like origination or appraisal fees, and choosing the right repayment term. Experts recommend focusing on the intended use of funds to guide borrowing decisions, suggesting pausing if there is no clear need. Borrowing against your home should be approached thoughtfully to ensure it aligns with overall financial plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a recent US-Britain trade agreement lowering some tariffs and creating export opportunities, significant differences in food production standards could impede a comprehensive deal. US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is in London to promote the agreement and counter negative perceptions of American meat. British consumers are wary of hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, reflecting concerns about food safety, animal welfare, and environmental protections. While the agreement sets import quotas, British standards would need to allow more American products, and consumers would have to buy them for American exports to increase materially.</p>
