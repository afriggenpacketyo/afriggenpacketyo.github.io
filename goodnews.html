          <p>High-level delegations from the United States and China are meeting in London to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that has roiled the global economy.

These talks follow negotiations in Geneva last month that resulted in a 90-day suspension of tariffs.

          <p>NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to address a challenging blood shortage, aiming to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million. The NHS has warned that it continues to face a challenging blood shortage, as it calls for 200,000 new donors to come forward. Supplies have remained low ever since, with officials warning there is a "critical" need for more donors who have O negative blood, which can be given to the majority of patients. There is a pressing need to avoid a "red alert", which would mean demand far exceeds capacity, threatening public safety, NHSBT added.</p>
