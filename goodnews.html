          <p>President Trump has given the green light to the merger between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, reversing the previous administration's decision to block the acquisition based on national security concerns. Trump stated that the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. The decision led to a significant surge in U.S. Steel's stock price. Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh to celebrate the deal.</p>

          <p>In a bid to combat the drastic decline of Florida's coral reefs, scientists are implementing a large-scale restoration project by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles. The Florida Keys have witnessed a staggering 90% loss in healthy coral cover over the past four decades, primarily due to climate change and record ocean heat. The project involves acclimatizing the corals in temperature-regulated seawater beds before distributing them to designated offshore sites, where their progress will be closely monitored. This initiative aims to identify resilient coral strains that can better withstand future environmental stressors and contribute to the recovery of the vital reef ecosystem.</p>

Other stories highlight the service of individuals like Pfc. John Francis Rys, a paratrooper killed in action during World War II, and Navy Lt. Theodore King Higgins, who died in a plane crash during the Vietnam War, illustrating the diverse experiences and profound impact of military service on families across the United States.</p>

          <h2>Research Links Tooth Sensitivity to Ancient Armored Fish</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues discovered that the anatomy of these ancient fish scales is remarkably similar to that of vertebrate teeth. This suggests that the ability to sense pressure and temperature, which causes toothaches, evolved from the sensory structures in the armor of these early fish. The finding sheds light on the evolutionary origins of our skeletons and explains why we experience tooth sensitivity.</p>

          <p>A cargo vessel, the Stena Immaculate, which was involved in a collision in the North Sea, has donated a large quantity of food to food banks in Norfolk. The vessel, docked at the Port of Great Yarmouth, provided frozen meat and fish to the St Mary Magdalene Church food bank. The donation, described as one of the "craziest" ever received, will sustain the church's food bank for several months. This act of generosity provides a positive outcome from the unfortunate incident involving the ship.</p>

          <h2>Why Japan's Gen Z is 'Quiet Quitting' Work</h2>

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, they are content with doing the bare minimum and leaving work on time. This shift reflects a desire for more personal time and a rejection of the intense demands placed on workers by corporate Japan. The trend also highlights concerns about job security, stagnant wages, and the sacrifices made by previous generations.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Beat Mets in 13 Innings Amid Pitching Staff Challenges</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in a 13-inning marathon, but the victory was overshadowed by concerns about their already depleted pitching staff. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was forced to cover 11 innings. Despite the challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hern√°ndez delivering a key RBI double in the 13th. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the strain on the pitching staff and the need to carefully manage their workload in the coming days.</p>
