          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack addressed the U.S. economic outlook, discussing the potential for future interest rate cuts in light of persistent inflation. Her comments on CNBC followed stronger-than-expected economic data, which has led investors to temper their expectations for rapid monetary easing from the central bank. While the Fed recently approved a quarter-point rate cut and signaled more could follow, the robust data suggests a more cautious approach may be warranted moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was unsuccessful in its bid to win mayoral offices in three major cities during runoff elections in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Candidates from the center-left SPD and center-right CDU defeated their AfD opponents in Gelsenkirchen, Duisburg, and Hagen. However, preliminary results show the AfD nearly tripled its share of votes in local councils to 14.5%, making it the third-strongest party in the region and indicating its growing influence despite the mayoral losses.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new government initiative aimed at abolishing long-term youth unemployment by offering guaranteed paid work placements. Under the plan, every young person who has been out of work or education for 18 months will be offered a placement, and those who refuse without a valid reason could face benefit sanctions. The scheme, which builds on an existing "youth guarantee," will be funded from current budgets and implemented in partnership with private sector companies.</p>

          <p>As health officials warn of a seasonal rise in respiratory illnesses, this article provides guidance on how to differentiate between the symptoms of flu and COVID-19. While both viruses share features, the flu often begins suddenly with fever, aches, and exhaustion, whereas many recent COVID-19 cases present with cold-like symptoms, with a hoarse throat becoming a hallmark of new variants. Officials stress that vaccination for both viruses remains the most effective defense for preventing severe illness and protecting vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Moldovan President Maia Sandu's pro-European party is heading for a decisive victory in parliamentary elections, securing a new majority to continue the country's path toward the EU. The election was overshadowed by Sandu's warnings of "massive Russian interference," including disinformation campaigns and vote-buying schemes aimed at destabilizing the vote. The result reinforces Moldova's Western trajectory in a region heavily influenced by Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine and domestic pro-Moscow political forces.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police is consulting on a proposal to require its officers and staff to declare membership in the Freemasons. This potential policy change follows a recommendation from the independent panel investigating the unsolved 1987 murder of Daniel Morgan, which found that police membership in the secretive fraternity had been a recurring source of suspicion and mistrust. The force acknowledged that concerns have been raised about how such associations could impact impartiality in investigations, promotions, and misconduct cases.</p>

          <p>Investment bank Goldman Sachs has forecasted that China's central bank is likely to cut interest rates and ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter of the year. This prediction comes as the country's economic momentum slows and policymakers face increasing pressure to provide support for growth. The forecast suggests a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, though analysts note the decision will be data-dependent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American shopping malls, marked by increasing vacancy rates as national chains close stores, is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses. Landlords, eager to keep their properties active, are now more willing to negotiate favorable terms, such as lower rents and flexible leases, that were previously out of reach for smaller enterprises. This trend is allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and other local service providers to move into prime commercial spaces once exclusively occupied by major brands.</p>
