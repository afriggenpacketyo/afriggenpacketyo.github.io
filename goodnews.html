          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that economic conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, emphasizing a careful approach due to high uncertainty. In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell noted shifting risks between full employment and stable prices, citing "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he highlighted rising downside dangers and the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and political independence amidst external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nuno Espirito Santo's position as Nottingham Forest manager is uncertain due to a breakdown in his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Despite achieving European qualification last season and an opening-day win, sources indicate Nuno's job is not entirely secure, with the playing squad reportedly aware of the tension. Nuno himself stated their relationship "has changed" and they are "not as close" as last season. Suggestions that Nuno has not been fully involved in the club's summer recruitment are believed to be a contributing factor to the deteriorating dynamic.</p>

          <p>Over 100 business leaders are urging the UK government to create a standalone offense for assaulting any public-facing worker, extending beyond the proposed retail worker protection. A survey by the Institute of Customer Service reveals that 43% of customer-facing employees experienced hostility in the past six months, a 20% increase year-on-year. This rise is causing 37% of workers to consider leaving their jobs, highlighting a significant need for stronger legal deterrents. The Home Office supports police powers but has focused its new offense on retail staff.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian, which published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The judge dismissed Clarke's claim, finding the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment stated the meaning of the articles was "substantially true" and found Clarke "not a credible or reliable witness," rejecting his conspiracy claim. The Guardian's editor hailed the decision as a "deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a landmark for investigative journalism, while Clarke expressed disappointment.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments is undertaking a $60 billion manufacturing megaproject in the U.S., where Apple has committed to producing "critical foundation semiconductors" for its devices. This initiative involves seven new fabs across Utah and Texas, aiming to significantly boost domestic chip production for major customers. Despite a recent stock dip due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts view TI as a potential "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundry. The project represents a substantial bet on reshoring chip manufacturing and regaining market share in essential components. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham's head coach Thomas Frank stated the club is only interested in signing players fully committed to wearing their badge, following the loss of Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze to rivals Arsenal. Spurs had been confident of acquiring Eze, but he ultimately chose Arsenal in a £67.5m deal. This marks the second transfer blow for Tottenham this summer, after Morgan Gibbs-White opted to sign a new contract with Nottingham Forest. Frank's comments underscore a clear message about player loyalty and club philosophy in the competitive transfer market.</p>

          <p>John Deere is at a crossroads, facing significantly softer demand in the agricultural sector, leading to decreased net income and recent layoffs across its U.S. factories. Farmers are cutting spending due to lower crop prices and rising costs, directly impacting equipment sales. Despite these headwinds, Deere remains confident in its future, citing growth in European and South American markets and committing $20 billion to U.S. manufacturing over the next decade.

          <p>As the U.S. under President Trump retreats from clean energy investments, Chinese cleantech firms are aggressively expanding into emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America. Trump labeled wind and solar power "the scam of the century," signaling a decline in U.S. commitment. Chinese companies are deepening their influence through "tech diplomacy," embedding proprietary technologies into local supply chains and promoting their technical standards. This strategic push positions China as a global hub for clean energy, contrasting sharply with the U.S. withdrawal.</p>
