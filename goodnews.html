          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases beyond April of next year, but at a slower pace than initially planned, while keeping its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5%. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with the total amount of purchases declining to about 2 trillion yen in early 2027. This decision reflects the BOJ's cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties, especially concerning potential impacts from U.S. trade policies. The BOJ aims to balance reducing its balance sheet with supporting economic stability.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his return to the MLB mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching for the first time since August 2023, and contributed two RBIs in a 6-3 win against the San Diego Padres.

The Dodgers' bullpen effectively held the Padres to secure the victory, marking a successful comeback for Ohtani.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing portions of a tariff agreement reached last month. The deal, announced at the G7 summit, includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and does not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The order allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year, and removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. While some tariffs remain, the agreement is viewed as a positive step for UK businesses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the dismissal of one juror and concerns about another in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial, legal expert David S. Seltzer suggests that sequestering the jury from the trial's outset could have prevented these issues. Seltzer argues that jury problems arise when jurors discuss case facts outside the jury's presence, violating court instructions. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani emphasized that jurors must adhere to court rules or face removal. The concerns stem from possible communications between a juror and a former colleague regarding jury service, highlighting the challenges in maintaining an impartial jury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like Treasurys, the yen, and the Swiss franc, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute this to gold's independence from government liabilities. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have fueled gold's demand. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced a sell-off after tariff rollouts and credit rating downgrades, compromising their safe-haven status. Gold's appeal lies in its stability amidst volatile policymaking and unchecked debt growth.</p>
