          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a victory over Amanda Serrano for the third time, concluding their historic trilogy with a majority decision win at Madison Square Garden. The bout, held during the first-ever all-female card at the iconic venue, was a tactical and gripping contest, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. Unlike their more contentious previous encounters, this verdict was largely undisputed, as Taylor employed a smarter, more economical boxing style. Serrano acknowledged that her strategic shift to fight from a distance did not pay off against the 39-year-old undisputed light-welterweight champion.</p>

          <p>A fugitive named Sedrick T. Stevenson, who escaped from custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office reported a multi-agency effort involving U.S. Marshals and Seattle-area police ensured his secure return after more than a month on the run. Photos released by the sheriff's office showed a smiling Stevenson on the plane, heavily secured and monitored by law enforcement. Stevenson was originally wanted on multiple charges, including being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and assault, before his initial escape from a contracted agent at the airport's ticket counter.</p>

          <h2>Google Hires CEO and Top Talent from AI Startup Windsurf in $2.4 Billion Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 23:31:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the competitive AI talent landscape by hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of his team. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, primarily consists of licensing fees for certain Windsurf technology and compensation for the new hires, rather than an acquisition of the company itself. This strategic talent acquisition allows Google DeepMind to bolster its work in agentic coding and the Gemini platform. The move underscores the intense 'talent war' among major tech companies, with firms like Google, Microsoft, and Meta increasingly making high-value deals to secure top AI researchers and developers.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted after Prada presented the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its cultural origins, prompting a social media outcry and a formal request for recognition from a Maharashtra trade chamber representing artisans. In response, Prada held a meeting to discuss future collaborations, with Lorenzo Bertelli, head of corporate social responsibility, participating. This move is seen as a step towards respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities, which are now seeking to patent the design.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to halt certain types of immigration raids in Los Angeles and several other Southern California counties. U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's ruling came in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU and other rights groups, which alleged that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting people based on race and denying legal counsel. The order specifically bars agents from making detentive stops based solely on factors like a person's apparent ethnicity, accent, or presence at specific locations like day labor sites without reasonable suspicion. The judge also criticized the administration, stating there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims of constitutional violations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create and sell AI-generated voice clones without their consent after hiring them for what was described as internal or academic work. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their work as training data will proceed. This decision is considered a significant victory for artists seeking to hold AI companies accountable for the unauthorized use of their work.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their international presence, responding to a growing demand from Chinese companies operating abroad and encouragement from Beijing. The number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms has reportedly increased by 70% since 2018, as these companies often prefer to seek legal support from trusted domestic lawyers for their global operations. While they are successfully serving their compatriots, the article notes that winning over non-Chinese clients remains a challenge, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions. This expansion reflects a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry as it adapts to the country's increasing global economic footprint and the changing needs of its corporations.</p>

          <p>The Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport in Michigan has secured a significant airport improvement grant of over $14 million from the Federal Aviation Administration. According to airport officials, the funds will be used to support several key infrastructure projects, including the relocation of a runway lighting system and extensive runway construction. The airport director stated that the grant will enable a runway extension designed to enhance safety, reduce flight delays and cancellations, and minimize weight restrictions on flights. Construction for these vital improvements is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026 and is expected to be completed by the fall of that year.</p>

          <p>As the global market for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is projected to reach $150 billion, dozens of Chinese pharmaceutical companies are developing rival medications. With the patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, analysts predict that cheaper generic versions will soon flood the market. Currently, up to 60 similar drugs are reportedly in trial phases in China, with as many as 20 generic manufacturers expected to compete for market share. This increased competition is anticipated to significantly lower prices, making these treatments more accessible to a wider range of patients struggling with obesity and related health issues.</p>

          <p>A major terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in port activity linked to global trade uncertainties and rising tariffs. The project by International Transportation Service (ITS) aims to extend the quay and fill in a 19-acre water area, boosting cargo-handling capacity by 50% and allowing larger ships to dock. While officials acknowledge the current uncertainty in the industry, which has seen a drop in container movement, they express confidence in the port's long-term growth. The expansion is seen as a crucial investment in strengthening America's supply chain infrastructure for the future.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of the infamous former Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors accused Guzman Lopez, known as "El Raton," of taking over a leadership role in the Sinaloa Cartel following his father's arrest and extradition. As part of his plea deal, he admitted to coordinating the transport of vast quantities of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl into the U.S. and agreed to forfeit $80 million. In exchange for his full cooperation, he will receive a reduced sentence, marking a significant development in U.S. efforts to dismantle the powerful cartel.</p>

          <p>A decade after its initial release, the song "The Night We Met" by indie folk band Lord Huron has become a massive and unlikely global hit, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify alone. Originally the final track on their 2015 album "Strange Trails," the song gained a second life after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and subsequently exploding in popularity on TikTok. Its slow-burning success is unusual for a track that was not a hit upon release, with its streaming numbers continuing to grow each year. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes its enduring appeal to its relatable, wistful lyrics about a soured relationship, which allows listeners to insert their own stories.</p>

          <p>A veteran analyst from Piper Sandler has issued a notably bullish forecast for Microsoft, raising the company's stock price target to an eye-popping $600 per share. This optimism is primarily fueled by the sustained and accelerating dominance of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which continues to gain market share from competitors like Amazon Web Services. The upgrade is supported by survey data indicating a record number of chief information officers intend to increase their spending on Azure, alongside strong growth in the company's overall cloud revenue and commercial bookings. The report highlights how AI workloads are significantly contributing to this powerful financial performance (not investment advice).</p>
