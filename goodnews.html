          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. experienced a significant surge after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson recommended the stock. Jackson, known for his influence on Opendoor's trading explosion, referred to the company as "the Shopify of mortgages" and highlighted its potential for massive growth, driven by its use of artificial intelligence to innovate the mortgage industry. He contrasted its low valuation with that of newly public blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions, suggesting Better Home is undervalued despite its faster growth rate.

Features like optical character recognition allow the glasses to read text from signs, menus, and mail, providing crucial access to information. While advocates acknowledge the technology is still a work in progress with limitations like battery life, they see it as a significant step forward in accessibility.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official has confirmed that the preliminary deal to maintain TikTok's U.S. operations will not include the federal government taking an equity stake or a "golden share." This structure differs from previous government interventions in companies like U.S. Steel. The agreement will establish TikTok's American business as a new joint venture with a U.S.-majority board of directors, and tech giant Oracle will be responsible for overseeing its security operations. The deal addresses national security concerns that led to a bipartisan law requiring its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest or face a ban.</p>

The shaking was widely felt across the region, with over 22,000 residents reporting the event to the United States Geological Survey. While the quake caused widespread alarm and prompted temporary transit delays for safety inspections, authorities reported no significant damage or injuries. San Francisco's Department of Emergency Management confirmed an increase in calls but stated first responders were assessing the city for any potential impact.</p>

          <p>Germany's national railway operator, Deutsche Bahn, has appointed Evelyn Palla as its new CEO to address a long-standing crisis of delays, cancellations, and deteriorating infrastructure. Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder acknowledged the system's dysfunction, setting a more realistic punctuality target of 70% by 2029, a significant adjustment from previous goals. Palla, who previously managed the company's more successful regional transport division, will oversee a massive, multi-billion euro renovation plan for key routes. The government plans to inject substantial funds from a special infrastructure fund to modernize the dilapidated network, parts of which date back to the 19th century.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire, UK, faced a potential cancellation due to a shortage of suitable conkers caused by the record-breaking hot and dry summer. The weather caused horse chestnuts to fall from trees prematurely and undersized, prompting a nationwide appeal for donations. In response, offers to supply conkers have come from across the country, making organizers confident the event will proceed as scheduled. To preserve the local supply, some conkers have been frozen and stored in water, though they are expected to be smaller than average this year.</p>

          <p>Despite reports that the Trump administration may announce a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism, many leading medical experts and organizations assert that current scientific evidence does not support a causal relationship. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated there is no clear proof and warned against frightening pregnant patients away from one of the few safe pain relief options available to them. While some smaller studies have suggested a possible association, larger and more robust research, including a study of 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no increased risk of autism.</p>

The company plans to offer approximately 3.7 million shares, which would value it at around $366 million at the high end of its price range. This IPO is seen as a test of investor appetite in a market where many lenders have opted for private capital or mergers over public listings due to stricter regulations.

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has recently employed a surprisingly defensive tactical approach, culminating in a draw against Arsenal where his team registered just 34% possession, a record low for any side he has managed. This shift away from his signature possession-based style has raised questions about whether he is adapting to a more cautious trend in top-level football or if he lacks trust in his current squad's ability to control games. The move is a radical departure from his established philosophy, which has historically focused on dominating the ball to create attacking opportunities. This tactical evolution is being closely watched as title rivals Liverpool currently lead the league with a more aggressive, high-scoring style.</p>

Musalem, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, stated that the current policy stance is appropriate, balancing risks to the labor market and inflation. His comments reflect a divide within the committee, where a slight majority sees the need for at least two more rate cuts this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The rapid collapse of the government has led to speculation about external involvement, though many observers attribute it to widespread domestic frustration over a lack of opportunities and cronyism. The political shift is being closely watched by regional and global powers, including India, China, and the United States, all of whom have significant strategic interests in the Himalayan nation.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant rise in "solopreneurs," with nearly 30 million one-person businesses contributing $1.7 trillion to the national economy. This trend, accelerated by the pandemic, is fueled by lowered barriers to entry thanks to artificial intelligence and the direct consumer access provided by social media platforms like TikTok. Experts note that AI can serve as a virtual assistant and business planner, while social media allows entrepreneurs to build a customer base with unprecedented speed and minimal cost. This shift also reflects a growing desire among workers for greater flexibility, autonomy, and purpose outside of traditional corporate career paths.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning a cycle of interest rate cuts, financial experts are advising savers that the era of high returns on cash accounts is ending. The recent quarter-point reduction is expected to be followed by more, which will lower the yields on high-yield savings and money market accounts. Certified financial planners suggest that now may be an opportune time for savers to lock in currently available higher rates by using certificates of deposit (CDs). By laddering CDs with various maturity dates, individuals can secure better returns for a set period while still maintaining liquidity for emergency funds in standard savings accounts.

While the Fed's actions do not directly control mortgage rates, which are tied more closely to the 10-year Treasury yield, the cooling economy and shifting job market are expected to push rates slightly lower. Experts forecast that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages could settle in the 6.0-6.2% range.

Another approach reframes the interaction by asking for support instead of solutions, which can be more effective in personal situations.

The selections range from historical accounts like Tom Holland's "Rubicon," which details the decay of the Roman Republic, to foundational philosophy in Aristotle's "Politics." The list also includes modern investigations such as Jane Mayer's "Dark Money," which examines campaign finance, and Sarah Chayes's "Thieves of State," on how kleptocracy fuels global insecurity. Together, these books provide a comprehensive look at how corruption is justified, how it functions, and its devastating long-term effects on society.</p>
