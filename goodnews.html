          <p>Davey Johnson, a celebrated figure in Major League Baseball, has passed away at the age of 82. Johnson was a four-time All-Star infielder and a two-time World Series champion with the Baltimore Orioles during his playing career. He is most famously remembered for managing the 1986 New York Mets to a World Series title, and his .588 winning percentage remains the best in Mets franchise history.

          <p>The European Union is set to introduce its new Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, a digital process for tracking non-EU citizens crossing into the 29-country Schengen Area. The system will replace manual passport stamping and require travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first entry. While the goal is to enhance security and streamline travel, officials have raised concerns about potential for long queues at major transit points during the initial rollout.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the tournament quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia. Despite the lopsided score, the performance was uncharacteristically sloppy, particularly in the first half when England struggled to execute their typically dominant driving maul. While the team's defense remained strong, keeping Australia scoreless after the interval, the untidy aspects of their play may offer encouragement to stronger opponents in the upcoming knockout stages.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, serves as a key example of the league's ambitious global strategy. Rather than staging one-off events, the NFL is focused on building a year-round, long-term presence in international markets to grow its fanbase. This approach includes media deals with major local broadcasters like Brazil's Globo and encouraging teams to engage directly with fans in their assigned markets. The league aims to establish American football as a true global sport property.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen set a new Formula 1 record for the fastest lap in the sport's history while securing pole position at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. His average speed of 164.466 mph broke the previous record held by Lewis Hamilton since 2020. The new benchmark was made possible by a combination of factors, including the current cars' high straight-line speed, a recently resurfaced track providing more grip, and Monza's legendary high-speed layout.</p>

The test aims to ensure the system's reliability after a previous trial in 2023 revealed some technical glitches that officials hope have since been resolved.</p>
