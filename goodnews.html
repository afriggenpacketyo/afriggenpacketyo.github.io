          <p>California's Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing significant changes to the state's healthcare program for undocumented immigrants due to budget constraints. The proposed changes include charging monthly premiums and halting new enrollments as early as January. These measures are part of a broader effort to address a budget shortfall, reflecting the challenges of balancing state resources with healthcare accessibility. The governor's plan highlights the ongoing debate surrounding healthcare for undocumented immigrants and the financial considerations involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are crafting a tax bill that includes temporary tax cuts, such as an increase to the child tax credit and a bonus to the standard deduction, set to expire at the end of 2028, just before President Trump's term ends. This strategy allows Republicans to avoid accounting for the long-term costs of the cuts, hoping they will become popular enough to be extended later. While some provisions, like lower individual income rates, would be permanent, the temporary nature of many cuts may reduce their impact on economic growth, and the bill includes new limits on qualifying for the child tax credit. The bill also includes spending cuts to programs like Medicaid, potentially offsetting any gains from the tax cuts for low-income Americans.</p>

This decision comes as the company's streaming business has improved its profitability and aims to reach over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026, mirroring a similar strategy taken by Disney, which is focusing on quality content to succeed in the streaming market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the immediate release of Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, after he was detained for two months in an immigration facility in Texas. Judge Patricia Giles ruled that the government failed to provide evidence that Suri posed a national security threat and that his detention violated the First Amendment. The judge emphasized the need to disrupt the chilling effect of his detention on others critical of Israel, noting that Suri's arrest appeared punitive. The case has drawn significant attention, with supporters crowding the courthouse to follow the proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the U.S., but the article explores the underlying reasons for high drug costs. Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries, largely due to the lack of universal healthcare and limited negotiation power. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), intended to control drug prices, have been criticized for benefiting from inflated costs. While Trump's executive order may face legal challenges, Congress would need to act to truly change drug price negotiations, and pharmaceutical companies oppose lower prices, arguing it will affect innovation.

          <p>Borrowers should be proactive in pursuing debt consolidation, as waiting for interest rates to drop significantly is not a viable strategy. Shopping for lenders to compare rates and exploring debt relief companies for expertise are crucial steps. Considering alternatives like HELOCs or home equity loans may offer lower interest rates. By taking initiative and exploring all options, borrowers can improve their financial footing and work toward regaining financial freedom.</p>
