          <p>President Trump refuted claims that his tariff strategies are a form of backing down, dismissing the term "Trump Always Chickens Out" (TACO trade). He asserted that his tariff threats have been instrumental in jumpstarting trade negotiations with the European Union, pointing to their willingness to meet after he announced potential tariffs. Trump defended his approach as a negotiation tactic, highlighting the delay of tariffs on the EU as a strategic move rather than a retreat. He criticized the initial question about his trade policies as "nasty," maintaining that his actions have helped the U.S. gain ground in trade discussions.</p>

          <p>A two-ton elephant seal wandered into a residential area in Gordon's Bay, South Africa, surprising residents and prompting a rescue operation. The seal, identified as a young male, was contained by police and a local security company before animal welfare officials intervened. Worried about the seal's distance from the ocean and potential dehydration, specialists sedated and transported him back to a nearby bay.

This comes amid tensions with the U.S. and threats from President Trump, though Carney has also expressed openness to joining a missile defence project proposed by Trump. Canada's defence minister emphasized the need to boost defence capacity due to global threats, particularly in the Arctic. The King's throne speech also highlighted commitments to strengthen defence relationships with European allies and mentioned joining the ReArm Europe plan.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is proposing a new strategy to increase EU influence in the Black Sea region, aiming to counter Russian influence through closer collaboration with neighboring countries. A key component of this strategy is the establishment of a "maritime security hub" to enhance situational awareness, information sharing, and early warning of potential threats. This hub would monitor critical undersea infrastructure and shipping, including those potentially helping Russia circumvent EU sanctions. The plan seeks to build on existing trade, energy, and transport cooperation, but details regarding the hub's location, participating countries, and financial resources remain unclear.</p>

His comments come as Republicans push for the GENIUS Act, legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins, which has faced some Democratic opposition.

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed barriers on including cryptocurrency and related digital assets in 401(k) plans by rescinding guidance from the Biden-era Labor Department. The previous guidance cautioned employers about the risks of exposing retirement savings to crypto assets. This move signals a potential shift towards a more accommodating stance on digital assets in retirement plans, but employers still retain a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of 401(k) investors.

          <p>Toyota Motor is aiming for substantial growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), planning to increase their share of U.S. sales from 2.4% to roughly 20% by 2030. This strategy comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, despite the company's ongoing investments in EV technology. Toyota believes PHEVs offer a practical steppingstone for consumers hesitant to fully commit to electric vehicles, while also helping automakers meet fuel economy and emissions standards. The company plans to expand its PHEV lineup, focusing on where it can build them and how they compare to competitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that domestic cats can differentiate between the scent of their owner and that of a stranger. Researchers found that cats spent significantly more time sniffing tubes containing the odors of unknown people compared to tubes containing their owner's smell. This indicates that cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odour, but it remains unclear whether they can identify specific individuals. The study also found that cat personality influences how they interact with odors.</p>

          <p>A study by researchers at the Tokyo University of Agriculture found that cats use scent to distinguish their owners from strangers. The cats spent twice as long smelling samples from strangers than samples from their owners, and they favored their right nostrils over their left nostrils when sniffing the swabs from strangers. The researchers said that while their findings suggested a cat's sense of smell was a tool for their recognizing humans, they could not conclude that smell was the most important mechanism for cats to do that. Personality traits may also play a role in how cats interact with odors.</p>
