          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a major, long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, boosting its foundry business. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, does not name the client due to a confidentiality agreement, sparking speculation that it could be a major tech firm like Qualcomm or Tesla. This agreement is a significant development for Samsung as it competes with TSMC and aims to ramp up production of its next-generation 2-nanometer chips, especially after recent struggles to meet AI-related demand.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal on tariffs, establishing a 15% rate for most EU goods, which is lower than the threatened 30% but higher than previous levels. The agreement is being presented as a significant win for the Trump administration, which also secured commitments for the EU to purchase billions in US energy and arms. For the EU, the deal removes significant economic uncertainty, even though it represents a major concession, particularly with a 50% tariff remaining on steel and aluminum exports to the US.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have introduced new rules mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that individuals and units should not be punished or have their future funding prospects affected if failures are due to reasonable issues like technical difficulties or market changes, and not misconduct. This move is designed to encourage bold exploration in uncharted scientific territories and foster a culture that is more tolerant of the risks inherent in groundbreaking research.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a trade deal between the US and the European Union, European leaders have expressed a mix of relief and caution. The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, averts a threatened 30% rate but is still viewed as a significant compromise. Leaders from Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands welcomed the stability the deal provides, though they acknowledged that a no-tariff scenario would have been preferable, highlighting the difficult concessions made to avoid a wider trade war with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The ancient village of Keeladi in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has become the center of a historical and political battle following significant archaeological discoveries. Excavations have unearthed a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts suggesting a literate society that predates or developed independently of the dominant narrative of northern Indian civilization. These findings have ignited Tamil pride and challenged established historical timelines, turning the site into a symbol of the deep-rooted cultural and political divide between India's north and south.</p>

          <p>A profile of comedian John Oliver explores his journey from the Edinburgh Fringe festival to becoming one of America's most influential satirists with his HBO show "Last Week Tonight." Oliver explains that his goal is to make people laugh about serious topics he cares about, using meticulously researched deep dives into obscure and complex issues like hospice care or nuclear annihilation. He views his criticism of the U.S. not as a sign of dislike for his adopted homeland, but as an expression of love and a desire to see it improve.</p>

          <p>An investigation by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully located a Skyvan PA-51 aircraft used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where prisoners were thrown alive into the Atlantic. By tracking the plane to the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs, they provided crucial, documented evidence of these atrocities. This evidence was instrumental in a landmark 2017 trial that convicted dozens of officials for crimes against humanity, and the plane has since been returned to Argentina as a memorial.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting a quarterly beat and raising its guidance, Honeywell's stock experienced a significant drop, a trend that has frustrated some market watchers this earnings season. The conglomerate is in the process of a complex split into three separate companies, a factor that may be creating "spin purgatory" and investor impatience. An analyst suggests the sell-off is an overreaction, arguing that the company is well-positioned for the reindustrialization of America and that the current discouragement presents a buying opportunity for those with conviction in its long-term value.
