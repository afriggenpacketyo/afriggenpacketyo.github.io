          <p>Facing increasing trade pressures and regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., Temu and Shein are shifting their focus to Europe and the U.K. as key growth markets. However, they are encountering similar regulatory headwinds, including a proposed ‚Ç¨2 customs fee on small packages, which could significantly impact their business model. Data indicates a slowdown in U.S. consumer spending on these platforms, with some customers shifting to traditional retailers, while spending in Europe and the U.K. is increasing. These challenges highlight the need for Temu and Shein to adapt to stricter regulations on product safety and consumer protection in the European market.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning summit talks between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada, on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator is expected to visit Washington for further negotiations on Trump's tariffs. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced rates as the U.S. has resisted eliminating the duties. Both countries aim to reach a deal to boost investment and create jobs in the United States, while also addressing Trump's goal of reducing the trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II due to a serious health risk. Cans labeled "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar, approximately 39 grams, which poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid or monitor sugar intake, particularly those with diabetes. The affected cans were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, with a "best by" date of February 16, 2026.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to lower the elevated prices of rice. The release will include rice from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarket operators, specialty shops, and major retailers. The government hopes this action will alleviate public frustration over the high cost of rice.</p>

The lawsuit argues that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without express, informed consent.

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a report warning of an "unprecedented decline" in world fertility rates, with millions unable to have their desired number of children due to financial limitations and lack of suitable partners. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries found that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The UNFPA emphasizes the prohibitive cost of parenthood as a major factor, with financial limitations cited by 39% of respondents. This marks a significant shift in the UN's focus towards addressing issues related to low fertility.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have decreased significantly, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, and safer drug choices among teens and young adults. However, some groups are still at risk, and proposed cuts to funding for addiction services could reverse this progress. The trend indicates a shift towards less risky drug use and increased awareness of the dangers of fentanyl.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution asserted its independence by stating that it, not President Trump, controls personnel decisions, including that of the National Portrait Gallery director, Kim Sajet. The statement, which followed a Board of Regents meeting, emphasized the authority of the Smithsonian's secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, in managing the institution. The move comes after Trump announced Sajet's firing on social media, citing her support for DEI initiatives. The Smithsonian's statement underscores its commitment to being a nonpartisan institution and a welcoming place of knowledge for all Americans.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while the company's Ascend chips lag behind US counterparts by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through tactics like stacking and clustering. Ren highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large youth population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. His comments suggest that US sanctions have not completely halted China's technological advancements. Ren's comments come as the US Department of Commerce published new guidance saying the use of Ascend chips "anywhere in the world" could be interpreted as a violation of American export controls.</p>
