          <p>At 45, Venus Williams continues to compete on the professional tennis tour, a striking contrast to her younger sister Serena's retirement. Following a quarter-final doubles loss at the US Open, this article reflects on her late-career stage, where the focus has shifted from winning Grand Slams to savoring her continued love for the game. Despite diminished power and struggles with an autoimmune disorder, Williams maintains her classic grace and a determination to play on her own terms. Her persistence serves as an inspiration, raising questions not of if she can win, but how much longer she can extend her legendary career.</p>

          <h2>Historical Portrayal of Children in Art Reflects Evolving Societal Views</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 08:41:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An exploration of art history reveals how the depiction of children has transformed over centuries, mirroring societal shifts in their roles and value. In early modern Europe, portraits of royal children were political tools for marriage alliances, presenting them as idealized assets. As the bourgeoisie rose, their children were also painted in opulent styles, often in mythological costumes to symbolize virtues. This article traces the evolution from depicting children as religious icons or miniature adults to later, more modern concepts of a carefree childhood, a phase that only became widely accepted in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

          <p>While sidelined with a groin injury, Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was involved in a fiery verbal exchange with Phoenix Mercury's DeWanna Bonner during a game. The confrontation occurred as Bonner was walking toward her bench, with a black-clad Clark stepping forward from the Fever's sideline to engage her. The two players, who had a previous on-court spat during last season's playoffs, had to be separated by teammates. Bonner briefly played for the Fever this season before being released and rejoining Phoenix, where she has spent most of her career.</p>

          <p>Macy's shares jumped 10% after the department store retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year financial outlook.

CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, stating that while tariffs remain a factor, the company is well-positioned with a healthy inventory and growth across its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury brands.

          <p>A theft charge against a man accused of stealing flowers from public tributes to the late Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham has been withdrawn. Prosecutors dropped the case against Parviz Jafari after it was revealed that a security guard had given him permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of a conviction because it could not be proven that his actions were dishonest. Thousands of tributes were left for the Black Sabbath frontman following his death in July at the age of 76.</p>

The 29-year-old, who was part of the 2018 World Cup squad, fell out of contention after a severe Achilles rupture in 2019 while at Chelsea. His successful move to Italian club AC Milan has revived his career and earned him a recall to the squad under manager Thomas Tuchel, with whom he previously worked at Chelsea.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley are predicting a significant improvement for China's struggling property market in the latter half of the year. Following a difficult first half, the report suggests that sales and profitability for major developers will decline at a much slower pace, with the potential for a sales pickup in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on an expected recovery in development margins and rental income growth, as well as a rich supply of completed homes in higher-tier cities. The forecast contrasts sharply with the weak interim results recently reported by the country's largest developers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times makes a bold prediction that the Rams will play in this season's Super Bowl. The author argues that despite concerns over quarterback Matthew Stafford's health and the offensive line, the team is exceptionally talented. Key factors cited for this optimism include the acquisition of star receiver Davante Adams, a strengthened offensive line with the return of center Coleman Shelton, and a formidable young defense. Combined with the coaching of Sean McVay and a relatively favorable schedule, the columnist contends the team has all the necessary components for a deep playoff run.</p>

The study found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to lower percentages for unmarried women and married women without children. These women also reported the highest levels of life purpose and meaning. The author suggests that while motherhood presents challenges like feeling overwhelmed, it provides a profound sense of purpose that contributes significantly to overall life satisfaction.</p>
