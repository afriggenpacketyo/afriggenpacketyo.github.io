          <p>Top NBA draft pick Cooper Flagg made a notable debut in the Las Vegas Summer League, showcasing the skills that have made him one of the most anticipated prospects in years. Despite a self-described poor shooting performance in his first game, the 18-year-old phenom still displayed his defensive and playmaking abilities before scoring 31 points in his second appearance. Drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, Flagg is known for his intense work ethic and a focus on winning, drawing comparisons to NBA stars like Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum. Insiders praise his maturity and dedication, with some viewing him as the most complete teenage player since LeBron James.</p>

          <p>A husband-and-wife team of archaeologists from the University of Houston has discovered a 4th-century Mayan royal tomb at the Caracol site in Belize. The tomb is believed to belong to Te' K’ab Chaak, the earliest known ruler of the major Mayan city and the founder of its dynasty. Inside, the researchers found a wealth of priceless artifacts, including a jadeite death mask, numerous pottery vessels, and jewelry, all of which provide invaluable insight into the ancient culture. The discovery is the first confirmed royal tomb found at the site, marking a significant milestone in the decades-long study of Caracol.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, holding the group responsible for the deadly April attack in Pahalgam, India, that killed 26 people. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is already a UN-designated terrorist group. The Indian government welcomed the decision, calling it a strong affirmation of U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. The designation is seen by experts as a significant sign of American support for India following the attack, which targeted mostly Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Vice President, Hsiao Bi-khim, stated that Taiwan does not seek conflict and will not provoke a confrontation with China, while criticizing Beijing's "aggressive" military actions as counterproductive. Speaking in Taipei, she reiterated President Lai Ching-te's offer for talks and emphasized that defending the status quo is a responsible choice for regional stability. Hsiao highlighted that the peaceful environment has allowed for decades of Taiwanese contributions to China's prosperity. She also mentioned that Taiwan is actively negotiating with the U.S. to resolve a trade dispute over a proposed 32% tariff on its goods.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight from Omaha to Detroit was forced to make an emergency landing in Cedar Rapids, Michigan, after a passenger became unruly and attempted to open an emergency exit door. Air traffic control audio captured the pilot reporting that the passenger was fighting with a flight attendant. Upon landing, law enforcement arrested 23-year-old Mario Nikprelaj of Nebraska. He now faces multiple charges, including disorderly conduct, assault, and harassment, with the possibility of additional federal charges pending investigation. The flight, with 67 passengers and four crew members, later continued safely to its destination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original series for the first time, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos. The technology was employed in the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts" to produce a scene of a building collapsing, a sequence that was completed ten times faster and at a much lower cost than with traditional methods. While Sarandos praised the technology for making advanced effects accessible to smaller-budget productions, its use remains controversial in Hollywood over concerns about job displacement and copyright infringement, which were central issues in the 2023 actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The space technology sector saw a significant surge in investment, with startups raising $3.1 billion in the second quarter, marking a substantial increase from the previous period. According to a report from Seraphim Space, this rally was driven by sustained interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment. U.S. firms dominated the funding landscape, attracting 70% of the capital, with year-to-date investment already surpassing the total for all of 2024. The report highlights strong momentum for companies involved in crewed space stations, on-orbit servicing, and energy generation, signaling robust confidence in the sector's growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the heat-detecting abilities of the fire beetle. This innovative technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, offering significant potential for military and industrial applications. The fire beetle possesses a unique organ that allows it to sense faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away, an evolutionary trait used for finding ideal locations for reproduction. This biological marvel has provided a blueprint for creating highly sensitive optoelectronic devices that can operate effectively in challenging conditions like smoke or dust.</p>

          <p>Israel's stock market has demonstrated remarkable resilience, reaching a record high and outperforming other Middle Eastern markets despite ongoing multi-front wars. After an initial 23% drop following the October 7th attack, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) rebounded and has since surged significantly. This economic buoyancy is attributed to strong foreign investment, renewed investor confidence, and the strength of its high-tech sector, which constitutes 20% of the country's GDP. The OECD has forecast strong growth for Israel's economy in 2026, reflecting a positive long-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has become a local inventor and celebrity after successfully building and operating his own seven-metre-long submarine. The man, identified only as Zhang, said he was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to pursue his childhood dream of building machines. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black submarine, has been seen slicing through a local river, astonishing villagers and demonstrating a remarkable feat of grassroots ingenuity and determination.</p>
