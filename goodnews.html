          <p>China is spearheading the construction of the International Meridian Circle Programme (IMCP), a comprehensive ground-based space weather monitoring and warning network. This ambitious project aims to better understand and forecast solar activity, such as solar storms, which can disrupt satellite communications and power grids. The IMCP will consist of a matrix of surveillance stations spanning over ten countries and regions, forming the largest network of observatories ever built. The program, which does not include the United States, has garnered cooperation agreements from organizations and research institutes across multiple countries.</p>

          <p>Honda is recalling nearly 260,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal pivot pin. The issue, stemming from improper staking during production, could cause the brake pedal to move side to side, hindering the driver's ability to safely stop the vehicle. The recall affects Acura TLX (2021-2025), Acura MDX (2023-2025), and Honda Pilot (2023-2025) models, with owners being notified to take their vehicles to a dealer for brake pedal replacement if necessary. The faulty pedals were assembled at a U.S. plant before production moved to Mexico, where a camera sensor is now used to ensure proper staking.</p>
