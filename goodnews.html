          <p>The London City Lionesses have broken the world transfer record in women's football by signing French international Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain for £1.4 million. This landmark deal highlights the club's significant investment and ambition since being promoted to the Women's Super League under its wealthy American owner, Michele Kang. The signing is part of a major squad overhaul aimed at disrupting the league's established order and positioning the team as a contender for top honors. Geyoro, a highly decorated midfielder, is expected to make a major impact on the team's performance.</p>

          <p>The world's largest and oldest iceberg, A23a, is rapidly breaking apart and melting as it drifts into the warmer waters of the South Atlantic. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey report that the iceberg, once the size of Oahu, is disintegrating into large chunks. The article notes that its demise is part of a natural, cyclical process for icebergs and does not appear to be directly linked to climate change. After breaking off from Antarctica in 1986 and being grounded for decades, A23a's final journey provides valuable data for scientists studying its environmental impact.</p>

The plan aims to cultivate internationally influential sports companies and host more major global sporting events. This target represents nearly double the industry's value in 2023, signaling a significant state-led push to capitalize on growing public enthusiasm for sports.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the United Kingdom saw a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The boost was largely attributed to favorable sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament, which spurred spending on clothing, footwear, and online goods. Despite the monthly rise, the broader trend for the three months leading to July showed a 0.6% decline. The data release was delayed due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS issued an apology.</p>

          <p>A notable generational divide is emerging in U.S. politics, with dozens of Democrats under 40 running for Congress, many challenging established incumbents. In contrast, young Republicans are largely refraining from primary challenges, signaling satisfaction with their party's current leadership and direction. This trend reflects a broader sentiment among young Democrats who are calling for new leadership to address the party's declining approval ratings among young voters. Meanwhile, young conservatives appear content to follow a more traditional path to power by waiting for senior members to retire.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Friday, buoyed by President Trump's executive order that formalized a reduction in U.S. import tariffs on Japanese automobiles from 27.5% to 15%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a notable jump of over 1%. The positive sentiment was also fueled by Trump's comments about potential tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not producing in the U.S., which caused a rally in several major Asian chip stocks.

          <p>Kenya is in advanced negotiations with the Export-Import Bank of China to restructure its debt, proposing to make repayments in Chinese yuan instead of U.S. dollars. The move is intended to ease pressure on Kenya's foreign currency reserves and significantly lower the interest rate on loans for its Standard Gauge Railway project. According to Kenya's Treasury, switching to yuan-denominated payments could cut the interest rate from over 6% to approximately 3%. This potential agreement reflects a growing trend of bilateral financial arrangements that reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>A growing number of millennial and Gen Z entrepreneurs are using an investment tool known as a 'search fund' to buy and operate existing small businesses rather than starting new ones. This model allows an individual 'searcher' to raise capital from investors to acquire a company, often from a retiring baby boomer owner. The approach is seen as a lower-risk path to entrepreneurship and wealth creation, as it involves established businesses with existing revenue and customers. This trend is helping to address a looming succession crisis for Main Street businesses across the economy.</p>
