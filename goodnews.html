          <h2>Christian Contemporary Music Experiences Unprecedented Mainstream Success on Billboard Charts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:29:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) artists are simultaneously holding spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for extended periods. This trend, described by experts as "faith-flavored music," is gaining mainstream traction, particularly through male artists blending country, conservative politics, and themes of masculinity. The success is partly driven by the massive media ecosystem of megachurches, which provides resources for smaller churches to replicate their high-production worship experiences. This boom reflects a broader cultural moment where a segment of evangelicals feels their values are gaining prominence in popular culture and politics.</p>

          <p>Skydance Media is set to finalize its $8 billion merger with Paramount Global, a move expected to bring significant changes to iconic brands like CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. With Skydance promising $2 billion in cost savings, industry observers anticipate layoffs and major restructuring. Key questions loom over the new leadership's strategy, including whether they will invest enough to make Paramount+ competitive with streaming giants like Netflix. Analysts are also watching how the company will manage its traditional broadcast and cable TV assets, which face declining viewership, and whether creative freedom at shows like 'South Park' will be maintained under the new ownership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:25:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision and will release $5.5 billion in congressionally approved education funds to states. The funds, intended for the 2025-26 school year to support programs like educator training and arts education, were abruptly frozen in July. The White House's Office of Management and Budget had claimed the funds were being misused for a "radical left-wing agenda." However, the move sparked widespread outrage from educators and pushback from Republican lawmakers, including Mitch McConnell, who argued the funds support longstanding, bipartisan programs essential for students and local economies.</p>

          <p>World darts champion Luke Littler has advanced to the semi-finals of the World Matchplay tournament in Blackpool after a tense 16-14 victory over Andrew Gilding. Despite leading comfortably, Littler had to withstand a late comeback from Gilding before securing the win. He will now face Northern Ireland's Josh Rock, who defeated 2023 runner-up Gerwyn Price 16-11 in a high-quality quarter-final match. Rock, who had already eliminated three-time champion Michael van Gerwen, expressed excitement for what he expects to be a "cracking game" against his friend Littler for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>Despite rising US-China tensions, Chinese students are still pursuing higher education in the United States, though they are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now placing greater emphasis on well-known schools, highly-ranked programs, and flexible financial aid packages. Students like Jason Lin, who received a scholarship to Brandeis University, are weighing the benefits of academic freedom against parental concerns about instability and personal fears of potential deportation. This trend indicates that while the appeal of an American education persists, the decision-making process for Chinese students and their families has become more calculated and risk-averse.</p>

          <p>Kelsey Pittman, a 33-year-old woman who had been missing for months and was feared dead, has been found alive in Colorado. The search for Pittman began after her family in North Carolina reported her missing and intensified when her car was discovered abandoned near Slab City in California's harsh Sonoran Desert. The monthslong search involved multiple law enforcement agencies, drones, and search-and-rescue crews who had exhausted efforts to find her in the desolate area. The Inyo County Sheriff's Office announced the positive outcome but provided no further details out of respect for the family's privacy.</p>

          <p>According to the Fire and Rescue Services Association (FRSA), more than 10,000 former retained firefighters in the UK are eligible for but have not claimed pension payments they are owed. Recent legal rulings have entitled on-call firefighters who served between April 2000 and April 2006 to a pension for their entire career. The payments, which can range from a few thousand to over £100,000, have already been claimed by about 16,000 individuals. The union is urging all potentially eligible former firefighters to contact their old employers to inquire about the claims process and secure the benefits they have earned.</p>
