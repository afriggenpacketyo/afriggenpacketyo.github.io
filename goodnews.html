          <p>Sly Stone, the innovative frontman of Sly & the Family Stone, has died at 82 after battling lung disease, leaving behind a legacy of musical innovation that blended psychedelic rock, soul, jazz, gospel, and Latin influences. Born Sylvester Stewart, Stone began his musical journey in gospel with his siblings before becoming a successful R&B DJ and record producer. He formed Sly & the Family Stone in 1966, a group notable for its inclusion of women and both Black and white musicians, producing hits like "Everyday People" and "Dance to the Music." The band's performance at Woodstock in 1969 is remembered as a legendary moment, though the group later dissolved due to Stone's struggles with drug abuse, but his musical contributions continue to inspire. </p>

          <p>Despite a slight decline in the first quarter of 2025, credit card debt remains a significant financial burden for many Americans, with balances totaling $1.18 trillion and high interest rates exacerbating the issue. Experts recommend proactive measures to reduce debt, emphasizing that waiting for Federal Reserve rate cuts is not a viable solution due to their uncertain timing and minimal impact. It is important to understand the implications of various debt relief options, such as debt forgiveness and management programs, and to avoid assuming automatic eligibility, as each option has specific qualifying criteria. By taking a strategic approach, borrowers can begin to reduce their balances and improve their financial health. (not investment advice) </p>

However, the uneven distribution of these minerals and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. Efforts are underway to increase domestic production, develop alternative materials, and improve recycling processes to mitigate these constraints and ensure a sustainable supply of critical minerals. </p>

          <p>The White House has commenced construction projects ordered by President Trump, including paving over grass in the Rose Garden and installing flagpoles on the north and south lawns. The projects are part of a series of personal touches Trump is adding to the Executive Mansion and its grounds. Work has begun in the Rose Garden, with the limestone border removed and the grass dug up in certain areas. Trump stated he was installing the flagpoles, which he is paying for himself, because the White House has needed them for 200 years. </p>

          <p>Employment attorney Diane Seltzer won the election to lead the D.C. Bar Association, defeating securities lawyer Brad Bondi in a race with record voter turnout. Seltzer garnered over 90% of the vote, emphasizing the rule of law as a key focus of her campaign. The race became a microcosm for pressures on the American legal system, partly due to Bondi being the brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Seltzer's victory signals a focus on upholding legal principles and ensuring the safety of attorneys to perform their jobs. </p>
