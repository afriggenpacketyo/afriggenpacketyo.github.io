          <p>A summary of recent artificial intelligence news highlights several key developments across different sectors. For the first time, U.S. fighter pilots have taken directions from an AI in a Pentagon test, signaling a potential shift in aerial warfare tactics. In the corporate world, Elon Musk's xAI has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, alleging anti-competitive practices. Meanwhile, Google showcased its new Pixel 10 lineup, emphasizing AI-enhanced features for consumers, and Meta has launched a political action committee to support pro-AI policies, reflecting the technology's growing influence.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina pastor, Kelvis Reid, is recovering after a harrowing medical journey that began with a sudden cardiac arrest while wrapping Christmas presents. He was diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, a rare condition where abnormal proteins damaged his organs, making his heart as "hard like cement." After his family's CPR training saved his life, he spent weeks unconscious and on life support before stabilizing enough for a dual heart and kidney transplant. Eighteen months later, Reid has returned to his pulpit and even participated in a 5K run alongside the hospital staff who cared for him, sharing his story of survival and faith.</p>

          <h2>Despite Recent Studies, Evidence Shows Cash Transfers Remain an Effective Anti-Poverty Tool</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis pushes back against recent interpretations of studies suggesting guaranteed income programs have lackluster results. While some new, small-scale pilot programs showed limited impact on metrics like mental health or employment, the author argues this overlooks the primary success: cash transfers effectively reduce poverty by giving people money. Decades of research on larger programs like Social Security and tax credits confirm their power to lift millions out of poverty. The limited effects of recent pilots may be due to their small scale and the context of a broader cost-of-living crisis, where a few hundred dollars cannot solve systemic issues like unaffordable housing.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is still grappling with the educational fallout from the mass firing of over 4,000 teachers, most of whom were experienced Black women. In the storm's wake, the city's public school system was transformed into a network of charter schools, and the percentage of Black teachers dropped from 71% to below 50%, a level from which it has not fully recovered. Black-led organizations like Black Education for New Orleans (Be Nola) are now working to reverse this trend through professional development and mentorship programs, aiming to restore Black leadership and role models in the city's schools.</p>

          <p>A personal finance reporter reflects on the unexpected financial lessons learned while shopping for a wedding dress. The key takeaway is that timing is crucial, as ordering a dress too close to the wedding date can incur significant "rush fees," which in her case would have been 20% of her budget. She advises brides to start shopping about a year in advance and purchase the gown eight to ten months out. Additionally, she recommends creating a comprehensive "attire budget" that includes not only the dress but also alterations, a veil, and other accessories, which can add substantial and often overlooked costs.</p>

          <p>In an interview, author Virginia Sole-Smith discusses the growing anxiety surrounding children's diets, particularly concerning ultra-processed foods. She argues against a restrictive, diet-culture approach, emphasizing that food is one of the few areas where children can exercise control, making strong preferences normal. Sole-Smith suggests that instead of focusing on demonizing specific foods, parents and policymakers should address systemic issues like food insecurity and poverty. She advocates for trusting children's bodily autonomy and ensuring they have enough to eat, believing that the nutritional details will sort themselves out without creating unhealthy power struggles over food.</p>

          <p>While many congressional Republicans have avoided constituent-facing events, Representative Mark Alford of Missouri held 15 public forums across his district in a single week. Despite representing a safe Republican district, Alford faced a tense but mostly civil environment, with attendees frequently criticizing President Trump and the administration's policies. A major focus of voter frustration was the new Republican tax and spending package, with many expressing concern over cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. Alford's commitment to public engagement offers a rare glimpse into voter sentiment and the key issues animating constituents in a deeply red district.</p>

          <p>Finland is set to become the first country to implement a permanent solution for high-level nuclear waste by burying it deep underground in a facility named Onkalo. Developed over two decades, the repository is designed to hold all the spent nuclear fuel from the country's five power plants for their entire operational lifecycles. The method involves encapsulating the waste in copper canisters, surrounding them with clay, and placing them in stable bedrock nearly 1,500 feet below the surface. This pioneering project is seen as a major step forward in responsible nuclear energy management and a model for other nations.</p>

          <p>China is deepening its security cooperation in Africa through its Global Security Initiative (GSI), recently providing military training to a new class of Somali army officers. This program aims to help Somalia build a self-reliant defense force to combat the extremist group al-Shabab, particularly as the African Union mission prepares to withdraw. The initiative also included law enforcement and border security training for other Somali officials in China. This engagement reflects Beijing's strategy of offering an alternative security model focused on development and non-interference, aligning with its strategic interests like anti-piracy operations in the region.</p>
