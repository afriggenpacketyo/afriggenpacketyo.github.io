          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he will not seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 2026, a crucial race for control of the Senate. Kemp stated that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family, and he has committed to working alongside Senate GOP leadership and President Trump to ensure a strong Republican nominee can win. Kemp's decision leaves the field open for other potential candidates to challenge Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, who is considered vulnerable. The article notes Kemp's popularity in Georgia and his past victories against Stacey Abrams and a Trump-backed primary challenger.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services experienced brief declines after President Donald Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Experts are questioning how the tariff would be implemented and which parts of the production process would be affected. There are also concerns about potential retaliatory measures from other countries, which could impact international box office sales for Hollywood films.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an anticipated $1.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The automaker expects to offset a portion of the costs through remediation efforts and pricing strategies, but cited near-term risks, including potential supply chain disruptions and increased tariffs. The tariff impact is less than that projected by General Motors. Ford reported a decline in revenue and earnings compared to the previous year, but its electric vehicle business narrowed its losses.</p>
