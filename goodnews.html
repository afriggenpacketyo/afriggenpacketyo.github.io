          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 15:01:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Surgeons at UCLA and USC have successfully performed the first human bladder transplant on a 41-year-old man with reduced bladder capacity due to cancer treatments, offering a potential new treatment for debilitating bladder conditions. The patient, Oscar Larrainzar, expressed renewed hope following the procedure, which aims to avoid complications associated with using bowel tissue for bladder reconstruction. The surgeons, Drs. Gill and Nassiri, plan further clinical trials to assess the long-term outcomes and potential for wider use. While experts acknowledge the technical advancement, some caution against the risks of immunosuppression unless already necessary for other conditions. </p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum reflects on Desi Arnaz's impact on Hollywood, highlighting how his Cuban identity and innovative approach challenged racial barriers in the entertainment industry. In 1950, Arnaz defied expectations by insisting on playing Lucille Ball's husband in "I Love Lucy," a move that promoted diversity in a cautious mass medium. Arnaz's technical innovations, including filming the show and retaining ownership of the negatives, revolutionized television production and syndication. Purdum argues that Arnaz's legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in today's cultural landscape. </p>
