          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage trial. The pill, a GLP-1 therapy similar to the company's injectable drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, led to an average weight loss of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks. Common side effects included nausea and diarrhea, causing about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue the trial. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more accessible and affordable pill-based option available by 2026.</p>

The suspect, a sergeant at the base, used his personal weapon and is now in custody. Six soldiers were awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for their bravery, with officials stating their quick actions and first-aid training saved lives by stopping severe bleeding before medical help arrived.

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled a lawsuit regarding her 2021 firing from the Lucasfilm series "The Mandalorian." Carano had sued for wrongful termination and discrimination, alleging she was fired for expressing her political opinions on social media, which included controversial posts comparing the U.S. political climate to Nazi Germany. While details of the settlement were not disclosed, both parties expressed a desire for healing and moving forward. A Lucasfilm spokesperson noted Carano's professionalism and stated the company looks forward to potential future collaborations, a significant shift from its original statement condemning her posts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British holidaymakers are increasingly booking shorter, last-minute trips closer to home, according to major travel companies like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Butlin's. This trend is attributed to a combination of budget-consciousness and a desire to take advantage of favorable weather forecasts. Firms report a significant rise in searches for domestic trips within the next six weeks and a decrease in the time between booking and traveling. The shift suggests that many people are opting for more spontaneous and affordable getaways, such as camping or all-inclusive resort stays within the UK, as a way to manage costs while still enjoying a break.</p>

          <p>A pop-up health clinic operating on the quayside in Brixham, England, is being highlighted as a successful model for preventative, community-focused healthcare. The Seafit clinic brings GPs, nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists directly to fishermen, a group that often struggles to access traditional NHS services due to their demanding work schedules. By offering on-site health screenings, the clinic has diagnosed conditions like sepsis and prostate cancer early, preventing more serious illness. This approach aligns with the NHS's new 10-year plan to shift focus from hospital-based treatment to localized, preventative care, especially in underserved rural and coastal communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research from financial services group CLSA, President Trump's proposed 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors are expected to have a minimal direct impact on China's leading chip manufacturers, SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor. The analysis suggests these firms could even benefit from potential countermeasures from China and other nations. This assessment is based partly on customs data showing that China has successfully diversified its integrated circuit exports towards Southeast Asian countries. In the first half of 2025, China's chip exports to the U.S. had already declined by 11% year-over-year, indicating a reduced dependency on the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cybersecurity stock sector experienced a significant downturn, largely triggered by a 25% plunge in Fortinet's shares after the company indicated its firewall refresh cycle was further along than anticipated. This news dragged down peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, despite their different business models. Some investment analysts argue this sell-off is an overreaction, particularly for cloud-native companies not reliant on hardware cycles. They see the current dip as a potential buying opportunity, believing the market has unfairly punished the entire group for an issue specific to one company's product cycle.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily stopped construction at a new immigration detention facility in Florida's Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz' by critics. The order was issued in response to a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility's construction violates federal law by proceeding without an environmental impact statement. Judge Kathleen Williams issued the 14-day restraining order after learning construction was still ongoing despite the legal challenge. Environmental experts testified that the facility would harm water quality and threaten the habitat of the endangered Florida panther, while immigration detention operations at the site will continue.</p>

In the horror genre, "Weapons," from "Barbarian" director Zach Cregger, offers an original and ambitious story about the mysterious disappearance of schoolchildren, praised for its sharp script and strong performances, particularly from Julia Garner.

          <p>The launch of OpenAI's GPT-5 represents a strategic shift in the artificial intelligence race, prioritizing a seamless and integrated user experience over pure benchmark performance. While the new model boasts state-of-the-art capabilities, its core innovation lies in simplifying the user's choice by automatically modulating its approach based on the query. This, combined with new personalization features and integrations with services like Gmail, aims to make ChatGPT an indispensable personal and corporate assistant. The strategy appears to be building an ecosystem that is difficult for users to leave, resetting the terms of competition for rivals like Google and Anthropic.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial landing and take-off test for its crewed lunar lander, a significant step toward its goal of putting astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test involved a prototype of the four-legged Lanyue lander, which is designed to transport two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back. Conducted at a specialized facility that simulates lunar gravity and terrain, the trial verified the integration of the lander's complex systems, including its guidance, navigation, and propulsion.
