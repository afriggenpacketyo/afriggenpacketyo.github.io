          <p>New satellite photos reveal the aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iran's Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities. The images show damage to the mountainside at Fordo, with craters and blocked tunnel entrances. At Isfahan, there is extensive building damage, while Natanz shows a hole directly over part of the underground complex. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has seen no increase in off-site radiation levels, but is unable to assess underground damage at Fordo, urging a return to dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This call follows Iran's warning that it reserves all options to defend its sovereignty after U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Blocking the strait could have significant consequences for the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. Rubio suggests it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt its own oil exports to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The conflict between the US and Iran has put renewed focus on the Strait of Hormuz, a key waterway for global oil transit. The strait connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of crude oil daily. The US Energy Information Administration describes it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint." Experts believe that Iran is unlikely to close it and exporters have other options.</p>

While the US claims the bombing was an "incredible and overwhelming success," the assessment is measured, and Iran may not have lost its ability to make a nuclear bomb. The US wants Iran to negotiate peace, but Iran is talking of a closed diplomatic door and sending its foreign minister to Moscow.</p>
