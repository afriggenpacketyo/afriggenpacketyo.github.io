          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. is not at war with Iran, but rather with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated" due to the strikes on facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves the right to defend itself, raising concerns about potential escalation. Vance stated that the U.S. desires peace but insists on Iran not possessing a nuclear weapons program, which he believes the recent actions have achieved. </p>

He highlighted that the strikes were aimed at degrading Iran's nuclear capabilities, not at regime change or harming the Iranian people. Rubio underscored the U.S.'s commitment to defending its interests and allies in the Middle East, particularly in response to potential Iranian aggression. </p>

          <p>A rare June heatwave is affecting tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, with numerous heat advisories in effect. Temperatures are soaring, with heat indices expected to reach or exceed 100¬∞F in many areas, prompting health departments to declare heat emergencies. The extreme heat has led to event cancellations, adjustments to outdoor activities, and warnings for athletes and outdoor workers. Meteorologists attribute the heatwave to a "heat dome," a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, with the unusual aspect being its widespread impact across the eastern part of the country. </p>

Jasprit Bumrah bowled Woakes and Bashir, taking 5-83, and England had the momentum until rain stopped play, leaving the match finely balanced. </p>

Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight dip, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains, and Egypt's EGX30 performed strongly. Analysts suggest that the Gulf region's call for peaceful resolutions and distancing from Israeli aggression has helped insulate it from significant market impacts. The removal of the Iranian threat is expected to positively impact the market in the mid-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government faces diplomatic challenges after the US airstrikes on Iran, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer navigates a delicate situation. While the UK supports the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons development, it has not explicitly endorsed the US's methods. Starmer had previously expressed confidence that Trump would not intervene, but the recent events have shifted the landscape. The UK was given advance warning of the US action but was not asked to participate, potentially due to legal concerns. </p>

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that threats, bribes, and harsh consequences can hinder cooperation. Instead, using language that respects a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries fosters a desire to cooperate. Phrases like "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" trigger a child's defense mechanisms. The alternative phrases focus on explaining decisions, giving agency, acknowledging emotions, and inviting problem-solving, which promote trust, emotional safety, and cooperation. </p>
