          <h2>New Bill Aims to Facilitate Cannabis Research Amidst Increasing Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 07:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly proposed bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill to allow research to align with the growing cannabis consumption in the United States. The EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that hinder federal funding for Schedule I substance research. Experts have mixed opinions on the bill's likelihood of passage, but some believe it could garner bipartisan support by prioritizing evidence over ideology.</p>
