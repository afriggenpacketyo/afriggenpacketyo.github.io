          <p>EPA chief Lee Zeldin announced a major overhaul of the agency aimed at reducing staffing to Reagan-era levels and saving taxpayers an estimated $300 million annually. The reorganization will focus on incorporating science into rule-making and prioritizing clean air, land, and water initiatives. The EPA plans to restructure several offices, including the Office of the Administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, and Office of Water. Zeldin emphasized the need to reduce excess spending and improve efficiency within the agency, which had seen a significant increase in budget and grant awards under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging element in relationship arguments. This phrase, while seemingly minor, communicates that the partner is inadequate and that someone else would be a better fit. The underlying issue is often a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. The article suggests a better approach involves clearly communicating needs without shame or comparison, fostering a more secure and emotionally close relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article explores the idea of repurposing underused single-family homes into multifamily units as a solution to the affordable housing crisis. Developers like Monte Anderson are retrofitting existing homes into "roommate houses" with multiple studio apartments, circumventing zoning restrictions. Cities and states are encouraging similar initiatives by easing regulations on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) like backyard cottages. This approach aims to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption, addressing the mismatch between large houses and smaller households.</p>
