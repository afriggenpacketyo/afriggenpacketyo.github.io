          <p>Some parents are adding their young children, even toddlers, as authorized users on their credit cards to help them establish a credit history early in life. Banks like Capital One, Bank of America, and Chase allow children with Social Security numbers to become authorized users. This practice aims to teach children about the value of money and responsible spending habits from a young age. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of a good credit score for future financial opportunities, such as securing better rates on mortgages and car loans, and some employers are even considering credit scores during the hiring process.</p>

          <p>Amid widespread unrest in Los Angeles following immigration raids, DW Fact Check has investigated several viral videos and claims circulating on social media and found them to be misleading or unfounded. One claim falsely linked an old video of a car explosion to the current protests, while another alleged that photos of National Guard personnel sleeping on the ground were taken in Afghanistan in 2021. The fact check confirms that the photos were recently taken in Los Angeles, debunking the claim. This effort aims to combat the spread of misinformation during a time of heightened tension and social unrest.</p>

The plan prioritizes funding for health and directs resources towards the Midlands and the North of England, rather than London. These strategic reallocations are designed to address years of under-investment, with the benefits expected to materialize in the long term. Reeves's approach stems from technical changes made to borrowing rules in the previous budget, enabling increased capital spending and a focus on sustainable economic growth.</p>
