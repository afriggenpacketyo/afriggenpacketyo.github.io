          <p>President Trump's strategy of imposing tariffs on China has largely failed to achieve its intended goals, leading to a temporary truce and rollback of tariffs. The article suggests that while Trump aimed to reshape the global trading order and reduce dependence on China, the tariffs caused economic damage and market chaos. The current agreement involves reducing tariffs to pre-Liberation Day levels, plus a new 10 percent levy. This shift indicates that Trump is now seeking a deal he can claim as a win, rather than pursuing a grand rebalancing of the global trading order.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a temporary trade truce, drastically reducing tariffs on each other for 90 days while they negotiate a more permanent deal. While Wall Street has reacted positively, experts warn that supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers in the coming weeks. The article notes that the temporary truce brings tariff rates back to pre-trade war levels, but supply chains have already been disrupted. Scott Bessent, Trump‚Äôs Treasury secretary, has secured a commitment from China to cut non-tariff barriers, but acknowledges that the upcoming talks will be difficult.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, but experts are skeptical about its effectiveness. The order directs federal agencies to cut prices, but lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. Health policy experts question how much the policy can reduce prices for patients, affect drugmakers' profits, and whether Trump can even implement the plan. The article notes that pharmaceutical stocks rose on the news, suggesting investors are not overly concerned about the plan's impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The article delves into the political and cultural implications of being in the closet, as well as the renewed focus on trans rights and acceptance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose, and then walk back, triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products demonstrated the power and global reach of U.S. trade policy. However, it also illustrated the limitations of Trump's aggressive approach. While the tariffs brought much trade between the countries to a standstill, they ultimately proved too painful for American businesses to sustain. The article suggests that the recent trade talks and tariff chaos did not generate any immediate concessions from China other than a commitment to keep talking.</p>
