          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, marking a 10% increase from the previous year. This growth demonstrates the sector's resilience and continued momentum, even as the Trump administration has taken steps to roll back low-carbon initiatives in the United States. The report highlights a significant flow of capital towards modernizing energy grids and transmission infrastructure, which is crucial for accommodating more renewable sources. Despite this positive trend, the analysis also notes that the pace of investment must accelerate to meet international climate goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The record-breaking structure was constructed with the help of artificial intelligence, which managed unmanned equipment in a process likened to 3D printing. This innovative method, incorporating digital twin and blockchain technologies, allowed engineers to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. The project represents a major advancement in automated construction and infrastructure development, showcasing China's growing capabilities in applying AI to large-scale engineering feats.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, following a strong rally in the United States that saw all three major indexes close at new record highs. The positive momentum was largely driven by chipmaker Nvidia's announcement of a plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI for building advanced data centers. This news propelled tech stocks and created a bullish sentiment that has extended to global markets. Investors in Europe are also closely monitoring developments in Sino-U.S. relations and awaiting key manufacturing and trade data from Germany, the U.K., and Spain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese property developer Seazen Group is seeking to raise funds in the offshore dollar bond market, reflecting a broader trend of mainland firms returning to this financing channel. This move signals a potential thawing of investor sentiment after China's property crisis had effectively closed off such funding routes. Companies from China, Hong Kong, and Macau have collectively issued about $80 billion in dollar notes this year, a 21% increase from the previous year. Seazen's offering, aimed at refinancing existing debt, is seen as a test of whether global investors are regaining confidence in a sector previously deemed untouchable. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking in Beijing, Perdue stated that while a meeting could happen in the near future, 2026 is the more probable timeframe. The comments followed a recent phone call between the two leaders, after which Trump had suggested a meeting could take place next month. Perdue, who was accompanying a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, described the current relationship between the two presidents as "very good and very encouraging."</p>

          <p>Week three of the NFL season was marked by a series of dramatic finishes, with five games decided on the final play. The Philadelphia Eagles remained undefeated after blocking a last-second field goal attempt by the Los Angeles Rams and returning it for a game-winning touchdown.

          <p>In an opinion piece, pediatrician Mike Freelander addresses recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy to autism, calling the claims very worrying. He emphasizes that there is no scientific evidence of causation and that major studies have disproved such a link, while noting that medicine regulators worldwide, including Australia's TGA, consider the medication safe for pregnant women. Freelander warns that such unscientific statements from political figures can cause significant distress and lead to poor health outcomes if expectant mothers avoid necessary medication. He urges the public to trust established regulatory bodies and scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The ruling for a preliminary injunction stated that the government likely violated federal law by not providing specific procedures or explanations for the funding cuts. The administration had suspended over $584 million in grants to UCLA, citing allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The restored funds primarily support hundreds of medical research grants at the university, including studies on Parkinson's disease, cancer recovery, and nerve regeneration.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Modern Football Is Adopting Tactics Popularized by Sam Allardyce</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend in elite football appears to be reviving the direct, set-piece-focused tactics famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce over two decades ago. This article explores how modern coaches are increasingly favoring long passes from the goalkeeper and emphasizing goals from dead-ball situations, a departure from the possession-based style that has dominated recent years. Allardyce, once criticized for his methods, notes that many teams are now recognizing the statistical advantages of his pragmatic approach. The shift is evident in the rise of specialized set-piece coaches and the transfer strategies of top clubs, which are once again prioritizing tall, physical strikers.</p>

          <p>Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, has identified resilience as the most crucial leadership quality for navigating the industry's current challenges, including new U.S. tariffs and economic instability. The tariffs, imposed by President Donald Trump, affect key manufacturing hubs for the fashion industry, creating significant commercial hurdles for designers. Weir stated that the council is actively working with American counterparts to explain the negative impact of these duties on British brands. Her emphasis on resilience aligns with a recent survey of business leaders who ranked it as the top quality needed to manage today's volatile economic environment.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison in Egypt after being pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Abdel Fattah, one of the country's most well-known political prisoners, had been imprisoned for nearly six years on charges of "spreading false news." His release follows a high-profile international campaign and an extensive hunger strike by his mother, Laila Soueif, which brought her close to death. A key figure in the 2011 uprising, his detention was widely condemned by human rights groups as part of a broader crackdown on dissent under President Sisi's government.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring at the UN that "the time for peace has come." The move is part of a growing wave of recognition from Western nations, including the UK, Canada, and Australia, aimed at advancing a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This diplomatic shift increases international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and its settlement policies. The United States did not attend a French-hosted summit on the issue, highlighting a divide among G7 nations on the timing and approach to Palestinian statehood.</p>
