          <p>Pro wrestling legend Ric Flair revealed he is battling skin cancer for the second time in three years, reversing his previous denial of such reports. The 76-year-old Hall of Famer shared his diagnosis in an interview, stating he will undergo treatment soon, citing concerns for his privacy as the reason for his initial denial. Flair had previously addressed the rumors on social media, asserting he was cancer-free, and had also announced his split from his fifth wife, Wendy Barlow, in September, thanking her for her support during a health crisis in 2017. Despite the challenges, Flair's announcement reflects a proactive approach to his health.</p>

          <p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter captured an unprecedented image of a 12-mile-high Martian volcano, Arsia Mons, poking through clouds at dawn. This is the first time one of the volcanoes in the Tharsis Mountains has been imaged on the planet's horizon. The image focuses on Arsia Mons, which is twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa. The angle of the camera allows scientists to observe dust and water ice cloud layers, providing new clues about how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time. The successful capture of this image underscores the continued success of the Odyssey mission.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist, Dr. Andrew Freeman, recommends oatmeal as a top breakfast choice for maintaining a healthy heart. He suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to reduce calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for extra fiber and health benefits. Dr. Freeman advises avoiding instant oatmeal due to its processed nature and added sugars. Oatmeal contains beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels. The recommendation is part of a broader strategy for promoting heart health through diet.</p>

To meet Trump's desire to utilize the new plane before his term ends, some security precautions may need to be omitted. The president's desire for a quick upgrade must be balanced with critical security considerations. There are many logistical concerns.</p>
