        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission is proposing to weaken environmental conditions attached to subsidies for farmers, a move intended to address concerns raised during months of protests across the European Union. The proposed changes aim to reduce the administrative burden on farmers and boost their competitiveness, potentially saving them up to ‚Ç¨1.58 billion per year. Smaller farms would be exempt from environmental regulations tied to subsidies, and certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain environmental standards. EU Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen stated that the goal is to cut bureaucracy so farmers can focus on food production while protecting natural resources.</p>

          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths experienced a significant drop in 2024, with 30,000 fewer deaths compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded. Provisional data from the CDC estimates that 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. However, concerns remain that reductions in federal funding and public health workforce could slow or halt this progress.</p>

The court found that the commission did not provide sufficient explanation for refusing the request, raising questions about transparency in negotiations that involve taxpayer money and shape public policy.
