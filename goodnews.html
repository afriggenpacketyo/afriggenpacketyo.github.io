          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for arguments in relationships, with tone of voice or attitude being the primary trigger. Contempt, signaled through a sour tone, is a strong predictor of divorce, unlike direct criticism. Other frequent causes include family relations, often reflecting unmet needs and misalignments, and household chores, stemming from an uneven distribution of labor. Communication styles, particularly ineffective or hostile interactions, and financial issues, including differing spending habits and financial stressors, also contribute significantly to relationship conflict.</p>
