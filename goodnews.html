          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the 80th anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing. This decision follows last year's event, from which Israel was not invited due to the conflict in Gaza, prompting a boycott from other G7 ambassadors. The city of Nagasaki has adopted a more inclusive approach for this year's ceremony, extending invitations to all diplomatic missions in Japan. Russia's ambassador is also expected to attend for the first time since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, signaling a shift in diplomatic participation.</p>

          <p>British authorities have successfully intercepted one of the country's largest drug shipments in years, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The drugs, with an estimated street value of $132 million, were discovered hidden under containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The seizure was the result of an intelligence-led operation involving the UK Border Force. This bust highlights the ongoing efforts to combat large-scale drug trafficking into Britain, which is considered one of Europe's largest markets for cocaine, amid rising cocaine-related deaths in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump is concluding a highly successful week marked by significant achievements both domestically and internationally. Key victories include brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after a successful U.S. strike, securing a commitment from NATO allies to increase defense spending, and a major Supreme Court ruling that curtails the power of lower courts to block his executive orders nationwide. The week was capped by a peace deal signed between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which also secured U.S. access to critical mineral rights. These events have bolstered the president's image as a decisive leader and peacemaker.</p>

          <p>Americans may see significant relief at the pump this summer, with one petroleum analyst forecasting the cheapest fuel prices since 2021. The national average price for a gallon of gasoline is projected to continue a slow decline, potentially dropping below $3 by September. While a recent spike was attributed to the conflict in the Middle East, the situation's de-escalation is expected to allow prices to fall again. Factors contributing to the decrease include stabilized production costs and increased oil supply from OPEC+ nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers and participants in the Budapest Pride march proceeded with the event on Saturday, in defiance of legal threats from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The demonstration challenges a controversial new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with potential fines and prison sentences for attendees and organizers. Despite the government's stance, the march received support from EU officials and the liberal mayor of Budapest, who co-organized the event to grant it municipal protection. Participants marched to advocate for diversity and protest what they describe as an infringement on their fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>Despite earning nearly $49 million during his NFL career, legendary quarterback Steve Young continues to drive a 2011 Toyota Sienna with 132,000 miles on it. He attributes this frugal habit to his father's advice to "get the most out of it," a principle he has taken to heart. The article notes that this behavior is not uncommon among the wealthy, with many millionaires preferring modest, reliable cars over flashy luxury vehicles. This contrasts with the growing trend of average consumers taking on significant auto loan debt, highlighting a potential lesson in financial prudence and avoiding lifestyle inflation.</p>

The company acknowledged it is actively exploring global market options but reiterated its commitment to its UK operations and British heritage.
