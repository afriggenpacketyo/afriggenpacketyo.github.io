          <p>Senior Pentagon officials provided details about the U.S. operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. Gen. Dan Caine stated the mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" on targets at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The operation included a complex maneuver with in-flight refuelings, fighter jet escorts, and the deployment of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or people. The U.S. has warned Iran against retaliatory action, stating that forces remain on high alert and are prepared to respond to any attacks.</p>

          <p>Kyoto saw a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, totaling 56.06 million visitors overall, according to a recent tourism survey. Despite overtourism issues, satisfaction among both foreign and Japanese visitors remains high, with over 90% reporting satisfaction. Foreign tourists prioritize temples, shrines, and historic sites, while Japanese visitors are more affected by the crowds. Kyoto is implementing a lodging tax increase in 2026 to address overtourism, with revenue directed towards strengthening related measures. The survey gathered responses from over 5,500 visitors, indicating a generally positive experience despite the challenges of increased tourism.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces its first giant panda absence in over half a century, amidst increasing Sino-U.S. rivalry. China's decisions on leasing pandas are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks, and experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese leader to Japan. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between China and Japan, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions. With tensions between China and the U.S., a new panda loan could serve to stabilize relations with Tokyo, though its diplomatic weight may not be as significant as in the past.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Cooperation in Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests using specific phrases to encourage cooperation in children. Traditional parenting phrases that involve threats or harsh consequences often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the expert recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries, fostering a sense of safety and involvement. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and focusing on problem-solving instead of blame; these shifts aim to create conditions where cooperation feels natural and reduce power struggles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro jabs, aimed at assisting with weight loss, are now available at GP surgeries in England, but only for individuals meeting stringent criteria. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. The medication, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, makes individuals feel fuller, thus reducing food intake; it is to be offered to people with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and specific health conditions. Some GP practices are warning ineligible patients against booking appointments to discuss the jabs, while pharmacy trade organizations express concern that demand will exceed supply.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, won the most seats, indicating the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies. The LDP's poor performance further strains Ishiba's minority government in national politics. The election commission reported increased voter turnout compared to the previous election, suggesting heightened public engagement.</p>

          <p>China has become a global leader in electric vehicles (EVs) through long-term planning and government funding. Almost half of all cars sold in China last year were electric, driven by government subsidies and consumer incentives. The Chinese government spent an estimated $231 billion developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EVs. China also dominates critical supply chains in battery production and has built the world's largest public charging network; the country's success reflects a concerted effort to dominate future technologies.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is planning to establish a clinic offering ketamine as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy. Ketamine, though not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The psychiatrist hopes to offer the treatment to patients with hard-to-treat depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); this potential expansion reflects growing interest in innovative treatments for mental health conditions.</p>
