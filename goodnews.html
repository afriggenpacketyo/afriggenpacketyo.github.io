          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was relocated to the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire damaged their high school. The event was bittersweet for students, as the Bowl wasn't their beloved Stadium by the Sea, but they were honored to graduate at such a storied venue. The January fire destroyed homes of many students and faculty, forcing them to adjust to online learning and later in-person classes at a former Sears building. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal addressed the graduates, emphasizing resilience and important life lessons. The article reflects on the challenges and triumphs of the graduating class. </p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The research, focusing on feathers dating back 99 million years, explores how birds surpassed their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The team, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, highlighted the importance of feathers in generating thrust and lift for flight. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the ability to fly. The optimism score is not explicitly mentioned in the article.</p>

          <h2>Early Bacterial Exposure May Reduce Hospitalization Risk for Lung Infections</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to certain bacteria in newborns may protect against dangerous infections. The study found that babies colonized with Bifidobacterium longum in the first week of life were less likely to be hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery, highlighting the importance of early microbial exposure. The study suggests potential therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>The 2025 NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers marks a generational shift with teams led by predominantly Gen Z players. Both teams, among the youngest in NBA history, represent a new blueprint for the league, built through strategic draft picks and trades rather than signing veteran players. The Thunder, led by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, finished the regular season with a dominant record, while the Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton, secured a No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference. This Finals represents a passing of the torch in a league traditionally dominated by veterans. The teams are also connecting with younger fans through social media. </p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding, due to unknown risks to the unborn child. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are concerned about the unsafe use of GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro. These medicines are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but many are buying them online without medical advice. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking these medicines and for a period afterward. The optimism score is not explicitly stated in the article.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, who said he was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there, was flown back to the US after a judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. The man, identified as OCG, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing multiple attacks in Guatemala due to his sexual orientation. Following the judge's order, the Trump administration admitted to an ‚Äúerror‚Äù of falsely claiming that OCG was not afraid of being returned to Mexico. Meanwhile, another federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a prison in El Salvador a chance to challenge their deportations.
