          <p>Sungrow Power Supply, the world's largest manufacturer of solar inverters and energy storage systems, has filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The move comes as the Hefei-based company aims to capitalize on the city's booming stock market, despite facing new U.S. import tariffs on Chinese-made solar products. With a 25.2% global market share in inverters and a leading position in energy storage, Sungrow's listing seeks to further solidify its dominance in the renewable energy sector. The company has maintained its top position in global inverter shipments for ten consecutive years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled a major international criminal gang believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China annually. The investigation, triggered by a single victim tracking their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, uncovered a network that may handle nearly half of all phones stolen in London. The operation has revealed that street thieves were paid up to £300 per handset, which could then be sold for as much as £4,000 in China. This crackdown represents the UK's largest-ever operation against phone theft amid rising incidents nationwide.</p>

The recent gains also follow the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

The facility houses servers in large, 1,300-tonne cabins submerged 35 meters deep, using seawater for natural cooling. This innovative approach is expected to lower operational costs compared to traditional land-based data centers that require extensive energy for cooling systems. The project is a key component of Hainan's strategy to develop new technologies for its "blue economy," with plans to eventually deploy 100 data cabins.</p>

          <p>A unique art exhibition is bringing together artifacts from a Tang dynasty shipwreck and a replica of an ancient Chinese sailboat with the works of Western artists like Monet. The curator was inspired by a Monet painting of merchant ships, drawing a parallel between the global journey of goods and the borderless nature of art. The exhibition aims to show how maritime culture, much like a great ship, connects different ports and countries by exchanging goods and ideas. This creative convergence highlights the enduring cycle of cultural exchange and the universal power of art to inspire across different civilizations and eras.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a 4% prediction in April, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. The upgrade comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., as China's economy has been supported by government stimulus and strong export performance, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the report cautions that this momentum may slow, projecting growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus measures are toned down. The bank also noted persistent domestic challenges, including a real estate slump, sluggish consumer spending, and high youth unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese automotive giant BYD has announced that the UK is now its largest market outside of China, following a massive 880% year-over-year sales increase in September. The company sold over 11,000 cars, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model, capturing 3.6% of the UK market. This growth is notable as the UK has not imposed the same high tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles as the EU and the US, making it an attractive market. The sales boom coincides with a record month for EV sales in the UK overall, according to industry data.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens are once again present in Exmoor National Park following a successful reintroduction effort by conservationists. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project released 19 of the mammals, sourced from Scottish populations, at undisclosed locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and adaptation to the new environment. Conservationists hailed the return as a "positive sign for nature," emphasizing that re-establishing this native species, which is a critical part of the woodland ecosystem, demonstrates that nature can be restored.</p>

          <p>The Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's, which closed its U.S. locations two decades ago, has made its return with a new restaurant in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The reopening was met with significant enthusiasm, as reservations for its first day were fully booked and devoted fans traveled from as far as Ohio to be among the first customers. The original Minnesota-born chain, founded in 1975, grew to over 200 locations before bankruptcy and a hepatitis A outbreak led to its demise in 2004. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which owns the Chi-Chi's trademark.</p>
