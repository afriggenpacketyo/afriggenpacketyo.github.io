          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by gambling scandals.

The article details the circumstances of Rose's ban for betting on baseball and Jackson's involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider the candidacies of these players, though some argue that their past actions should disqualify them based on character and integrity.</p>

          <p>Netflix has acquired "Selena y Los Dinos," a documentary film about the life of Tejano music icon Selena Quintanilla, scheduled to begin streaming in winter 2025. The film features original VHS footage taken by Selena‚Äôs older sister, Suzette, and is interspersed with present-day interviews with family and friends. The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death. It also captures, in real time, the evolution of a bold new identity growing among Latino youth in the 1980s, encapsulated in Los Dinos‚Äô cultural hybridity.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to four Iranian officials familiar with the plan. Iran‚Äôs foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, proposed the idea to an American special envoy, Steve Witkoff, when the two men held direct and indirect talks in Oman on Sunday, according to the four Iranian officials. The plan entails the establishment of a three-country nuclear consortium in which Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade, beneath that needed for nuclear weapons, and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use.</p>

Cynthia Marshall, who was CEO for the Mavericks from 2018 until December of last year, is on Chime's board, so the company included details of the arrangement in the related party transactions section of its filing.</p>

          <p>An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been used to sort through comments about botox and lip fillers, that were submitted as part of a public consultation, in what officials said was the first use of this kind in the UK. Officials set the tool to work sifting responses to a Scottish government consultation on regulating non-surgical cosmetic procedures. They found it came up with "nearly identical" results, when compared to humans set the same task.</p>
