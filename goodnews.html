          <p>Former President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy and hormone treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, according to his spokesperson. Diagnosed in May 2025 with a Gleason score of 9, indicating metastasis to the bone, Biden's condition is classified as high-grade but appears hormone-sensitive. Treatment began several weeks ago in Philadelphia, with reports indicating he is responding well. The former president, who also underwent skin cancer treatment previously, has been a prominent advocate for cancer research, having lost his eldest son to brain cancer in 2015.</p>

          <p>As a U.S.-brokered peace deal progresses, Israel is anticipating the release of hostages held by Hamas, while Palestinians are returning to devastated homes in northern Gaza. A 72-hour deadline for Hamas to release 48 remaining hostages, 20 believed alive, is set for Monday. This development follows the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza, allowing approximately 500,000 Palestinians to return. An upcoming summit in Egypt, attended by multiple world leaders, aims to finalize the agreement and secure a lasting peace, with the first phase of the deal expected to commence with prisoner exchanges and increased aid.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies has sparked questions about his form heading into the NL Championship Series. The superstar struggled, going one for 18 with nine strikeouts, attributing some of his difficulties to facing multiple left-handed pitchers. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the tough matchups but emphasized the need for Ohtani to improve his at-bat quality and manage the strike zone more effectively. The team recognizes that a similar performance will not lead to a World Series victory, highlighting the pressure on Ohtani to recalibrate his approach.</p>

Allen, 33, made a comeback to boxing after a five-year retirement, with this being his first time headlining at the venue. He expressed immense gratitude for the atmosphere and vowed not to quit the sport, having previously rebuilt his career after significant setbacks. Makhmudov, an imposing fighter with a strong knockout record, proved to be Allen's toughest opponent yet.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday of October, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST). This annual change, occurring at 02:00 BST on Sunday, October 26, will grant most people an extra hour of sleep. The shift will bring sunset forward by an hour, leading to noticeably darker evenings. Daylight Saving Time, first adopted by Germany in 1916, was introduced in the UK to maximize evening daylight during wartime. Debates persist about permanently adopting BST, with arguments for economic boosts and reduced road accidents, but concerns over dark winter mornings, especially in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Lakers coach JJ Redick stated that Luka Doncic's participation in Sunday's preseason game against the Golden State Warriors is still "TBD," despite his full involvement in Saturday's practice. Doncic anticipates playing in two preseason games before the regular season begins on October 21. With LeBron James sidelined for three to four weeks due to a sciatica nerve issue, Doncic acknowledges the significant change but emphasizes a "next man up" mentality for the team. He expects to carry a heavy load, but is focused on doing whatever it takes to secure wins, maintaining that team chemistry extends beyond on-court interactions.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen recounts her initial shock and subsequent understanding after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Patsy, a bowel cancer survivor, views body donation as a way to express gratitude to medical professionals and aid future doctors. Owen documented her journey to understand her mother's wishes, visiting Cardiff University's anatomy center where donated bodies are used for education. The article highlights the profound impact donors have on medical students, who form a connection with their "silent teachers." While body donation provides an invaluable resource, it can mean a long wait for families to hold a funeral, prompting memorial services in the interim.</p>

          <p>Former investment banker and LAUSD superintendent Austin Beutner appears to be laying the groundwork for a mayoral campaign against incumbent Karen Bass in 2026. Social media accounts briefly displayed "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" banners, which were quickly removed. Beutner, 65, would be a significant challenger, bringing extensive experience in finance, journalism, and local government. His potential run comes as Mayor Bass faces criticism over her handling of recent city crises, including a devastating fire, a budget shortfall, and federal immigration crackdowns. Beutner's past political ventures and philanthropic work position him as a formidable candidate, despite his previous withdrawal from a mayoral race in 2012.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the document is expected to reshape the country's approach to infrastructure spending and investment. Historically, these plans have driven massive public works, like the 2009 stimulus package, which significantly boosted economic growth but also led to local government debt. The upcoming plan is anticipated to shift towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects, moving beyond traditional large-scale connectivity. Despite concerns over existing debt burdens, economists remain optimistic about the continued scale of infrastructure investment, emphasizing innovation and strategic development to meet future demands. This article discusses how China aims to maintain economic momentum through evolving infrastructure strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Illinois, partially upholding a lower court's decision. The Chicago-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit allowed the troops to remain under federal control but blocked their deployment for patrol duties, citing a lack of evidence for a "danger of rebellion." Illinois and Chicago officials had sued, arguing the deployment was a "grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty" amidst Trump's efforts to address illegal immigration and crime. This ruling follows similar legal challenges against National Guard deployments in other Democratic-led cities like Portland and Los Angeles.</p>
