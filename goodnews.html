          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields hover near record highs. Rising Japanese government bond yields could entice Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. Analysts are divided on the severity of the impact, with some predicting a gradual decline in the carry trade unwind due to eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar, while others foresee a less severe impact due to structural factors and strong U.S.-Japan ties.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship launch reached orbit but experienced a propellant leak, leading to a loss of attitude control and an uncontrolled reentry, likely disintegrating over the Indian Ocean. Despite this "rapid unscheduled disassembly," the launch demonstrated the vehicle's ability to reach orbit, marking an improvement over previous tests. SpaceX aims for Starship to be fully reusable and capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance. The company will review the data from this test to improve Starship's reliability as it seeks to make life multiplanetary.</p>

This increase is a "conservation success story" amid rapid global population decline. The island's isolation protects the puffins from predators and human impact. Conservationists believe the thriving population is due to an abundance of food and lack of predators, though the species is still listed as vulnerable to extinction.</p>

The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will be allotted maximum emission allowances, and those exceeding the threshold will need to purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus. While the system aims to lower emissions, companies may pass on the costs to consumers through price hikes.</p>
