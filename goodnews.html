        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new data from the banking trade body UK Finance, half of all adults in the United Kingdom now regularly use mobile payment services like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This marks a significant shift in consumer behavior, with usage growing across all age demographics, from 78% of 16 to 24-year-olds to nearly 20% of those over 65. While debit cards remain the most popular payment method, the rise of digital wallets has slightly reduced the use of physical contactless cards and further diminished the role of cash, prompting warnings from campaigners about protecting access to physical currency for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Chunk, a brown bear weighing over 500kg, has won the 2025 Fat Bear Week competition, an annual event where the public votes for the bear that best prepares for winter hibernation. Hosted by Alaska's Katmai National Park, the contest celebrates the resilience and success of the region's bear population. Chunk's victory was particularly notable as he had overcome a broken jaw earlier in the year, with park rangers praising his ability to adapt and continue fishing despite the severe injury. The globally popular event draws voters from over 100 countries who follow the bears via live webcams.</p>

They were honored for their successful campaign to bring the issue of climate justice to the International Court of Justice, which resulted in an advisory opinion stating countries are legally obligated to address climate change. The prize, often called the "alternative Nobel," also recognized human rights lawyer Julian Aguon for developing the legal strategy.

          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team and former manager of Chelsea, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. Reflecting on her transition from club to international football, Hayes described the new role as thoroughly enjoyable and compared it to "becoming a grandparent," as she only works with players for short periods before they return to their clubs. Hayes, who led the US to an Olympic gold medal just months after taking the job, stated she was ready for the change and enjoys the strategic, long-term thinking her new position allows.</p>

          <h2>Transfer Fee Records in Women's Football Signal Growth and Widening Gaps</h2>

          <p>The world of women's soccer is experiencing unprecedented financial growth, evidenced by five separate world-record transfer fees being set in 2025 alone. This surge in spending, primarily from clubs in England's WSL and the US's NWSL, reflects increased visibility, marketability, and investment in the sport. However, this rapid commercialization is also raising concerns about a widening financial gap between the top-tier leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga. While the growth is a positive sign for the sport's ecosystem, experts warn it could create a class of super-clubs that dominate the competition, mirroring trends in the men's game.</p>

          <p>Following their unexpected T20 World Cup victory in 2024, the New Zealand women's cricket team is entering the 50-over World Cup with confidence, though they are not considered among the top favorites. All-rounder Melie Kerr stated that the team embraces its underdog status and believes the current group of players will be at their best over the next five to ten years. Despite inconsistent ODI form leading up to the tournament, the team is optimistic it can challenge top-ranked sides like Australia, India, and England, drawing on the momentum from their historic T20 championship win.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was in line with economists' expectations. The Reserve Bank of India is currently assessing the economic impact of previous rate cuts, noting that while inflation has moderated, global trade uncertainties could decelerate growth in the second half of the fiscal year. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee stated it was prudent to pause while also considering the effects of a recent goods and services tax cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New restrictions banning price and multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, on unhealthy food and drink have come into effect in England. The ban applies to supermarkets and other large retailers and is aimed at tackling the country's rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health officials have praised the long-overdue measure, arguing that such promotions do not save consumers money but instead encourage impulsive and excessive purchasing of items high in fat, salt, and sugar. The policy had been previously delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p>An assessment of Mark Rutte's first year as NATO's Secretary General highlights his critical role in navigating the alliance's relationship with a re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump. Taking office with the expectation of managing a precarious trans-Atlantic dynamic, Rutte has focused on persuading European allies to increase defense spending to meet Trump's demands. His diplomatic efforts have been credited with keeping the U.S. engaged with the alliance and preventing a potential withdrawal, though his methods have sometimes drawn criticism. The analysis suggests Rutte has successfully bought Europe time to bolster its own security capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new government mandate in England now requires every general practitioner's practice to offer patients the ability to book appointments online throughout the entire workday. This initiative is designed to end the frustrating "8am scramble," where patients repeatedly call to secure a slot, by providing a convenient digital alternative. In addition to booking non-urgent appointments, the online systems will allow patients to submit questions and symptoms for a callback. The move is part of a broader effort to modernize the NHS, improve patient access, and free up phone lines for more urgent cases.</p>

Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández each hit two homers, providing ample support for starting pitcher Blake Snell, who delivered a dominant seven-inning start. However, the team's victory was tempered by a shaky performance from its bullpen, which allowed three runs in the eighth inning, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the defending champions as they advance in the postseason.</p>
