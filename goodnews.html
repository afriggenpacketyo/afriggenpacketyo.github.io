          <p>AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches in 2024 can now file claims as part of a proposed $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches exposed the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of millions of current and former account holders. Eligible individuals could receive up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the incidents. The settlement awaits final court approval in December, with a deadline of November 18, 2025, for customers to submit their claims.</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to invent two new potential antibiotics that have successfully killed drug-resistant superbugs like gonorrhoea and MRSA in lab tests. The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs from scratch, a significant advancement from previous methods of screening existing chemicals. This breakthrough could herald a new era in antibiotic discovery, addressing the critical global health threat of antimicrobial resistance. While the compounds require years of further refinement and clinical trials, the approach demonstrates AI's potential to accelerate the development of life-saving medicines.</p>

          <p>A-level results across the UK revealed a slight increase in top grades (A* or A) to 28.3%, with a record number of 18-year-olds securing their first-choice university spot. The data also showed that boys outperformed girls in achieving top grades for the first time since 2018. However, a growing regional disparity in England was evident, with the gap between the highest-performing region, London, and the lowest, the North East, widening. These results reflect a system returning to pre-pandemic grading standards and highlight ongoing concerns about educational inequality.</p>

          <p>Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan has unofficially broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) in his SolarStratos aircraft. The five-hour flight over Switzerland saw the plane soar to an altitude where it crossed paths with a commercial airliner, symbolizing a potential future for decarbonized aviation. The team is now submitting the data for official validation and aims to eventually fly into the stratosphere using only solar power. This achievement marks a significant milestone in demonstrating the capabilities of renewable energy in aviation technology.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have spotted cottontail rabbits with alarming, horn-like growths on their faces, inspiring nicknames like "demon rabbits." However, wildlife officials have reassured the public that the animals are not dangerous and are simply infected with Shope papillomavirus. This common virus, spread by ticks and fleas, causes wart-like tumors that are typically harmless unless they obstruct the rabbit's ability to see or eat. The phenomenon is not new and is believed to have inspired the folklore of the jackalope in North America.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old school pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its 'Girls of the Year' for inventing a solar-powered heated blanket to help homeless individuals. Her design, conceived in a school engineering club, was developed into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales. Thirty-five of these blankets have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. For the honor, which is in partnership with Lego, Young was also depicted as a Lego mini-figure on a digital cover of the magazine.</p>

          <p>A woman from Manhattan, New York, successfully found a 2.30-carat colorless diamond at Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park, which she plans to use for her engagement ring. Micherre Fox discovered the gem on the final day of a month-long search at the park, the only place in the world where the public can search for diamonds at their original volcanic source. Her quest was driven by the symbolic desire to create her own ring through hard work rather than just purchasing one. The park confirmed it was the third-largest diamond found there this year.</p>

          <p>In a break from tradition, the International Olympic Committee has agreed to allow the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics to sell corporate naming rights for its venues. This historic decision abandons the long-standing "clean venue" policy, which prohibited commercial branding on fields of play and stadiums. The move is expected to generate significant new revenue to help cover the privately funded Games' $7.1 billion budget and will also simplify logistics by allowing existing venues to keep their well-known names. The field of play itself will remain free of visible sponsorships, preserving a core element of the policy.</p>

          <p>A 500-year-old manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés has been returned to Mexico by the FBI's art crime team. The document, dated February 20, 1527, outlines payments for an expedition and is considered a piece of protected cultural property. It was one of 15 pages discovered missing from Mexico's national archives in 1993. After being located within the U.S., the page was seized and repatriated, marking a successful recovery of a valuable piece of Mexican history, though no prosecutions will occur due to the time elapsed.</p>

          <p>Beijing's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has stated that both nations are prepared to move beyond simply stabilizing relations and aim for more productive economic cooperation. Speaking at a trade expo, he highlighted the potential for closer alignment between Australia's mining sector and China's manufacturing through joint exploration and technology sharing. This optimistic outlook follows a period of strained ties where Australian goods faced significant Chinese export curbs, which were only lifted at the end of last year. The comments suggest a mutual desire to rebuild and strengthen their crucial trade partnership.</p>
