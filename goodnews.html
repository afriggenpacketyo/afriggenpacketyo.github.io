The article asserts that the nation's democratic institutions have proven resilient, culminating in the fair election of President Lee Jae Myung. It also emphasizes the new administration's commitment to strengthening its strategic alliance with the United States, dismissing claims of democratic erosion or religious prejudice as unfounded mischaracterizations from some observers.</p>

He expressed hope that France would encourage the EU to maintain its strategic autonomy and adopt a correct perception of China. The discussions occurred amid ongoing mistrust related to the war in Ukraine, a significant trade deficit, and reciprocal trade frictions that have led to tariff impositions from both sides.</p>

          <p>The Bradford Bulls are set for a return to the top flight of rugby league for the first time in 11 years, securing promotion to the Super League for the 2026 season. Their promotion comes after they were awarded a high Grade B status under the sport's new grading system, which evaluates clubs on both on-field and off-field performance. Consequently, the Salford Red Devils, who received a lower grade amid financial difficulties and a poor season, will be relegated from the expanded 14-team league.</p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating how to control programmed cell death by manipulating specific proteins that can trigger a self-destruct mechanism within cells. This process, involving structures called "death fold" polymers, is crucial for health but can be dysregulated in diseases like Alzheimer's, where brain cells die too early, and cancer, where harmful cells fail to die. Scientists hope to develop treatments that could prolong the life of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases or induce death in tumor cells by modulating this fundamental cellular process.</p>

          <p>As U.S. health insurance premiums continue their steep rise, with family plans averaging over $25,500 annually, a small but notable number of companies are opting to cover the full premium costs for their employees. Firms like Boston Consulting Group and startups like Bartesian offer zero-premium health plans as a key benefit to attract and retain talent, viewing it as a strategic investment in a productive workforce. While this approach is uncommon, it highlights a potential solution for workers facing surging healthcare deductions from their paychecks.</p>

          <p>The concept of making public bus services free is gaining traction in cities like New York, but it has divided transit advocates. Proponents argue that fare-free systems increase accessibility, reduce boarding times, and can attract more riders, as seen in a pilot program in the Bronx. However, skeptics contend that the funds would be better spent on improving service frequency and reliability, which research suggests are higher priorities for riders, pointing to Kansas City's mixed results with its fare-free initiative.</p>

          <p>Scientific research indicates that women may need more sleep than men, with some studies suggesting up to 20 additional minutes per night. This difference is attributed to biological factors like hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, which affect sleep quality and duration. Social and structural factors, such as a disproportionate burden of domestic labor and non-traditional work shifts, also contribute to women experiencing higher rates of sleep debt and related health issues like exhaustion and brain fog.</p>
