          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% increase that surpassed market estimates. This significant growth is primarily attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients such as Nvidia and Apple. Buoyed by the ongoing AI boom, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure. The company's performance highlights the critical role of high-end semiconductors in the rapidly expanding AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer goods corporation Nestle has announced a significant restructuring plan that includes cutting 16,000 jobs over the next two years, a move that caused its shares to rise by nearly 8%. The decision is part of an accelerated cost-savings program under new CEO Philipp Navratil, aimed at improving operational efficiency and turning around the company's performance. Despite challenges in its Greater China business, the company reported better-than-expected organic growth in the third quarter. The job reductions are a key part of the new leadership's strategy to regain investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index hovered near the flatline, while major indices in the U.K., Germany, and France experienced slight declines at the opening bell. This choppy performance reflects ongoing market uncertainty, influenced by factors such as strong U.S. bank earnings, persistent trade tensions with China, and domestic political developments in France.

The deal, which will involve acquiring at least 42 aircraft, marks Indonesia's first purchase of Chinese warplanes and is supported by a nearly US$9 billion budget approved by the finance ministry. While the minister stated the jets would be "flying over Jakarta soon," a specific timeline for the purchase and delivery has not yet been detailed.

          <h2>Uruguay Becomes First Latin American Country to Legalize Euthanasia</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's Senate has passed a bill legalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to formally do so. The "Dignified Death" legislation allows mentally sound adult citizens in the terminal stage of an irreversible disease to opt for an assisted death administered by a healthcare professional. The bill, which had already passed the lower house with a large majority, reflects Uruguay's history of socially liberal policies in a predominantly Catholic region. The law has strong public support, with a recent poll showing over 60% of Uruguayans in favor of legal euthanasia.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in a year. This move comes as financial markets increasingly anticipate that the US Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts this year to address economic risks from trade tensions. A weaker dollar outlook generally strengthens other currencies like the yuan. The stronger fixing by the PBOC reflects these shifting global monetary policy expectations and influences currency trading in both onshore and offshore markets. (not investment advice)</p>
