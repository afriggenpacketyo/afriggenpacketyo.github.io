The collaboration was initially touted as a key strategy to drive foot traffic and boost Target's beauty category sales. The dissolution of the deal is seen as a potential setback for Target, which has faced declining sales and store traffic recently. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target, including theft and staffing, may have contributed to the decision to end the popular and once-promising retail arrangement.</p>

          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin has confirmed he is being considered for the position of Federal Reserve chair and stated his support for an aggressive interest rate cut. Sumerlin, a former senior economist in the George W. Bush administration, argued that a 50-basis-point cut is a "no-brainer" given the current economic conditions. His stance on monetary policy aligns with President Donald Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to lower rates. While expressing interest in the role, Sumerlin emphasized the importance of Fed independence and the need to be aligned with the president on the mission before accepting a potential nomination.

          <p>Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is launching her first Spanish-language radio ad in the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, focusing on an economic message to appeal to Latino voters. The ad highlights her commitment to lowering costs for families and criticizes her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policies. This move is part of a broader Democratic strategy to reconnect with Latino voters, a demographic where the party saw diminished support in the 2024 elections. The Virginia race is often seen as an early political bellwether following a presidential election.</p>

          <p>AI search company Perplexity has made a public offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. This move comes as Google awaits a judge's decision on potential divestitures following a landmark antitrust ruling that found the company holds a monopoly in the search market. The Department of Justice has previously called for Google to sell Chrome to foster a more competitive environment. While analysts are skeptical of the bid's seriousness, it highlights the significant regulatory pressure on Google and prompts valuation discussions for its various assets in the event of a forced breakup.

          <p>A $177 million settlement has been proposed to compensate millions of AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches announced in 2024. Eligible customers, whose personal information including Social Security numbers was exposed, can now file claims for up to $7,500 in documented losses. The settlement consolidates multiple class-action lawsuits filed against the company following the incidents. While the settlement awaits final court approval in December, impacted individuals can submit their claims online until the November 18 deadline, and notices are being emailed to those who qualify for compensation.</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to design two new potential antibiotics that have successfully killed drug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA and gonorrhea, in lab tests. Unlike previous AI methods that scanned existing chemicals, this approach designed the molecular structures of the drugs from the ground up. The development is hailed as a significant step in combating the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, which causes over a million deaths annually. While the new compounds require years of further testing before clinical use, the breakthrough suggests AI could usher in a new era of drug discovery.</p>

          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in top grades (A* or A), with 28.3% of entries achieving this mark. A record number of 18-year-olds secured a place at their first-choice university, with the most selective institutions seeing the steepest growth in acceptances. The results also revealed a widening regional gap in England, with students in London outperforming those in the North East by a significant margin. For the first time since 2018, boys slightly outperformed girls in achieving the highest grades, partly driven by results in popular subjects like mathematics.</p>

          <p>Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan has broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) in a flight over Switzerland. The SolarStratos aircraft, a lightweight carbon-fiber plane, completed the five-hour flight, even crossing paths with a commercial airliner. The team will now submit the flight data to the World Air Sports Federation for official validation of the new record. This achievement is a major milestone in the project's ultimate goal of making the first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, promoting the potential of renewable energy in aviation.</p>

          <p>A years-long federal investigation that began with a minor car accident in a small Tennessee town has resulted in the indictment of five leaders and enforcers of Mexico's United Cartels. The initial incident led investigators through wiretaps and surveillance to a major drug distribution network, uncovering a tractor-trailer containing 850 kilograms of methamphetamine. The Justice Department has now unsealed charges against top cartel figures, including leader Juan José Farías Álvarez, and is offering multimillion-dollar rewards for their capture. The case illustrates the direct link between violent international cartels and drug trafficking in local American communities.</p>

          <p>Rabbits with startling, horn-like growths spotted in Fort Collins, Colorado, are not a cause for alarm, according to wildlife officials. The animals are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, a common disease that causes keratinous warts to grow on their heads and faces. While visually grotesque, the virus is typically harmless to the rabbits unless the growths interfere with their ability to see or eat. The virus does not spread to humans or other animals, and it is believed to be the origin of the mythical "jackalope" folklore in North America.</p>

Her design, conceived in a school engineering club, won a national competition and was subsequently developed into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales. The devices have been distributed to Homeless Project Scotland for use in Glasgow. As part of the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also immortalized as a Lego mini-figure for the magazine's digital cover.</p>

          <p>A woman from Manhattan, New York, discovered a 2.30-carat colorless diamond during a visit to Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park. Micherre Fox had embarked on a month-long search at the park, which is the only place in the world where the public can search for diamonds at their original volcanic source. She found the gem on her last day and plans to have it set in her engagement ring, fulfilling a personal goal to find her own diamond rather than purchase one. The park confirmed it was the third-largest diamond found there this year.</p>
