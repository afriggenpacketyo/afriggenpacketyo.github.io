This significant commitment will provide over a gigawatt of AI compute capacity, solidifying Anthropic's infrastructure strategy across various vendors including Google, Amazon, and Nvidia. The AI company's annual revenue run rate is nearing $7 billion, driven by explosive growth in its Claude language models and agentic coding assistant.

The proposed "surge" of federal agents had sparked widespread condemnation and protests in the Bay Area. Trump confirmed the reversal on Truth Social, stating he would give the mayor a chance to address the situation. Local leaders, who had vowed legal challenges, emphasized ongoing mobilization of support networks for affected residents, despite the uncertain scope of the withdrawal.</p>

          <p>Gold prices recently experienced their largest single-day drop in over a decade, prompting questions about investment opportunities from retailers like Costco. This article suggests that purchasing gold during such dips is generally worthwhile, as declines are often temporary, and Costco offers a flexible, trustworthy path for physical bullion. While major gold investing companies provide wider options like IRAs and ETFs, buying physical gold from Costco allows for potential quick profits without shipping costs. However, Costco gold sales are final, requiring careful consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates are nearing a two-year low, averaging 8.11% on a 5-year loan, making them a potentially attractive borrowing option for homeowners. This article suggests that current rates are more favorable than many alternatives, like personal loans or credit cards, despite economic uncertainties. While further Federal Reserve rate cuts are anticipated, their impact on home equity loan rates is expected to be minimal. Locking in a low rate now offers financial stability and access to funds, with future refinancing possible if rates drop further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals mixed opinions among California voters regarding potential 2028 presidential runs for Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While a large number of California Democrats support Newsom's candidacy, overall state voters are more divided. Fewer than a third of state voters believe Harris should run, though she won her home state in 2024. The poll also indicates Californians believe the state sets a good example in technology and environment but struggles with housing, taxes, and economic policy, influencing political perceptions.</p>

This article advises homebuyers to consider acting now, despite elevated home prices, as rates are slowly declining and potential future drops might be minimal. It cautions against complacency, noting that rates could reverse course, and suggests that current market conditions might offer less competition than the traditional spring homebuying season next year. Buyers should weigh these factors carefully to decide if now is the opportune time to purchase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices are experiencing sharp fluctuations, creating opportunities for investors to capitalize on volatility. This article outlines three strategies: trading gold mining stocks or ETFs for leveraged exposure and liquidity, using gold-backed ETFs or futures for short-term plays, and strategically buying physical gold during dips for long-term hedging. Mining stocks offer higher leverage and easier trading than physical gold. Gold ETFs provide diversified exposure, while futures offer leveraged, high-risk trading for advanced investors. For tangible assets, dollar-cost averaging physical gold during dips is recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quantum computing stocks remained elevated despite the Trump administration denying "currently" negotiating equity stakes in companies like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. This denial leaves room for investor optimism, suggesting future talks or alternative deal structures like warrants.

Hyperscalers like Google and IBM already have significant quantum programs, highlighting the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
