          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and Gibraltar. The agreement ensures that travelers arriving at Gibraltar airport will undergo passport checks by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. The UK government asserts that the deal safeguards British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish officials also hailed the deal as historic. This agreement marks a significant step in resolving the complexities surrounding Gibraltar's border and its relationship with both the UK and the EU.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a trade deal with China is "done" following high-level talks in London, signaling a return to a trade framework reached in Geneva last month. China has characterized the talks as "reasonable" and "frank," emphasizing the importance of both sides upholding their commitments. Trump stated that American tariffs on Chinese goods will increase to 55%, while Chinese tariffs on American goods will be set at 10%. As part of the agreement, China will reportedly supply rare earth minerals upfront, addressing a key point of contention between the two countries, according to Trump's statement on Truth Social.</p>

Trump also indicated that China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, consistent with the temporary rollback of retaliatory duties agreed upon last month. Lutnick's comments provide clarity on the immediate tariff situation, even as broader trade negotiations continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old man from New Jersey sustained minor injuries after being gored by a bison in Yellowstone National Park. This incident marks the second bison-related injury in a month, highlighting the dangers of approaching the animals. Park officials remind visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from large animals like bison, elk, and moose, and at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and cougars. Bison can be aggressive when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. increased slightly in May, with a rise in grocery prices offsetting lower gasoline prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in the 12 months through May, up from 2.3% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists anticipate that President Trump's tariff policy will likely raise consumer prices in the coming months, with some already seeing early evidence of their impact. Despite the overall tame inflation, the potential effects of tariffs remain a concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold has become the world's second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal, according to a report by the European Central Bank. Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar as their biggest reserve holding. Emerging and developing countries are increasingly attracted to gold due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. However, there are signs that central bank purchases may cool in the months ahead, despite the many tailwinds that have propelled gold prices.</p>

The hole has been a talking point for decades, with its length exceeding the average drive of PGA Tour players in some years.
