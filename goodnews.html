          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 14:24:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification for domestic flights or accessing federal facilities, which require a Real ID or other approved document. This clarification follows a rumor that Costco cards could be used as a form of identification at airports, prompting the TSA to address the issue on social media. While a Costco card might help establish a baseline identity during the identity verification process if a traveler has lost their ID, it does not replace the need for an acceptable form of identification. Acceptable forms of identification include passports, U.S. Department of Defense IDs, and DHS trusted traveler cards. This announcement is intended to prevent delays at airport security checkpoints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's initial lawsuit alleging sexual harassment on the set of their film "It Ends With Us." Baldoni's suit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career by promoting a false narrative. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to prove Lively's threats regarding film promotion constituted extortion and that he hadn't demonstrated defamation since Lively's statements were privileged under her lawsuit. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while Baldoni has been given until June 23 to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference. This ruling comes after Lively withdrew claims of emotional distress in her suit against Baldoni.</p>

          <p>Employment attorney Diane Seltzer overwhelmingly won the election to lead the D.C. Bar Association, defeating securities lawyer Brad Bondi in a contest marked by record voter turnout. Seltzer received over 90 percent of the electronic vote, emphasizing the rule of law as a central theme of her campaign. The election became a focal point for broader clashes within the American legal system, partly due to Bondi's connection as the brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi expressed disappointment that the race became politicized, lamenting the shift away from focusing on training programs and pro bono work for lawyers. Seltzer's victory signifies a renewed focus on upholding legal principles and ensuring lawyers can safely represent their clients.</p>

          <p>Walmart's majority-owned fintech startup, OnePay, is launching a pair of credit cards in partnership with Synchrony, marking a new direction in its financial services strategy. Synchrony will issue the cards and handle underwriting decisions, while OnePay manages the customer experience through its mobile app. This move follows Walmart's lawsuit against Capital One, which allowed the retailer to exit their credit card partnership early. The Walmart card program previously had 10 million customers and $8.5 billion in loans outstanding. This arrangement indicates that Walmart is choosing to collaborate with established players to accelerate its growth in the financial services sector.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing anti-diversity and anti-transgender executive orders related to grant funding requirements. The judge ruled that the government cannot force recipients to halt programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion or acknowledge transgender individuals. The plaintiffs, including health centers and LGBTQ+ services groups, argued that the executive orders infringe on free speech rights. This decision is a victory for LGBTQ+ organizations and other groups that rely on federal funding to support their missions, ensuring they can continue their work without censorship.
