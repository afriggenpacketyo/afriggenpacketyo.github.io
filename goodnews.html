          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, a senior Roman Catholic leader, described the conclave to elect Pope Leo XIV as an "immensely peaceful" experience. He noted the absence of politicking and rancor among the cardinals during the highly secretive meeting in the Sistine Chapel. Cardinal Nichols also mentioned the unexpected benefit of being disconnected from the outside world, which allowed for more prayer and reflection. The conclave followed the death of Pope Francis and involved 133 cardinals who were sealed off from communication until a new Pope was chosen.</p>

          <p>The Langenhop family's three children, Ava, Olivia, and Landon, were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare disorder that impairs white blood cell function and leaves patients vulnerable to infections. Traditional treatment options were limited, but the family enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. The therapy involved modifying the children's stem cells to correct the genetic defect and then reintroducing them into their bodies. Five years after treatment, all three children are thriving and living normal lives, marking a significant success for the experimental therapy.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Catalonia, Spain, lifted an order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. The fire, which originated at a swimming pool cleaning products firm in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, prompted the Civil Protection service to urge residents to stay indoors. Fire services stabilized the blaze and reported no casualties. The warehouse owner suggested a lithium battery might have caused the fire, emphasizing the challenges in extinguishing chlorine fires.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is challenging its classification as "confirmed right-wing extremist" by the German domestic intelligence agency, BfV. The BfV has temporarily put its reclassification on hold, complying with a "standstill commitment" requested by the AfD. While AfD leaders claim this as a step towards exoneration, the BfV maintains its classification is correct and has only suspended the designation to allow the court time for review. Experts emphasize that the standstill order is a routine administrative procedure and does not indicate the AfD's likelihood of success in overturning the classification.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean near Jakarta, Indonesia. This event serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. The return of Kosmos-482 highlights the enduring legacy of early space exploration efforts, even as modern missions focus on Mars and other destinations.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have denounced her inclusion in a legal dispute between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively as a tabloid clickbait attempt. The dispute centers around script re-writes for the film *It Ends With Us*, where Lively allegedly used Swift and her husband Ryan Reynolds as "dragons" during discussions with Baldoni. Swift's representatives stated that she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions and never saw or made notes on the film. The legal battle involves accusations of sexual harassment, defamation, and civil extortion between Lively and Baldoni.</p>

          <p>Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar have introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA) to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill seeks to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, allowing federal funds for research on Schedule I substances. Experts suggest the bill could garner bipartisan support, enabling policymakers to craft effective legislation based on evidence rather than ideology. The legislation aims to address the federal government's current inability to scientifically measure cannabis' impact on various social and health outcomes.</p>
