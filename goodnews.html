          <p>Lost items in Japan are finding their way back to their owners faster thanks to the integration of artificial intelligence in lost-and-found services. A "lost-and-found platform" developed by Find Inc. is now used by approximately 30 organizations, including transportation services and police departments, at around 2,300 locations. The system uses AI to categorize and catalog lost items based on photos taken by staff, enabling owners to inquire through messaging apps by providing descriptions or similar-looking images. This has significantly improved the efficiency and return rate of lost possessions, with one railway operator seeing an increase from less than 10% to 30% after adopting the system.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce his first trade agreement since implementing tariffs that previously unsettled markets. The announcement, teased on social media, will involve a "BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY," with representatives present at the Oval Office. Since April 2, Trump's administration has engaged in trade talks with several countries following the imposition of a 10% tariff on all imported goods and "reciprocal tariffs." While the tariffs were paused for 90 days, except for China, economists have cautioned about potential shortages and increased consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that complying with the order could cost the company "substantial sums." The court had found Apple in contempt for violating a previous order regarding in-app purchase commissions and restrictions on app developers. Apple claims that allowing developers to link to external payment options reduces consumer choice and harms its business. The company also faces accusations of misleading the court during the trial, but this filing does not address those accusations directly.</p>

          <p>Kavan Markwood, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet at PNC Park, is recovering "ahead of schedule" according to doctors and family. Markwood sustained injuries to his skull, brain, spine, ribs, and lungs, but has progressed positively, is off the breathing machine, and has left the intensive care unit. Doctors believe cognitive rehab will be one of the most critical aspects of his recovery.

In Boise, the mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag, reacting to Idaho‚Äôs House Bill 96 which restricted flags to a limited list.</p>
