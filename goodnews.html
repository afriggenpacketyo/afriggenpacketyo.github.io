        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto moves through the Atlantic, there is a possibility it could interact with another developing storm system, potentially leading to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two storms get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging or altering each other's paths. While forecasts currently predict Humberto will not make landfall, this potential interaction is being monitored by meteorologists. However, they note that a significant interaction is unlikely given the distance and difference in strength between the two systems.</p>

          <p>The iconic film "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is celebrating its 50th anniversary, with its legacy kept alive by dedicated fan groups and shadow cast performances around the world. These events provide a unique, immersive experience where fans dress up, act out scenes, and participate in call-and-response rituals. For many, particularly within the queer and neurodivergent communities, these screenings have evolved into a cherished safe space and a refuge. The tradition celebrates individuality and has fostered a strong sense of community that continues to thrive five decades later.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pushing for an ambitious youth migration agreement with the European Union, which would allow individuals aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK for a set period. The proposal aims to boost economic growth and improve the public finances ahead of the autumn Budget. Reeves hopes the Office for Budget Responsibility will factor the potential positive economic impact of such a scheme into its official forecasts. The plan has faced criticism from opponents who view it as a partial return to the freedom of movement that ended with Brexit.</p>

          <p>An iconic street in Beverly Hills, famous for its picturesque rows of palm trees, has become a hotspot for tourists and social media influencers, leading to public safety concerns. Residents report that visitors frequently stand in the middle of the road to take photos, obstructing traffic and creating dangerous situations. The increase in this activity, largely driven by platforms like TikTok and Instagram, has prompted the Beverly Hills police to step up patrols in the area to prevent accidents and enforce traffic laws.</p>

          <p>This opinion column reflects on recent anecdotes from actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro, who were both advised to adopt less "ethnic" stage names early in their careers. The author uses a short fable about a struggling actor who repeatedly changes his appearance to mirror others, only to be told by a mystical taco vendor that the key to success is being himself. The piece concludes by celebrating the fact that both actors rejected the pressure and succeeded with their given names.</p>

          <h2>Surveys Reveal Growing Use of AI in Education by Both Teachers and Students</h2>

          <p>Recent surveys show a significant surge in the use of artificial intelligence in educational settings among both students and educators. Teachers are reportedly using AI tools primarily for lesson preparation and streamlining routine tasks, while students are leveraging them for explaining concepts and summarizing articles. Despite the benefits, educators remain concerned about the potential for increased plagiarism and a decline in student creativity. Students, in turn, worry about being falsely accused of academic misconduct and the unreliability of AI-generated information.</p>

          <p>Despite a successful recent test flight of its Starship rocket, SpaceX faces significant challenges ahead for the ambitious program. A lunar lander version of Starship is a critical component of NASA's Artemis mission to return astronauts to the moon, but a safety panel has expressed doubts that it will be ready for the targeted mid-2027 launch. The company is also confronting environmental opposition to its plans for increased launch frequency and must still demonstrate complex in-orbit refueling capabilities essential for the lunar mission.</p>

          <p>The imminent expiration of a major federal tax credit for electric vehicles has triggered a rush of buyers looking to capitalize on the savings before a new policy from the Trump administration takes effect. Consumers have only days left to receive a $7,500 credit for a new EV, leading to a significant spike in sales, with some regions seeing the market share of EVs jump dramatically. Auto dealers and industry analysts note the short-term boom but warn of a likely sharp decline in EV sales once the incentive is eliminated.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a tradition that began in 1841 as an agricultural competition, has transformed into a massive cultural and entertainment event. While early fairs focused on showcasing livestock and farming innovations, modern iterations have become pop-up theme parks featuring live music, amusement rides, and an extensive variety of deep-fried foods. Despite this evolution, the fairs have maintained their agricultural roots, continuing to celebrate local crafts, produce, and the farming community, contributing significantly to the U.S. economy each year.</p>

          <p>The UK government's forthcoming plans for a new generation of towns are being shaped by the long-held architectural and urban planning principles of King Charles. Officials have indicated that these new developments will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" designs like terraced housing over high-rise buildings. This approach aligns with the King's advocacy for traditional, community-focused building styles, as demonstrated in his projects like Poundbury, signaling a shift in mainstream urban design.</p>
