          <p>Grocery delivery company Instacart reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, leading to a significant rise in its stock price. The company also issued strong guidance for the upcoming quarter, projecting gross transaction value to surpass forecasts. This positive financial report comes as outgoing CEO Fidji Simo prepares to step down, with business chief Chris Rogers set to take over. Instacart attributed its success partly to the integration of artificial intelligence for improved personalization and feature development, despite a slight decrease in average order value.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate economic advisor Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, filling a vacancy left by Adriana Kugler. Miran, a past critic of the Fed's stimulus actions and a proponent of devaluing the dollar, is seen as an appointment that aligns with the president's push for lower interest rates. The nomination is considered a temporary move, allowing the administration to keep its options open for the next Fed Chair. Miran's confirmation by the Senate is not expected until September at the earliest.</p>

          <p>England opener Zak Crawley delivered a stellar performance, scoring an unbeaten 67 runs to guide the Northern Superchargers to an eight-wicket victory against the Welsh Fire in The Hundred cricket tournament. After restricting the Fire to a modest total of 143-9, the Superchargers chased down the target with 11 balls remaining. Crawley's powerful batting, which included a crucial 91-run opening partnership with Dawid Malan, ensured a comfortable win for his team. The Fire's innings lost momentum after a strong start, with key wickets taken by Superchargers' bowlers Matthew Potts and Adil Rashid.</p>

          <p>Southern California grocery chain Stater Bros. has reached a tentative three-year contract agreement with the union representing 12,000 of its employees, successfully averting a potential strike. The deal, which awaits ratification by union members, reportedly includes higher wages, improved healthcare, and increased pension contributions. Negotiations had been tense for months, with the union filing charges of unfair labor practices and organizing boycotts. The resolution aligns Stater Bros. with other major regional grocery chains that recently settled similar contracts with their unionized workforces.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared with President Trump to announce a four-year, $600 billion spending plan in the United States, focusing on expanding relationships with American suppliers for components like glass and sensors. The move is seen as a strategic effort to appease the administration's desire for U.S. manufacturing without committing to the final assembly of iPhones domestically, which Cook stated will remain elsewhere for now. The announcement was paired with news that Apple would be exempt from a planned tariff on chips, a development that boosted the company's stock price significantly.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction at the 'Alligator Alcatraz' immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from conservation groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the project proceeded without required environmental impact studies and threatens a fragile ecosystem. While the facility can continue to operate and house detainees, the 14-day order prevents any new paving or infrastructure work. The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges facing the facility, which has also been criticized for its conditions and purpose.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their lawsuit against the state's Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to proceed. The lawsuit challenges the CPUC's 2022 decision to drastically cut incentives for new rooftop solar panel owners. An appeals court had previously dismissed the case, deferring to the commission's expertise, but the Supreme Court's unanimous decision rejected that standard of review. The environmental groups argue the cuts violate state law and undermine California's goal of achieving carbon-free energy, while utilities contend the old system unfairly shifted costs to non-solar customers.</p>

The review notes that the film's primary appeal is the reunion and strong chemistry between its original stars, rather than its hastily sketched plot. While the movie is described as a "disposable delight" that doesn't surpass the 2003 original, it succeeds by leveraging the charm of its cast and numerous comedic cameos.</p>

This has led the club to inquire about Brighton's Carlos Baleba, a player whose energy and defensive capabilities match the team's needs.
