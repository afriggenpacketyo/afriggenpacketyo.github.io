          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after a five-month stay aboard the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, completed over 200 scientific experiments during their 146 days in orbit. Their mission also involved replacing the Crew-9 astronauts who had been stranded on the station for an extended period due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule. The return marks the successful conclusion of NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, predating the Earth by about 20 million years. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which originated from a larger meteor that exploded over the state in June. The analysis suggests the meteorite belongs to a group of asteroids from the main belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely from a larger asteroid breakup 470 million years ago. Scientists have proposed naming it the McDonough Meteorite, marking the 27th such recovery in Georgia.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made an emotional return to Old Trafford, playing for visiting team Fiorentina in a pre-season friendly. De Gea, who left United in 2023 after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd, providing a farewell he was not afforded at the time of his departure. The match itself ended in a 1-1 draw, with United winning a subsequent penalty shootout. De Gea expressed his gratitude for the reception, reflecting on his time at the club and the ongoing debate about the decision to replace him.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock saw a significant surge this week after the company successfully navigated complex tariff negotiations with the Trump administration. The tech giant pledged to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, which includes funding for expansions at its U.S. suppliers like Corning. In response, President Trump announced that Apple would be exempt from a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, stating, "If you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." This move provided a major boost to Apple's stock, which had been struggling, and highlighted the pivotal role of corporate strategy in current trade politics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from their shared border, a potential de-escalation measure. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers earlier in the week, which had been broadcasting anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaigns have been a source of tension for years, and their removal signals a possible, albeit fragile, step toward easing hostilities. The move comes amid a broader diplomatic stalemate, with Pyongyang recently rebuffing Seoul's overtures for improved relations.</p>

          <p>A development team has completed a $104 million project to convert the abandoned 19th-century campus of St. John's College in Brooklyn into a 205-unit luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church and undertook extensive renovations, preserving historic details like exposed brick while adding modern amenities. The project includes 62 affordable housing units available via a city lottery, alongside market-rate apartments. The conversion has been embraced by the neighborhood for revitalizing a long-neglected historic property and turning it into a functional part of the community.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Known for his integrity and troubleshooting skills, Webster was appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 to restore its reputation after a period of scandal. He was later chosen by President Reagan in 1987 to lead the CIA in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair, where he worked to rebuild trust with Congress. His long career in public service was defined by his role as an apolitical outsider tasked with stabilizing the nation's key security agencies during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>A major museum exhibition is shedding new light on the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her time, even more famous than Rembrandt during her life. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, Ruysch had unique access to exotic specimens, which she depicted in intricate, dramatic still lifes set against dark backgrounds. Despite the challenges faced by women artists, she achieved immense success, becoming a court painter and winning the lottery. The exhibition explores her refined technique and the scientific, aesthetic, and moral dimensions of her work.</p>

          <h2>Scientist Affirms Bermuda Triangle Disappearances Are Explained by Probability and Environment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki reiterates the long-held scientific consensus that there is no mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the region means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is no different than any other well-traveled area of the ocean. This explanation, supported by institutions like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, points to a combination of human error and challenging environmental factors. These factors include the volatile weather of the Gulf Stream and potential magnetic compass anomalies, which sufficiently explain the incidents without resorting to supernatural theories.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins suggests that parents who are constantly on their phones may be modeling behavior that hinders their children's development and success. Speaking from personal experience, Robbins noted that children often mirror their parents' screen habits, which can lead to issues with attention, sleep, and mental health. She advises parents to first address their own phone usage, such as not keeping it on their person at home or sleeping with it. By modeling a balanced relationship with technology and showing curiosity about their kids' online activities rather than judgment, parents can foster better connections and healthier habits.</p>
