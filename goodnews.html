Chinese analysts suggest a more pragmatic approach, focusing on adapting to the conservative turn in American politics. The protests and the upcoming midterm elections could create an opportunity for eased tensions or warmer ties between China and the US. This shift in focus could potentially lead to a period of reduced pressure in the relationship between the two global powers.</p>
