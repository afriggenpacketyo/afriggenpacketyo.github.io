          <p>Tiffany Stratton successfully defended her WWE Women's Championship against Jade Cargill in a hard-fought match at SummerSlam. The bout, which was the first SummerSlam appearance for both competitors, featured a series of high-impact moves and dramatic reversals. After Cargill nearly secured victory with her finisher "Jaded," Stratton managed to get her foot on the ropes to break the pin. Stratton then countered a top-rope maneuver from Cargill to hit her own finisher for the win, extending her title reign.</p>

She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, leaving behind her husband and two young children, one of whom was an infant she was still breastfeeding. Her detention stemmed from an old deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother missed an immigration hearing years ago. Clouatre is now reunited with her family but must wear an ankle monitor as her case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme. The plot allegedly involved inflating prices on state contracts for military drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, praising the agencies for their work. The arrests come shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests, a move seen as crucial for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially a radical idea for "programmable money," it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are increasingly building on Ethereum, valuing its stability for tokenizing assets. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's staggering growth while emphasizing the need to maintain its decentralized principles as it becomes mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like their race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, as these do not constitute reasonable suspicion of being in the country illegally. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over Trump administration sweeps that caused widespread fear in Southern California. The decision affirms that such practices violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana have launched a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. The yet-unnamed party claims to have over 600,000 registered supporters, who will be invited to help choose a name that reflects the movement's values. Political experts note the importance of a modern, resonant brand name in today's digital age, as traditional party labels may not connect with younger voters. The party cannot field candidates for election until it registers an official name with the Electoral Commission.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have formally committed to Luka Doncic as the franchise's centerpiece by signing him to a major contract extension. This move, while expected, intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article suggests that by anointing the 26-year-old Doncic as the undisputed leader, the team has created an uneasy dynamic with the 40-year-old James, who is accustomed to being the focal point. How James adapts to this new hierarchy will be a critical storyline for the team moving forward.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has stated that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue comedy. A qualified doctor, Hill felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking bad news to patients. Witnessing his stepfather pass away before getting to enjoy retirement solidified his resolve to pursue a different path, one he felt his stepfather might have disapproved of. Hill found fame with shows like "TV Burp" but does not miss the stress of its weekly production schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed "Winston," a platypus gifted to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Australia during World War II. The animal died just days before reaching England, and for decades, it was rumored to have died from shell-shock during an encounter with a German U-boat. However, new analysis of archival records, including the attendant's logbook, reveals the true cause was likely extreme heat. As the ship crossed the equator, temperatures in the platypus's enclosure rose well beyond safe levels, essentially cooking the creature alive.</p>
