          <p>Following the death of Representative Gerry Connolly, House Democrats are vying for the ranking member position on the House Oversight Committee, a role that carries significant investigative power and public visibility. Four candidates‚ÄîStephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfume‚Äîare in the running, each bringing different strengths to the table. Democrats are considering factors such as communication skills, ability to support lawmakers in battleground districts, and strategies for challenging President Trump. The vote is scheduled for June 24, and the outcome remains uncertain as various caucuses weigh their options, balancing seniority with the need for fresh perspectives and effective leadership. Optimism around the Democratic Party's ability to challenge Trump will be influenced by their choice. The position offers the possibility of becoming chair if the party wins back the majority in next year's midterm elections.</p>

          <h2>Japan Aims for Tariff Deal Progress with U.S., Prioritizing National Interests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 01:37:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated Japan's intention to advance tariff negotiations with the United States, emphasizing that national interests would not be compromised for a quick agreement. This announcement precedes a potential meeting between Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump at the upcoming G7 leaders' summit in Canada. Japan's chief tariff negotiator is expected to hold further discussions with the U.S., pushing for a mutually beneficial deal that recognizes Japan's increased investment and job creation in the United States. Ishiba's remarks followed U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's indication that the U.S. might extend its pause on reciprocal tariffs if negotiations proceed in good faith, as the imposition of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars, auto parts, steel, and aluminum has already caused uncertainty about how Japan's export-driven economy will fare. Japan faces a reciprocal tariff rate of 24 percent, including the 10 percent baseline duty already in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda broadcasts along the inter-Korean border, marking a step towards easing tensions with North Korea under the new liberal government. The broadcasts, which resumed last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons, were halted as part of President Lee Jae-myung's efforts to restore trust and promote peace. This decision follows Lee's campaign promise to end the broadcasts, which he argued created unnecessary tensions for residents in border towns. While North Korea has not yet commented, South Korea has also called for civilian activists to stop flying propaganda leaflets across the border, though prospects for early dialogue remain dim due to stalled nuclear talks and North Korea's focus on relations with Russia.</p>

Frankie O'Reilly, who lost his partner Georgie to an Aids-related illness, participated in the project to cope with his grief and remember the brave people he knew. The exhibition, initiated by author Charlie Porter, aims to provide a space for grieving and to raise awareness about the ongoing impact of HIV.</p>
