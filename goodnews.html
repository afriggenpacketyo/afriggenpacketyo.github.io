          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in April and March. This surge has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate the cost of this staple food. Japan's core inflation rate also climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest level since January 2023, with rice significantly contributing to this inflation. Experts suggest that government measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if extended to processed foods and restaurant prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and lacking specificity, emphasizing that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds.

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being reimagined as a space for healing, art, and reparative history, moving away from romanticizing the antebellum era. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation collaborates with 1504, a narrative studio, to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities through creative storytelling. The initiative involves descendants of both enslavers and the enslaved in dialogue, fostering honest conversations and acknowledging the horrors of racial violence. The transformation aims to connect with a new generation, emphasizing shared humanity through art and remembrance.</p>
