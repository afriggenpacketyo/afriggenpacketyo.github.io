          <p>Suga, the final member of the K-Pop group BTS to complete South Korea's mandatory military service, has been discharged, paving the way for the band's potential reunion. Suga began his service in 2023 and served as a social service agent. He expressed gratitude to fans for their patience and apologized for causing concern last year, referencing a fine he received for drunk driving on an electric scooter. Fans are eagerly anticipating a comeback from BTS, which has been on hiatus since 2022 while its members fulfilled their military duties. The band is expected to hold its largest-ever world tour in 2026, according to an NH Securities entertainment analyst.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to map the DNA of every newborn baby to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, with a ¬£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Screening will involve sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples shortly after birth, searching for gene disorders that develop in early childhood and have effective treatments. The health secretary stated that this technology would enable personalized healthcare, reducing pressure on NHS services and helping people live longer, healthier lives. The initiative will also support Genomics England in building one of the world's largest research databases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese brands are increasingly leveraging advertising and sports sponsorships to enhance their presence and reputation in the European market. Xiaomi, for example, is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, with a goal of 10,000 overseas stores in the next five years. This expansion follows a period of adjustment in Xiaomi's retail strategy, which included closing stores in France to focus on online sales and partnerships with retailers. The shift reflects a broader trend among Chinese companies to improve their image and appeal to European consumers through strategic marketing and brand building.</p>

          <p>Towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to encourage people to relocate and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme provides individuals the chance to live in cities like Guben for up to four weeks without charge. Guben, for example, has seen its population decline by nearly half since 1995, and the median age is rising, prompting the city to seek new residents. While the far-right AfD party has a significant presence in some of these areas, efforts are underway to create a welcoming culture and attract skilled workers to fill job vacancies. The scheme includes opportunities to participate in community events and internships at local companies.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina. While the Lions displayed ambition and created opportunities, their execution was lacking, with errors and missed connections hindering their performance. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration with the compounded errors and inability to set the desired pace. The team's attack felt disjointed, with offloads going to ground or into Argentine hands, and passes not quite reaching their targets. Farrell emphasized the need for sharper play as they continue their tour in Australia.</p>
