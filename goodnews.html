          <p>Caitlin Clark voiced her frustration with WNBA referees after a controversial no-call in the Indiana Fever's 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty. In the game's final seconds, Clark believed she was fouled by Natasha Cloud, who leaned into her, causing her to lose the ball, but no foul was called, ending the game. The no-call prevented Clark from potentially tying or winning the game at the free-throw line and denied her a chance at a 20-point, 10-rebound game, a milestone she narrowly missed. Cloud has previously addressed physical plays against Clark, stating that the backlash is rooted in racism.</p>

          <p>French authorities are investigating a power outage in southeast France, suspecting arson may have played a role, which disrupted the Cannes Film Festival's closing celebrations. The outage, affecting approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, was caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes and a fallen high-voltage line. Despite the disruption, Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony and all scheduled events would proceed as planned, utilizing an independent power supply. Laurent Hottiaux, the prefect for the area, condemned the acts and stated that all resources are being mobilized to find the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. About 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas lost power early on Saturday, but power was restored in the afternoon. Officials reported that an electricity substation had been set on fire and a pylon at another location damaged. Despite the disruption, organizers of the film festival confirmed the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to an alternative power supply.</p>

          <p>More than a century after it sank off the coast of San Diego, the U.S. submarine USS F-1 has been captured in unprecedented images, revealing its final resting place. The high-definition pictures were taken by interagency teams using advanced deep-sea imaging technology. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship in 1917, resulting in the loss of 19 crew members. This expedition marks the first close-up survey of the submarine, offering detailed views and 3-D models of the wreck.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania, admits to feeling pressured to return to his Senate duties after facing scrutiny over his mental health and absenteeism. Fetterman expressed frustration over being "shamed" into fulfilling senatorial duties like attending committee work and casting procedural votes, which he considers a waste of time. He attributes the increased scrutiny to his openness about his mental health struggles, which he believes has been "weaponized" against him. Despite his reservations, Fetterman has started attending hearings and votes to prove his capability to perform his job.</p>

          <p>French authorities have determined that a power outage in Cannes during the film festival was caused by sabotage, including arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower. The outage left approximately 160,000 homes without power for hours, briefly disrupting screenings. Film festival organizers stated that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to a backup power system. Local prosecutors have opened investigations into the sabotage, but it is not yet clear if the film festival was the intended target.</p>
