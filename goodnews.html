          <p>Spirit Airlines is making significant progress in its revitalization efforts, securing up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing and an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor, subject to court approval. The budget carrier filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in under a year due to high costs and weak demand, leading to plans to cut 40 routes and furlough a third of its flight attendants. Spirit aims to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases to reduce costs. CEO Dave Davis expressed gratitude to stakeholders, emphasizing these steps are crucial for building a stronger, future-proof airline.</p>

          <p>Pfizer's recent acquisition, Metsera, is showing early promise in the obesity drug market, with encouraging mid-stage trial data for its lead injection, MET-097i. Pfizer's up to $7.3 billion deal for Metsera aims to bolster its presence in the lucrative weight-loss sector. The data suggests MET-097i can achieve significant weight loss, up to 14.1% in 28 weeks, with potentially fewer gastrointestinal side effects than existing GLP-1 drugs, and a monthly dosing advantage. While further late-stage trials are needed, analysts project Metsera's candidates could generate over $5 billion in peak annual sales.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally by revoking visas, arresting, detaining, and deporting foreign students and faculty engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy. Judge William Young, in a scathing 161-page ruling, found that the State and Homeland Security Departments misused their powers to chill free speech on college campuses, violating the First Amendment rights of non-citizens. Young criticized the administration's actions as part of broader efforts to limit free speech, and condemned ICE for using masked agents during arrests, likening it to a "masked secret police." The ruling affirms First Amendment protections for noncitizens, though the administration continues to pursue deportations.</p>

          <p>The undeniable rebound in Wall Street dealmaking, highlighted by Goldman Sachs advising on Electronic Arts' massive $55 billion leveraged buyout, signals a bullish outlook for the firm's investors. This development, coupled with Jefferies' record-breaking third-quarter revenue driven by strong dealmaking, bodes well for Goldman's investment banking division. After a period of reduced activity due to high interest rates and regulatory uncertainty, a more relaxed business environment under the current administration is fueling a resurgence in IPO and M&A activity. Goldman Sachs shares have already reflected this bounce, with the article noting the firm's continued dominance in M&A advisory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California-based startup Aetherflux is advancing the concept of space-based solar farms, planning to launch low-orbit satellites next year that use infrared lasers to wirelessly transmit collected solar power to small ground stations on Earth. Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt, Aetherflux's CEO, explains this distributed power generation approach allows for smaller ground collection spots. Initially partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense to solve battlefield power problems, the company aims to scale quickly to broader markets with backing from investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
