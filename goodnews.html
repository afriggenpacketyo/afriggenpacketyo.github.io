          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual economic forum in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he will navigate a complex economic landscape. Powell faces the delicate task of addressing both political pressure from the Trump administration to cut interest rates and mixed economic data showing slowing job growth alongside rising inflation. Investors and economists will be closely watching for any signals regarding the Fed's next interest-rate decision in September, though Powell is expected to maintain a data-dependent stance. The speech is seen as a critical moment for the central bank's policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has publicly stated that Beijing stands firmly with New Delhi in opposition to recent U.S. tariffs, which have targeted both nations. Speaking at a summit, the envoy condemned the U.S. for using tariffs as a "bargaining chip" and described the policy as bullying, calling for collaboration between the two Asian powers to uphold the multilateral trading system. This rare display of solidarity occurs as both countries navigate an aggressive trade environment shaped by the Trump administration's policies, which have been criticized for undermining free trade principles.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced a price increase for its Apple TV+ streaming service in the United States, raising the monthly subscription cost from $9.99 to $12.99. The annual subscription price will remain unchanged at $99.99. This change is effective immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers will see the new price applied 30 days after their next renewal date. This marks the second price hike for the service in less than two years, following a previous increase in October 2023, as the company continues to invest in original content for its platform.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:43:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution. To qualify for such programs, which involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount, borrowers typically need to meet specific criteria. These often include having a substantial amount of unsecured debt, usually over $7,500, and experiencing a significant financial hardship such as job loss or a medical emergency. Borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are also more likely to be considered, as creditors become more willing to negotiate to avoid a total loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Survey Finds Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Order from Kids' Menus to Save Money</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey reveals that approximately 44% of American adults are ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants as a strategy to manage costs and control portion sizes. This trend reflects growing economic pressure on consumers, who are increasingly seeking ways to reduce their spending on dining out. The lower prices and smaller, simpler meal options typically found on kids' menus are proving to be an attractive alternative for budget-conscious adults. The finding aligns with recent reports from fast-food chains like McDonald's, which have noted a slowdown in sales attributed to financial uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>Booming Data Center Demand Creates Shortage of Skilled Trade Workers</h2>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, is creating a significant labor shortage in the skilled trades. Companies are struggling to find enough qualified electricians, HVAC technicians, and plumbers to build and maintain these critical facilities. This demand is intensifying competition for a shrinking pool of blue-collar workers, as many in the younger generation pursue college and white-collar careers over trade professions. With hundreds of thousands of skilled trade jobs currently unfilled, experts warn the gap could widen substantially in the coming decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors. This increase is attributed to a significant rise in housing inventory, which climbed to its highest level since May 2020, giving buyers more options and helping to moderate price growth. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point after a long period of rapid appreciation. The improved affordability and choice are beginning to draw some buyers back into the market. (not investment advice)</p>
