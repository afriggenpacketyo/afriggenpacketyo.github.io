          <p>Dr. Allen Frances, a key figure in shaping psychiatric diagnostic criteria, reflects on the significant increase in autism diagnoses over the past few decades. In a recent discussion, he explains how changes he helped implement in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) contributed to broadening the definition of autism. This expansion has led to a 60-fold rise in reported rates, a development Frances suggests was an unforeseen consequence of attempts to improve diagnostic accuracy for the condition.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old in Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that could cure her life-threatening inherited condition, APDS. The disorder, which severely weakens the immune system, was responsible for the deaths of her mother and other relatives. The treatment was developed just 12 years after researchers in Cambridge first identified the faulty gene responsible for the disease, partly through studying the patient's own family, offering new hope for a normal life.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled through the arm by a beach umbrella pole in a freak accident. The incident occurred when a gust of wind caught the umbrella she was trying to secure, pulling her off the lifeguard stand and onto the pole. Remarkably, she remained calm throughout the ordeal as first responders used a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport, and the pole narrowly missed major arteries, nerves, and tendons.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured images of what is believed to be a newly discovered exoplanet, marking a significant first for the observatory. The celestial body, named TWA 7b, is estimated to have a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young star. Scientists used high-contrast imaging with a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and detect the faint planet, with evidence strongly suggesting it is a planetary body and not a background galaxy.</p>

The provision would have allowed the U.S. to tax companies and investors from countries deemed to have unfair foreign tax policies, a measure critics warned would deter foreign investment. The removal follows an agreement among G7 countries on a global tax deal, though it complicates Republican efforts to find offsets for the bill's costs. (not investment advice)</p>
