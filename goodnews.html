          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from New York City and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Harlem native, served in the House of Representatives for 46 years, earning a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for his service in the Korean War. He was also the first Black chair of the House's influential Ways and Means Committee and was instrumental in the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation. However, Rangel's career was also marked by ethics violations, leading to a censure by the House in 2010, though he was reelected to two more terms. The passing of Rangel marks the end of an era for Harlem's political leadership and a significant loss for the community he served for decades.</p>

Magyar's 11-day, 300-kilometer walk aimed to address the concerns of Hungarians and signal the beginning of the end of the Orban era. Recent polls suggest Magyar and his Tisza Party could defeat Orban's Fidesz in the next election, due in 2026, as he campaigns against corruption and infrastructure issues. Magyar is also capitalizing on Orban's mistake of backing a pro-Russian candidate in Romania's presidential election, which has put Orban at odds with the political party of Romania's Hungarian minority.</p>
