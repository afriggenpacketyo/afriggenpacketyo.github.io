          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen experienced a concerning moment during the first quarter against the New York Jets, appearing to hit his head on a player's knee during a run. After leaving the field with a profusely bleeding nose, he was briefly replaced by backup Mitchell Trubisky. Allen returned at the start of the second quarter and successfully led his team to a decisive 30-10 victory. Despite the injury scare, he finished the game with 148 passing yards and 59 rushing yards, helping the Bills advance to a 2-0 season start.</p>
