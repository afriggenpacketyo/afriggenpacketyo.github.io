        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the rising cost of driving lessons in the UK and the struggles faced by learners, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. Many learners are finding it difficult to afford lessons, leading them to cut back on other essential expenses or take fewer lessons, prolonging the learning process. Driving instructors justify the price increases due to rising expenses such as fuel, insurance, and car maintenance. The backlog for practical driving tests also forces learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, further exacerbating the financial burden.</p>

          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in for his second term as President of Ecuador, vowing to continue his fight against drug trafficking, corruption, and violent crime. The 37-year-old president also pledged to implement reforms and work with the private sector to create jobs and investment. Noboa's re-election comes amid ongoing challenges of violence and high unemployment in Ecuador, and he will need to maintain a majority in Congress to push through his agenda, including a crime-fighting bill. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of violence by rebuilding Ecuador's social fabric and providing opportunities for young people.</p>

          <p>The article discusses potential new rules in England that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers. The government plans to require housebuilders to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports. Those who repeatedly fail to meet targets could face penalties, including losing their land and being denied future permissions. The aim is to address the housing crisis by accelerating the construction of new homes, though critics worry that adding burdens on builders could hinder progress.</p>

          <p>During the Cold War, the U.S. Army explored the concept of heavily armored helicopters, essentially flying armored fighting vehicles. Sikorsky developed dual-hardness steel armor and the Advancing Blade Concept (ABC) to create more survivable rotorcraft. The Aerial Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (AARV) and the Aerial Armored Personnel Carrier (AAPC) were two projects that resulted from this, but neither progressed beyond the prototype stage. While these specific designs never materialized, the Advancing Blade Concept made a comeback in later designs, influencing projects like the X2 demonstrator and the S-97 Raider.</p>
