          <p>A study by Inspired Taste has revealed America's favorite pasta shapes, highlighting regional preferences and nationwide outliers. Spaghetti leads nationally, favored in 20 states, particularly Mississippi, while penne is preferred in the Pacific Northwest. The study found that elbows are the least popular, not being the favorite in any state, while Arizona stands out as the biggest penne lover. These findings illustrate the diverse culinary landscape of the United States and how deeply people feel about their pasta choices. This study is more of a lighthearted cultural survey.</p>

The West Indies struggled without star all-rounder Hayley Matthews, and England's bowlers, particularly Sarah Glenn, capitalized on the conditions.

Reform leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will take on a more public role and appear more frequently in the media.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians are turning to remembrance politics, with three initiatives aimed at recognizing and healing historical injustices. The parliament voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, recognize returnees from Indochina, and address Haiti's "double debt." These symbolic gestures come as the government struggles to address structural reforms due to a lack of an absolute majority in the legislature. While some view these initiatives as social maturity, others see them as easier to pass than substantive policy changes.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of rape and murder, has been re-captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who was serving a 30-year prison term for murder and a 50-year term for sexual assault, escaped on May 25. He was apprehended approximately 1.5 miles from the prison after tracking dogs picked up his scent. His capture brings relief to the community, and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement for their efforts.</p>
