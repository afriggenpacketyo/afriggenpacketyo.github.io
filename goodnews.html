          <p>Representatives Titus and Omar have introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025, seeking to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill aims to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that hinder federal funding for Schedule I substance research. Proponents argue that this legislation would enable policymakers to craft effective, evidence-based cannabis policies, addressing questions about medical use, dosage, and long-term impacts, while also allowing for research into other Schedule I substances like psilocybin and MDMA for therapeutic applications.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the goal of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space, splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft, which failed its original mission due to a rocket booster malfunction, serves as a reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration efforts. While the U.S. focused on the moon, the Soviet Union pursued Venus through the Venera program, achieving milestones like the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and land on its surface, highlighting a time of innovation and competition in space.</p>

The discovery was made possible through a third-party forensic tester and a federal grant. Medin's disappearance had been classified as a cold case homicide, and while no suspects have been identified, the new evidence provides law enforcement with another clue. The use of advanced DNA sequencing has helped bring closure to the community and the victim's family.</p>
