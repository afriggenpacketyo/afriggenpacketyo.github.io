        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its nationwide policy that required travelers to remove their shoes during airport security screenings. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change, citing advancements in screening technology and layered security measures like REAL ID as reasons for the update. The shoe-removal rule was implemented in 2006 following the failed attempt by Richard Reid to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoe in 2001. While the new policy is effective immediately, officials noted that some passengers may still be asked to remove their shoes for additional screening on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the creation of a transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific port of Chancay. The proposed 4,500-kilometer railway could significantly alter South American trade routes to Asia, potentially reducing shipping times by up to 12 days compared to the Panama Canal route. The agreement, signed between Brazil's state-owned Infra S.A. and the China Railway Economic and Planning Research Institute, initiates technical, environmental, and economic studies for the massive project. The studies are expected to take up to five years to complete.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares of Amazon stock, valued at approximately $665.8 million, over two days in July. This transaction is part of a previously announced plan to sell up to 25 million shares of the company through May 2026. Bezos, who continues to serve as Amazon's chairman after stepping down as CEO in 2021, remains the company's largest shareholder with over 900 million shares. The sale follows his recent high-profile wedding in Venice and is consistent with his ongoing strategy of liquidating portions of his holdings.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured a place in the Club World Cup final by defeating Brazilian side Fluminense, driven by two powerful goals from their new forward, João Pedro. The former Fluminense player scored in both halves, first with a swerving shot from the edge of the box and later with a rising drive off the crossbar. The match was played in intense heat in New Jersey, but Chelsea's pace and clinical finishing proved too much for their opponents. Chelsea will now face either Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid in the final, with a chance to become world champions.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. heavy cruiser, resting on the seafloor of the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made by the Ocean Exploration Trust, whose scientists used distinctive details to positively identify the wreckage.</p>

          <p>An Iranian woman, Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years without legal status, has been released from ICE detention following a significant community and political effort. Kashanian was abruptly detained outside her New Orleans home shortly after U.S. airstrikes on Iran. A letter-writing campaign from neighbors and friends detailing her community service brought her case to the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened with the Trump administration. After decades of regular check-ins with immigration authorities, her sudden detention had sparked fear and outrage among her supporters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for late July, financial experts are advising savers to act strategically to capitalize on currently high interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs). The guidance suggests that savers should shop online for the best rates, which often surpass those at brick-and-mortar banks, and lock them in before a potential rate cut is announced. It is also crucial for individuals to carefully calculate how much money they can afford to deposit for a specific term to avoid costly early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mixed 'Superman' Review Praises Film's Energy But Criticizes Lack of Sincerity</h2>

          <p>The new "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, presents a rebooted hero who is impulsive and somewhat naive, a concept with potential for the modern era. The review finds the movie entertaining and energetic, with strong performances from Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. However, it criticizes the film's struggle with sincerity, suggesting David Corenswet's Superman comes off as more dazed than idealistic. While the plot is impatient and filled with side characters, the overall tone is seen as an entertaining but sometimes awkward mix of silliness and seriousness.</p>
