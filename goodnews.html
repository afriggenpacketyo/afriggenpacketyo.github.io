          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), declaring the actions unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and criticizes the administration's takeover and termination of staff. Judge Howell stated that the administration's actions, including the use of force to seize USIP headquarters, were unconstitutional because the agency is not part of the executive branch. The USIP supports both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine will begin ceasefire negotiations immediately following a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump described the tone of the conversation as "excellent" and indicated that Pope Leo XIV has expressed interest in hosting the negotiations. However, Putin has not publicly indicated a desire for a ceasefire, and the White House has not released details of Trump's subsequent conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article notes that Trump believes Russia wants to engage in large-scale trade with the U.S. once the conflict ends.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how tax relief programs offered by the IRS can assist taxpayers struggling with past-due debt by reducing the total amount owed, pausing collection efforts, or making payments more manageable. Programs like Offers in Compromise, installment agreements, and penalty abatement are highlighted, but the article emphasizes that eligibility depends on financial circumstances and compliance with future tax obligations. While these programs can provide relief, they don't always eliminate the debt entirely, and taxpayers should be wary of scams and understand the potential consequences like liens or wage garnishments.

          <p>Wynn Resorts has dropped its bid for a casino license in New York City, citing better uses for its capital and persistent opposition. The company, which partnered with Related Companies for a Hudson Yards development, joins Las Vegas Sands in abandoning efforts to secure a gaming license in the state. Casino executives have privately complained about the politicized and expensive process, with MGM Resorts and Resorts World considered frontrunners. Wynn plans to allocate its capital to stock buybacks and existing developments, including a casino resort in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

          <p>Stocks recovered strongly on Monday after initial selling pressure driven by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Capital One's shares rose after settling litigation involving its savings accounts for $425 million and completing its $35 billion acquisition of Discover Financial. JPMorgan Chase's comments about expected declines in investment banking fees caused a sell-off in bank stocks, though those losses were later pared.
