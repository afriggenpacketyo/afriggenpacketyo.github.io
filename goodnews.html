          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a noteworthy performance in his NFL preseason debut, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns, leading three scoring drives against the Carolina Panthers. Despite being a fifth-round draft pick and fourth on the depth chart, injuries provided him the opportunity to start, where he demonstrated significant poise. Coach Kevin Stefanski acknowledged the strong performance but remained noncommittal about changes to the quarterback depth chart.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress on the Canyon fire near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line, achieving 28% containment and allowing thousands of evacuated residents to return home. The wildfire, which started during a heat wave, has burned 5,370 acres, destroyed at least two structures, and injured three firefighters. While evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings, public health officials have issued a smoke advisory for the area through the weekend due to unhealthy air quality. Crews are continuing to reinforce containment lines amid challenging, hot weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a pivotal "gear shift" in his life. The discovery, made during a genetic test for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the news prompted a deeper reflection on his life's purpose and motivations beyond personal collection. This change in mindset influenced the second season of his show, focusing more on personal, experiential learning about health and well-being.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend known as "treatonomics" is seeing a boom as people spend on both small indulgences and large-scale experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This behavior expands on the classic "lipstick effect," where consumers buy modest items when under financial pressure. Now, people are also prioritizing significant, memorable events like concerts, even while cutting back on daily expenses. Economists suggest this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional life milestones, leading people to seek joy in more immediate, accessible ways.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in a chapel within the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, Spain, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. The city's mayor praised the rapid intervention, stating it "averted a catastrophe." The blaze, which may have been caused by a short circuit in an electric sweeper, prompted an immediate response from three fire teams who controlled and put out the flames. The building, originally a mosque from the 8th century and converted to a cathedral in the 13th, is a celebrated jewel of Islamic architecture and a major tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the retail giant overcharged customers in California for certain products. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorney offices, claimed that Walmart sold items, particularly prepared foods and produce, that weighed less than their labels indicated, violating state laws against false advertising. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures ensuring employees accurately weigh and price products in its California stores.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled a lawsuit filed after she was fired from the show "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. While settlement details remain private, a Lucasfilm statement praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues that her firing was an overreaction and that the settlement was the right course of action, separate from broader concerns about "cancel culture." The case highlights the complex relationship between entertainers, their public political speech, and the corporations they represent in a social media-driven world.</p>

During their 148-day mission, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments and were replaced by the newly arrived Crew-11.

          <p>Despite their vastly different political ideologies, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy have formed a strong personal friendship. Vance, a conservative Republican, is currently on a holiday trip in the UK, which began with a family stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences of challenging upbringings, their Christian faith, and their time at prestigious U.S. universities. This personal relationship is seen as a potentially valuable diplomatic channel, particularly given the personalized nature of the current U.S. administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>An investigation has found no evidence to support a viral social media claim that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times. The claim, which originated from a Facebook user purporting to be a retired pilot, is discredited by several facts. Notably, Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making landings by a plane like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. The user's credentials were also questionable, as the photo shared appeared to feature a costume pilot pin from an online retailer.</p>
