          <p>Charles Michel, former president of the European Council, emphasized the importance of responsible competition and stability in the EU-China relationship, advocating for it to remain independent of other global powers' influence. He highlighted that managing differences with sincerity is essential, given the differing traditions, cultures, and political systems. These comments come as Europe and China ease restrictions on reciprocal exchanges, marking 50 years of diplomatic relations. President Xi Jinping has also called for a stable relationship beneficial to both sides and the world.</p>

          <p>Maintaining friendships can be challenging after having children, with parents and non-parents often making assumptions about each other's availability and interests. Communication and compassion are key to keeping these relationships strong, with both sides needing to express their needs and be flexible. Including friends in both family-focused events and child-free activities can help maintain connections and create balance. Openly addressing feelings of exclusion or lack of support can strengthen relationships and allow for understanding as friendships evolve.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). After medications proved insufficient, Laycock underwent DBS, which involves an implanted device delivering electrical currents to the brain. He later transitioned to adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), which fine-tunes the stimulation in real-time to better control symptoms. Laycock's tremors are now minimal, and his dyskinesia is well-managed, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have developed a close bond built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to defending Ukraine's sovereignty against Russian encroachment. The two leaders communicate frequently, bypassing formal diplomatic channels to discuss critical issues and offer support, with Macron viewing Zelensky as a courageous leader embodying Ukrainian resistance. Their relationship evolved significantly after Macron's visit to Kyiv, leading to increased French support for Ukraine and a shift in Macron's stance towards Russia. Macron has also played a crucial role in facilitating communication between Zelensky and other world leaders, including President Trump, and in introducing new strategies for addressing the war.</p>
