          <p>The Trump administration utilized its 'golden share' rights to block U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These special powers, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto authority over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, U.S. Steel reversed its decision and confirmed the facility would remain operational. This action marks the first use of these rights and underscores the administration's increasing influence in the private sector to protect American jobs.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after a highly unusual qualifying session that was interrupted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, was marked by numerous crashes, including one by championship contender Oscar Piastri in the final segment. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, having set a fast time early before the disruptions intensified. The chaotic conditions led to a shuffled grid, with notable drivers like Lewis Hamilton failing to advance to the top-10 shootout, setting the stage for an unpredictable race.</p>

          <p>Despite Warren Buffett's known skepticism of cryptocurrency, mutual fund manager Mark Casey of Capital Group is leading a significant investment into Bitcoin-related assets. Capital Group has invested approximately $1 billion in companies with substantial Bitcoin holdings, such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, believing the digital currency will eventually surpass gold as a primary store of value. Casey's strategy involves gaining exposure to Bitcoin through equity in these publicly traded companies, as direct holding is not possible for the mutual fund. This move highlights a growing divergence in investment philosophy, even among those who admire traditional value investors like Buffett. (not investment advice)</p>

He recovered items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards from the widespread debris left by the storm, preventing them from ending up in a landfill. With a background in home construction, Saunby is using the found treasures to realize a unique creative vision, incorporating natural elements like Black Locust bark siding. The project represents a story of resilience and resourcefulness in the face of natural disaster, turning destruction into a personal and creative opportunity.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries in her return from a concussion. Despite an early lead, England faced a resilient French side that kept the contest close, trailing by only two points at halftime. However, a stronger second-half performance, highlighted by tries from Amy Cokayne and Abbie Ward, allowed England to pull away and set up a final showdown against Canada.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old from Atlanta, moved to the Chiba Prefecture in Japan to teach English, seeking a change from the U.S. school system and a more affordable lifestyle. Her employer secured her a one-bedroom apartment for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 per month, within walking distance of her job. Living in the countryside offers a cheaper and more respectful culture compared to Tokyo, with total monthly expenses around $376. Smith is documenting her experience on social media to showcase a more authentic, non-urban perspective of life in Japan for others considering a similar move.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 10:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several appliance manufacturers, including Haier, Hisense, and Xiaomi, have introduced a new washing machine design featuring three separate drums. This innovation allows users to run multiple laundry cycles simultaneously with different settings, addressing the common problem of spending an entire day on laundry. The design typically includes one large central drum for main loads and two smaller drums above it for delicates, baby clothes, or undergarments. While these machines promise greater efficiency and convenience, they are not yet widely available, and potential buyers may need to consider factors like drum size and brand availability.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes achieved multiple all-time highs this week after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut since last December.

This decision spurred investor optimism, leading to weekly gains of approximately 1.2% for the S&P 500 and 2.2% for the Nasdaq.

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the center of a 1998 political scandal to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that after years of trying to live anonymously, she decided to embrace her story to help others who have experienced public shaming, particularly in the digital age. Lewinsky noted the cultural shift brought by younger generations and the #MeToo movement, which provided new language and empathy for understanding abuses of power. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, healing from trauma, and finding the resilience to insist on a different ending.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, driven by the rising cost of U.S. higher education and domestic political turmoil. Data shows a significant increase in U.S. students studying abroad over the last five years, with consultants reporting a massive spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the lower tuition fees overseas present a compelling alternative to accumulating substantial student debt in the U.S. Students are also motivated by a desire for different cultural experiences and concerns about the political climate at home.</p>
