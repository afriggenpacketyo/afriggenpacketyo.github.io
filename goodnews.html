        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has invalidated President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. The judge criticized the order, which targeted the firm for its association with Robert Mueller, as an assault on the independence of the judiciary and the legal profession. The order sought to suspend security clearances, terminate government contracts, and impose a hiring freeze on the firm. WilmerHale sued in late March, asserting that the order was an unprecedented attack on the judicial system's foundations; the court agreed and permanently blocked the executive order.

District Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, stated that the order violated the cornerstone of the American system of justice. The executive order was issued against WilmerHale because the firm had previously employed former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.
