          <p>Chinese exporters are utilizing a trade fair in Nanning as a strategic entry point to expand into Southeast Asian markets, shifting focus away from slowing demand in Europe and the United States. Many firms, like electric scooter manufacturer Li Wenqi's, see the region's rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base as a significant opportunity for growth. Facing market saturation in the West and geopolitical instability elsewhere, these companies view Southeast Asia as a crucial new frontier for their products. The annual event provides a valuable platform for Chinese businesses to connect with regional buyers and establish a stronger international presence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing improper and politically charged language in the complaint. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and functioned more as a political rally speech than a serious legal document. The judge did not rule on the lawsuit's merits but has given Trump's legal team 28 days to refile an amended, more professional complaint that adheres to procedural rules. The New York Times welcomed the ruling, stating it recognized the original filing as a political tool rather than a legitimate legal claim.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St James's Park in London. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed his desire to capture the late monarch's "grandeur and dignity." The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will also honor Prince Philip, is set to be revealed in 2026. Jennings stated he will consult with the Royal Family and consider public sentiment to create a fitting tribute to Britain's longest-reigning monarch.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the UK, major American tech companies like Nvidia and Microsoft announced significant investments, signaling a strong belief in Britain's potential as an AI superpower. Microsoft revealed a £22 billion investment to expand its AI infrastructure in the country, while Google is also investing heavily in data centers. This influx of capital from Silicon Valley giants is seen as a potential catalyst for the UK economy, particularly in the tech-focused "Golden Triangle" of Oxford, Cambridge, and London. However, some critics, like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, warn that Britain risks becoming overly dependent on US technology.</p>

As a film continuation of the popular series prepares for release on Netflix, Murphy emphasized the joy of growing older with a character in long-form television. While promoting his new film "Steve," he confirmed the Peaky Blinders movie script is complete but kept plot details confidential to maintain the surprise for fans. He credits the show's massive success to its writing and its emergence at a specific cultural moment.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 participants of the "We Are America" march have completed their 14-day, 160-mile journey from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., to advocate for democratic principles. The diverse group of marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, aimed to build a movement to hold leaders accountable in response to actions by the Trump administration. Upon their arrival in the capital, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, including Rep. Al Green and Sen. Chris Van Hollen. The marchers carried a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children, which they presented to Senator Van Hollen as a symbol of their mission.</p>

          <p>The comedy show "Pupusas and Punchlines," held in a Los Angeles Salvadoran restaurant, is providing a vital platform for Latinx comedians in a competitive stand-up scene. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the event allows performers to connect with an audience over shared cultural experiences, from immigration to family dynamics, in a space where they can enjoy traditional food. The show has grown from a monthly event to a sold-out weekly fixture, highlighting both established and up-and-coming comics from underrepresented groups. Performers note the uniquely supportive atmosphere, which allows for a deeper connection with the local community than typical Hollywood comedy clubs.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to monitor key economic data and corporate earnings reports in the upcoming week. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a crucial inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, is scheduled for release on Friday. Major earnings reports are also expected from companies including Micron, Costco, and AutoZone, which could influence market direction. Cramer suggested that while some investors remain skeptical, many sectors may continue their upward trend, and that further details from President Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping could also move stocks.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding the future of TikTok in the United States, although a final agreement has not yet been reached. Following a phone call between the two leaders, a White House official confirmed that negotiations are moving forward. President Trump later stated that a deal is "well on its way" and could be a formality. This development comes after months of uncertainty, during which the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, faced a federal law requiring it to divest its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban.</p>

          <h2>UK's Liberal Democrats Propose Opening Police Desks in Supermarkets and Libraries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new community policing initiative that would require every police force in England and Wales to open counters in public venues like supermarkets, libraries, and shopping centers. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, boost public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. To fund the "police desk promise," the Liberal Democrats suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, which they claim would free up sufficient resources. The policy was announced at the start of the party's annual conference as it seeks to appeal to voters concerned about community safety.</p>
