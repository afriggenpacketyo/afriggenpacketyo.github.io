          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in the opening game of the NCAA super regionals, bringing them one step closer to the College World Series. Despite an early home run by UTSA, UCLA responded with consistent hitting and strong defensive plays, including a standout performance by pitcher Michael Barnett. Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning provided a crucial cushion, and freshman Easton Hawk closed out the game to earn the save. The Bruins' ability to capitalize on hits and walks, coupled with solid defense, propelled them to victory in this tightly contested match.</p>

          <p>Japanese telecom giant NTT Docomo will discontinue its original emoji set, which played a significant role in shaping digital communication. The decision comes as Google's emoji have become more prevalent globally, and new Android smartphones and feature phones from Docomo will now adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji. Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji gained popularity in Japan and were later added to the Museum of Modern Art's collection in 2016.

          <p>European startup founders and venture capitalists are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's intense '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some argue that such a culture is necessary to compete globally, many in Europe believe it leads to burnout, decreased retention, and conflicts with European values and regulations. Instead, they advocate for more funding, resources, and sustainable innovation cultures to foster long-term success. This debate underscores the differing approaches to work-life balance and business growth in Europe compared to the US and China.</p>
