Bank of America reported outflows from U.S. equities and inflows into European stocks, while private equity firms see greater returns in Europe relative to the risk in the U.S. Concerns about EU-U.S. trade tensions persist, but optimism remains about finding a mutually beneficial solution.

          <p>UAE oil giant ADNOC is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a potential takeover of the energy major. BP has faced underperformance relative to industry peers, making it an attractive target. ADNOC's interest is seen as a significant development given its growing, cash-rich business and existing relationship with BP. BP is seeking to restore investor confidence through a strategic reset, which includes increasing oil and gas spending while reducing renewables investment. The company aims to fend off a potential takeover by improving its financial performance.</p>

The RBI's move is part of a comprehensive review of the legal framework governing the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).

China has invested billions to fill these gaps, but faces challenges in catching up to global leaders like Nvidia and TSMC. Huawei's HiSilicon is making progress with its Ascend chips, but limitations in manufacturing equipment and memory components remain.
