        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that a recession is still a serious possibility for the U.S., even after recent tariff rollbacks on China. While he acknowledges the tariff pauses are a positive sign, he emphasized that import taxes remain significantly higher than the previous year, potentially hindering investment. Dimon deferred to his bank's economists, who estimate recession odds at just below 50%, a slight improvement from last month's forecast. He stressed the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the need for continued dialogue to mitigate economic damage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 10:59:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article examines how the 'reverse logistics' industry, which recirculates overstocked and returned goods, may benefit from the tariff war with China. As retailers reduce orders due to tariffs, companies like ReturnPro, which sort, clean, and repackage returned items, are expected to see increased demand. ReturnPro handles a wide array of goods returned to retailers, potentially generating significant revenue for retailers compared to liquidating or sending them to landfills. With fewer new goods coming in, retailers may rely more on refurbished products to meet consumer demand.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to economic changes and policy uncertainties. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon. Powell cautioned that more frequent and persistent supply shocks could create difficult challenges for the economy and central banks. While he didn't mention President Trump's tariffs directly, he has previously suggested they could slow growth and increase inflation.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' after experiencing higher-than-expected growth in the first quarter of the year. The 0.7% growth rate was driven by increased consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts cautioned that this growth may slow due to the impact of US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite the positive figures, Reeves acknowledged that the cost of living crisis remains a reality for many families.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers at 75 U.S. stores initiated a strike in response to the chain's new dress code, impacting over 1,000 employees. The union, Starbucks Workers United, argues that the new policy, requiring solid black shirts and specific bottoms, should be subject to collective bargaining. Workers criticized the company for prioritizing dress code over more pressing issues, like understaffing and long wait times. Starbucks maintains that the strike has limited impact, with over 99% of stores remaining open.</p>
