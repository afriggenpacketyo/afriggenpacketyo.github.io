          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci and Saint Laurent, experienced a significant increase following reports that Renault's Luca de Meo is set to become the group's CEO. De Meo's potential appointment is seen as a strategic move to revitalize Kering's struggling brands, particularly Gucci, which has faced declining sales. Analysts believe de Meo's expertise in brand management and marketing, demonstrated during his successful turnaround of Renault, could be beneficial in the luxury sector. However, the challenges in rejuvenating luxury brands are substantial, requiring significant investment and a shift in consumer preferences, making this a complex endeavor for the incoming CEO.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning its policies with those of the United States amid increasing tensions with Beijing. This action restricts Taiwanese firms from shipping products to these companies without prior regulatory approval, as Huawei and SMIC are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List". Both Huawei and SMIC are also on a U.S. trade blacklist and have been affected by Washington's sweeping controls on advanced chips. Analysts suggest this move aims to reinforce existing policies and tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches, thus indicating a stricter stance on technology exports to these Chinese entities.</p>

While Europe seeks to diversify its supply chains and access new markets, experts doubt it can overtake the established influence of the U.S. or China in the region. Southeast Asia's relationships are primarily built on economic ties, and without increased trade opportunities, Europe may struggle to compete with the bloc's existing trading partners, as China remains Southeast Asia's largest trading partner.</p>
