          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., sided with Learning Resources, Inc., a Chicago-area toy company, by blocking five executive orders signed by President Trump that imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. Judge Rudolph Contreras determined that the International Economic Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize Trump to impose these tariffs. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, which is stayed for 14 days pending a potential appeal by the administration. The ruling comes after the U.S. Court of International Trade also found the administration overstepped its authority over tariffs under IEEPA, asserting that Congress has the exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.</p>

          <p>Boeing plans to resume airplane deliveries to China next month after a pause due to trade tensions, according to CEO Kelly Ortberg. China has indicated they will accept deliveries, with the first shipments scheduled for June, signaling a positive shift in trade relations. Boeing, a major U.S. exporter, has been subject to tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, which are manufactured in South Carolina. Ortberg noted that much of these tariffs can be recouped when the planes are exported again, mitigating the financial impact.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer is contemplating reinvesting in Salesforce after a stock sell-off, despite strong earnings and guidance, driven by concerns that CEO Marc Benioff is running out of innovative ideas. RBC Capital analysts downgraded Salesforce due to concerns about the company reverting to acquisitions over organic innovation, particularly with the proposed $8 billion acquisition of Informatica. Benioff defends his strategy, emphasizing the company's pivot to Agentforce, its AI agent solution, which now generates over $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Wall Street is divided, with some analysts like Goldman Sachs supporting Salesforce's AI ambitions, while others remain skeptical of Benioff's acquisition-focused approach.

          <p>Harvard University has secured a temporary victory in its legal battle against the Trump administration's attempts to restrict foreign students, after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeared to partially reverse its initial decertification. DHS will now grant Harvard 30 days to demonstrate compliance with the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP), which authorizes universities to host academics on visas. Judge Allison Burroughs indicated she would issue a longer-term hold, allowing international students and faculty to continue studying at Harvard during ongoing litigation. The lawsuit raises questions about the government's power to dictate university curricula and enrollment policies, particularly concerning free speech rights.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on environmental impact studies for major projects, potentially expediting infrastructure development, with an 8-0 decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v.

This statement underscores the Fed's commitment to maintaining its independence amid Trump's public pressure to lower interest rates, which officials fear could destabilize the economy.</p>

While overall beer volume declined by roughly 1% in 2024, non-alcoholic beer volume grew by 9% globally, a trend driven by consumers reducing alcohol consumption. IWSR forecasts an 8% annual growth for no-alcohol beer through 2029, while ale volume is expected to decline by 2% annually.
