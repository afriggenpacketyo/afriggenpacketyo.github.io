          <h2>Novo Nordisk Shares Rise as Drugmaker Anticipates Wegovy Sales Recovery in 2025</h2>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a jump after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of the year, anticipating a decline in copycat compounded drugs. Despite reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales and a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast due to alternative versions impacting its U.S. market share, CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen anticipates a rebound following the FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling. The company's first-quarter net profit exceeded expectations, driven by an 83% increase in Wegovy sales, although overall revenue slightly missed forecasts. Novo Nordisk now forecasts sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, adjusting from the earlier 16% to 24% projection.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander is set to make her UK theatre debut in Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea' at London's Bridge Theatre, marking her return to the stage after 17 years. Vikander expresses her excitement and slight apprehension about returning to the stage as an adult, having grown up around theatre due to her mother's acting career. The play, adapted and directed by Simon Stone, will also star Andrew Lincoln and explores themes of choices, dreams, and the universal struggles women face. Vikander emphasizes the play's relevance to modern audiences, as it delves into timeless emotional and societal issues.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of expansive policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), to stimulate economic growth amid escalating trade concerns. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 10 basis points and reduce the RRR by 50 basis points, injecting substantial liquidity into the market. Additional measures include supporting financing for technology and real estate sectors, establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care, and lowering mortgage rates under the housing provident fund. While these measures aim to boost domestic credit demand, some analysts suggest their impact may be limited without further fiscal policy support.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have demonstrated resilience in the face of heightened tensions with Pakistan, with investors maintaining optimism about India's growth prospects. The market's positive reaction follows India's military operation targeting territory controlled by Pakistan. Analysts attribute this resilience to structural reforms, strong domestic demand, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals. Progress on trade talks with major partners, including a potential bilateral trade deal with the U.S., further bolsters market confidence. The article references historical precedents, such as the market's reaction to the Pulwama attack in 2019, to support the view that Indian assets will remain relatively stable despite geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), was elected chancellor of Germany in a second round of voting after failing to secure enough votes in the initial round. The first round's failure was unprecedented in Germany's postwar history and highlighted the fragility of the coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SDP. Merz secured 325 votes in the second round, surpassing the 316-vote threshold required in the 630-seat parliament.

The deal includes an extension of the exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years for people on short-term visas. Opposition parties argue this could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, especially with recent increases in UK employer Nics.

This approach has led to significant victories, a Spanish Cup win, and a narrow Champions League semifinal loss.
