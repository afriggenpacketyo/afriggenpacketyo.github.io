          <p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly responded to threats from the Trump administration to assume federal control over the city's police force. She defended the District's autonomy and countered White House claims of rampant violence by highlighting a 26% drop in violent crime compared to the previous year. While acknowledging a crime spike in 2023, Bowser asserted that current conditions do not legally permit a federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department. She stated the city needs more federal prosecutors and judges, not a show of force from the National Guard.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has remained noncommittal regarding the status of star pass rusher Micah Parsons, who recently requested a trade. The request came after a lack of progress in contract extension negotiations, with Parsons reportedly seeking a deal comparable to top NFL defenders. In a radio interview, Jones simply commented that he was glad to see Parsons is in shape, offering no further details on the negotiations. The four-time Pro Bowler has been a cornerstone of the Cowboys' defense, and his future with the team remains uncertain as the season approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's stock experienced a remarkable 13% weekly advance, its best in over five years, which market analyst Jim Cramer attributes to a significant short squeeze. Despite negative sentiment surrounding Apple's perceived lack of an AI strategy and potential regulatory headwinds, short-sellers who bet against the stock were forced to buy back shares as the price rose, fueling the rally. This surge has distorted the broader market averages, masking negative performance in many other stocks. The analysis suggests that Apple's fundamental challenges remain, but the technical market dynamics of the squeeze created an unexpected and powerful rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the men's Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave delivered a commanding performance to defeat the Birmingham Phoenix by nine wickets. The Brave's bowling attack, featuring Jofra Archer and Michael Bracewell, effectively dismantled the Phoenix batting lineup, restricting them to a low score of 106-7. In response, the Brave's batsmen chased down the target with ease, reaching the goal with 19 balls to spare, led by an unbeaten 48 from Leus du Plooy. The victory places the Southern Brave at the top of the league table alongside the Oval Invincibles.</p>

          <p>Enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is growing significantly in both political and financial circles, spurred by a more favorable stance from the Trump administration. President Trump recently signed the Genius Act, enabling major companies to issue their own digital currencies, and Congress is considering a regulatory framework for the industry. While proponents see a new era of financial innovation, critics, including a former SEC official, warn of high volatility and the potential for scams, drawing parallels to the subprime mortgage crisis. The shift in policy follows a massive lobbying effort and has coincided with a surge in the value of Bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, whom he portrayed in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," following Lovell's death at age 97. In a heartfelt social media post, Hanks described Lovell as a leader who dared to guide others to extraordinary places. He celebrated Lovell's pioneering voyages, which were driven by challenge rather than fame. Lovell famously commanded the near-disastrous Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which became known as a "successful failure" after the crew's safe return to Earth against all odds. Hanks concluded his tribute by wishing Lovell "God speed" on his next voyage.</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of "forest bathing," or shinrin-yoku, is gaining widespread popularity as a method for improving mental health and focus. The mindfulness practice involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses, which research shows can help lower stress levels. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks that encourage quiet reflection and disconnection from technology. Experts note that the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard, and the key is to be present and notice one's natural surroundings.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old man from Ohio, Jason Lee, and his family took a 13-month sabbatical in Taiwan after saving $60,000 over five years. The goal was to allow their young son to bond with his grandparents and for the couple to re-evaluate their career paths away from a demanding work culture. During the break, Jason focused on his health and realized that chasing higher salaries was not essential for his family's happiness. The transformative experience has led them to reconsider their professional priorities upon their return to the U.S., seeking more flexibility and personal fulfillment over high-pressure roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As generative AI provides sophisticated new tools for cyberattackers, corporations are fighting back by drafting AI agents into their own defense forces. These cybersecurity AI agents are being used to automate tasks like detection, analysis, and threat response, freeing up human professionals to focus on more strategic work. Experts believe this technology is essential to counter the rising scale and sophistication of AI-driven attacks, such as personalized phishing and malware creation. While still in early stages, the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity is seen as a critical step to manage workloads, address the talent shortage, and stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.
