        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a compelling men's final, world number one Jannik Sinner triumphed over two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to win his first Wimbledon title. The Italian player secured the victory in four sets, avenging a recent, grueling five-set loss to Alcaraz at the French Open. The match showcased the exceptional talent and athleticism of the two young stars who are increasingly dominating men's tennis. Sinner's composed and clinical performance on Centre Court ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak, solidifying his position at the top of the sport and earning him his first major title on a grass court.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, residents of Butler, Pennsylvania, are reflecting on how the violent event thrust their small town into the international spotlight. While saddened that their community is now associated with the attack, many express pride in how they unified to support the family of Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed. The article highlights the town's struggle to move past the tragedy, which has left a permanent mark on its identity as a wholesome, peaceful farm community. Residents describe themselves as "tough cookies" who came together in the face of horror, hoping that their unity will be remembered alongside the violence.</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver, Colorado, has been transformed into a unique public art gallery by its new owner, Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt undertook an eight-year renovation to create a free, privately funded space for the community. The gallery, named the Cookie Factory, aims to be a place for connection, contemplation, and healing through art, a mission personal to the founder. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based works by artist Sam Falls, with plans to rotate artists and maintain the space as a gift to the city for fostering important conversations.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles are turning to artificial intelligence dating assistants to improve their online dating experiences, with apps like Rizz and Keepler offering to craft witty replies and navigate difficult conversations. According to a recent study, nearly half of Gen Z now uses AI for dating help, a significant increase from the previous year. These tools can boost confidence for users who struggle with writing, but their rise also prompts questions about authenticity and the risk of misrepresentation. While some see AI as a helpful icebreaker, experts caution that it should be used to supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection.</p>
