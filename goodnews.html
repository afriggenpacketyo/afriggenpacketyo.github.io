          <p>Amid the devastating flash floods in central Texas that have claimed 68 lives, a U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer is being hailed as a hero for his life-saving actions. Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan, 26, is credited with rescuing 165 people, many of them children from the inundated Camp Mystic. This was reportedly the first rescue mission of his career, and he served as the sole triage coordinator at the scene, earning praise from officials for his selfless courage. His efforts represent a significant positive story of bravery and resilience during the ongoing tragedy.</p>

          <p>After making landfall in South Carolina, Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression but continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and into Virginia. The system brought heavy rainfall, with some areas expecting up to six inches, leading to numerous road closures and the collapse of a highway section in Chatham County, North Carolina. While no injuries were immediately reported, emergency crews were conducting rescues of stranded motorists. Forecasters also warned of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast for the next several days as the system moves northeast.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave for Miscarriages at Any Stage of Pregnancy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 03:05:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning a significant change to its Employment Rights Bill that will grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to paid bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, so the amendment aims to formally recognize the grief associated with loss at any stage. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve without having to rely on sick leave. Advocacy groups have praised the move as a major step forward in acknowledging the emotional impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The difference in taste between American and European chocolate stems from distinct production priorities and regulations. U.S. chocolate, like Hershey's, often includes butyric acid, a preservative that extends shelf life but imparts a slightly sour tang that can be unfamiliar to European palates. American recipes also tend to have a higher sugar content. In contrast, EU regulations mandate higher cocoa solid percentages and the use of cocoa butter as the main fat, while traditional processes like conching create a finer texture. These varying approaches reflect different consumer preferences and historical developments in the global chocolate industry.</p>

          <p>A specialized 14-member engineering team from the United Kingdom has arrived in Kerala, India, to repair a Royal Navy F-35B fighter jet that has been stranded for over three weeks. The advanced stealth aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Thiruvananthapuram airport on June 14 due to bad weather and subsequently reported a technical snag. After local engineers were unable to fix the issue, the specialist team was deployed with necessary equipment to assess and repair the $110 million jet. The prolonged stay of the state-of-the-art aircraft on Indian soil has generated significant public curiosity and media attention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has removed a ban on selling American jet engine components and technology to China, a move expected to significantly aid the production of China's homegrown C919 aircraft. The decision allows the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to import essential parts from a joint venture involving GE, securing the supply chain for its narrowbody jet. This access to critical engine technology is vital for Comac to fulfill hundreds of existing orders and pursue its ambitions of expanding into European markets. Analysts note, however, that previous U.S. restrictions may have strengthened Beijing's resolve to develop its own indigenous engine technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to visit China next week, where he will reportedly discuss the sensitive issue of the Darwin Port's ownership with President Xi Jinping. The port, strategically important for defense, is currently under a 99-year lease to a Chinese-owned company, a deal that has generated considerable controversy and security concerns in Australia. Albanese's agenda will include explaining Australia's position on foreign investment, particularly regarding the potential for a government-influenced sale of the port. The visit is seen as an effort to maintain positive diplomatic relations between the two countries while addressing a key point of contention.</p>

          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in all participants of a small clinical trial. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, correcting a mutation that prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. Researchers reported significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants, with children responding particularly well; one seven-year-old regained almost full hearing within months. This cutting-edge treatment, which was found to be safe, offers hope for treating other forms of genetic deafness in the future.</p>
