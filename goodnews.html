          <p>A 100-year-old great-grandmother from Virginia Beach, Ruth Lemay, has gained attention for her active lifestyle and advice on living a long life.

Lemay also emphasizes a diet rich in vegetables, lean proteins, and fruits, while avoiding alcohol and smoking. Despite her age, she lives independently and maintains a vibrant, energetic outlook on life.</p>

          <p>A year after significant electoral losses and leadership instability, the Scottish National Party (SNP) is demonstrating a political resurgence under leader John Swinney. Polling suggests the party has stabilized and could be heading towards a majority in the next Holyrood election, partly due to the fragmentation of support among rival parties like Labour and the Conservatives. This potential majority is central to the SNP's strategy for demanding another independence referendum, citing the precedent set in 2011. The party's resilience is bolstered by the nearly 50/50 split on the constitutional question within Scotland.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares its 15th five-year plan, the focus is shifting to its implications for industrial collaboration with Taiwan, particularly in high-tech sectors. A recent delegation of Taiwanese executives, including from major firms like Delta Electronics, visited a mainland Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer to explore potential partnerships. This highlights an evolution in the cross-strait economic relationship, where Taiwanese companies are increasingly becoming key suppliers of specialized components for leading mainland industries. The new plan is expected to further shape these evolving economic and industrial dynamics between the two.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has commented on the career of Marcus Rashford, stating that while the forward has "no limits" to his potential, he must consistently prove himself to avoid future regrets. Rashford, currently on a season-long loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, has shown promising form with three goals and five assists in ten games. Tuchel emphasized that talent alone is not enough at the elite level and that Rashford must regularly reach his personal best. The manager's comments serve as both a note of caution and encouragement for the 27-year-old player to maximize his career opportunities.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced its intention to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday shopping season, continuing a trend of large-scale temporary hiring to manage increased order volumes. The positions, which include both part-time and full-time roles, will offer an average pay of over $19 per hour. This move comes as the overall forecast for seasonal retail hiring is expected to be at its lowest since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm attributes the broader decline to factors like higher business costs and increased reliance on automation by other retailers.</p>

          <p>A significant US-brokered prisoner exchange has taken place, with Hamas returning all remaining living Israeli hostages and Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The event, a key first phase of a broader peace plan, was met with emotional celebrations on both sides. U.S. President Donald Trump, present in the region for the event, addressed Israel's parliament and attended a summit in Egypt, hailing a "historic dawn" for the Middle East. While this marks a crucial de-escalation after two years of war, significant challenges remain for the next phases of the peace plan.</p>

          <p>The recently brokered ceasefire in Gaza is being framed as a major diplomatic achievement for President Donald Trump, who celebrated the deal at a summit in Egypt with world leaders. This success builds on the Abraham Accords from his first term and halts a devastating two-year conflict, earning him widespread praise. However, this analysis piece notes that the most difficult phases of the peace plan, including Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's reconstruction, are yet to come. The long-term stability of the peace will depend on sustained diplomatic pressure and navigating the complex political dynamics within both Israel and Palestine.</p>

          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a restaurant in Baltimore, is bringing the unique flavors of Venezuelan cuisine to the local community through what its founder, Irena Stein, calls "culinary diplomacy." The key to its authentic taste lies in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are not commonly available in the U.S. and are now being grown locally by a Maryland farmer specifically for the restaurant. Chefs at the establishment note that the distinct aroma and fruitiness of these peppers are essential to their dishes. The restaurant aims to provide a cultural experience that seduces diners with a combination of flavors they have likely never encountered before.</p>

On Sunday, the president suggested on social media that a resolution was possible, easing investor fears of an escalating trade war. This shift in sentiment allowed markets to regain some stability ahead of the upcoming earnings season, which is expected to be the next major focus for investors. (not investment advice)</p>
