          <p>Twenty-four-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic secured his spot in the US Open last 16, overcoming Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match despite battling a lower back injury. Djokovic, seeking a record 25th major title, required medical attention early on but demonstrated his resilience and skill to win 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. Norrie, who has consistently fallen to the Serb, expressed a touch of overconfidence after an early break in the third set, which Djokovic quickly countered. For Norrie, this defeat still marks a positive trajectory in his career, having made significant progress after a challenging start to the year due to injury.</p>

          <p>All flights for SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional carrier in the U.S., experienced a temporary grounding for 21 minutes on Friday night at the airline's own request, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA issued a ground stop advisory at 0149 GMT, which was subsequently lifted at 0210 GMT, though the specific cause of the grounding was not immediately disclosed. SkyWest operates critical regional routes for major partners like United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines, meaning the brief disruption could have affected numerous travelers. While the incident was resolved quickly, the lack of immediate explanation left passengers and observers awaiting further information from the airline.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean—have established a new world record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, completing their arduous 9,000-mile journey in 140 days. Their expedition, undertaken in their boat 'Rose Emily,' named after their unborn sister, saw them endure violent tropical storms, forcing lengthy detours and even Lachlan being swept overboard at one point. The Scots have surpassed the previous record of 162 days, set by a Russian solo rower in 2014. Beyond their athletic feat, the brothers have raised over £700,000 towards a £1 million goal for clean water projects in Madagascar, combining personal achievement with significant humanitarian effort.</p>

          <p>A significant 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway, also known as Highway 2, has officially reopened to the public, coinciding with the Labor Day weekend, after enduring years of closure due to severe storm and fire damage. The road sustained considerable destruction from heavy rains in 2022 and 2023, which caused slope failures and pavement collapses, further exacerbated by the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, totaling approximately $7.9 million, involved installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and advanced drainage systems. This reopening restores crucial access to numerous popular hiking trails and is anticipated to reduce congestion at alternative trailheads, though visitors are cautioned about the current extreme fire danger level in the Angeles National Forest.</p>

          <p>Chinese equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, drawing attention from both retail and overseas investors, who are seeking better investment alternatives. Experts like Jian Shi Cortesi from GAM Investments anticipate a continued uptick, driven by domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's focus on technological innovation. With global markets near historical highs, Chinese equities are seen as having considerable room for growth, particularly in sectors like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics. This positive outlook suggests a potential reversal of previous underperformance, with foreign inflows increasing over recent months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans living and working in the U.S. The court upheld a lower court ruling, finding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior TPS extension, as the governing statute was designed to be 'predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics.' The DHS condemned the decision, vowing to use 'every legal option' to end what it calls an 'abused' program. This ruling offers a potential path for many Venezuelans to retain their legal status, though the fate of those whose protections already expired remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B testified in Los Angeles, denying she attacked a security guard who is suing her for assault, leading to viral moments from the civil trial. Cardi B stated the guard invaded her privacy by filming and revealing her pregnancy, escalating to a verbal altercation but not a physical one. The plaintiff claims Cardi B cut her cheek with a fingernail, causing a 'hyper-sensitive' scar. Cross-examination saw lawyers questioning Cardi B about her wigs and nails, drawing amusement and online debate about potential racist or misogynistic undertones. The trial, expected to conclude next week, highlights the public fascination with celebrity court proceedings.</p>

          <p>An innovative charity program in London and Manchester is pairing anxious teenagers with three-year-olds from local nurseries to improve school attendance and engagement. Teenagers like Siena, 13, who struggled with anxiety and school avoidance, have seen their attendance more than double, learning communication and confidence from their toddler mentees. The Power2 charity, which runs the 16-week scheme, believes giving disengaged teenagers responsibility for younger children in a controlled setting fosters accountability and positive role modeling. This initiative addresses the significant post-pandemic rise in school absence, with data showing a strong link between attendance and academic success.</p>

          <p>Nine-year-old Ethan Wargo from Sycamore, Illinois, has captured local hearts by establishing a 'free compliment stand' in his community.

Ethan, who occasionally needs to 'persevere' to find new compliments, has found the experience deeply 'heart-warming' as his simple act of kindness resonates profoundly with those who stop by.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Young Children with ADHD Often Receive Medication Too Soon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently prescribed medication too quickly. The research, which analyzed health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children, found that about 68% received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines recommend starting with 'behavioral intervention' for young children due to concerns about side effects like irritability and the high likelihood of treatment failure. Researchers emphasize the need for further investigation into the appropriateness of early medication, advocating for non-pharmacological strategies first.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly considering measures to expedite the reinstatement process for former service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, with a listening session scheduled for September 3. While hundreds have applied, less than two dozen have been reinstated since President Trump signed an executive order to reverse the Biden-era mandate. Defense officials are weighing granting honorable discharges to those whose departures were solely due to vaccine refusal, offering incentives like duty station preferences and back pay. This move aims to address frustrations among veterans and potentially bring back experienced personnel, reflecting a shift in policy and an effort to mend past divisions within the military.</p>

Her choice of wedding gown is expected to reflect her romantic and statement-making red-carpet style, possibly from an international designer. While some ponder a Kansas City wedding due to their shared history, the couple is expected to choose a private estate with personal significance, ensuring a unique and story-driven celebration.</p>
