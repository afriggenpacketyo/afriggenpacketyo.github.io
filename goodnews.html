          <h2>HBO Max to Rebrand Back to Original Name After Brief Stint as Max</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 10:51:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is reversing its decision to rename HBO Max to simply Max, opting to bring back the original HBO Max branding this summer. The company aims to refocus on high-quality programming rather than a broad range of content. CEO David Zaslav emphasized that HBO represents the highest quality in media, while JB Perrette highlighted the platform's distinct programming for adults and families. This move mirrors Disney's strategy of prioritizing quality content over quantity in the streaming market, as legacy media companies continue to navigate profitability challenges and increased competition from services like Netflix.</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court ruled that the European Commission failed to adequately explain its refusal to release text messages between Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO regarding COVID-19 vaccine negotiations. The New York Times had requested access to the messages under EU transparency laws, but the commission claimed it could not find them and argued they were "short-lived." The court found the commission's explanation insufficient, emphasizing the importance of transparency in matters of public interest.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and market volatility, experts suggest strategic approaches to gold investing, such as considering gold's price in context of its historical performance and understanding the different types of gold investments available. Wealth manager Joshua Barone notes that gold's recent performance is exceptional but supported by strong fundamentals like central bank purchases. Paul Williams recommends physical gold for long-term wealth storage, while John Berman suggests gold ETFs for liquidity. Experts also advise investors to be tax-aware, as physical gold is taxed at a higher rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, a move celebrated by many Syrians as a chance for economic recovery after years of civil war. The decision followed discussions with Saudi and Turkish leaders, with Trump citing the emergence of a new Syrian government. This policy shift aims to facilitate reconstruction and attract investment from neighboring countries. However, analysts caution that the unwinding of sanctions will be a gradual process, and challenges such as corruption and weak institutions remain significant hurdles to Syria's long-term economic revival.</p>

          <p>House Republicans advanced President Donald Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, after overnight debate in the Ways and Means Committee. The bill passed along party lines, but the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains a point of contention. The current proposal raises the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with incomes under $400,000, but some lawmakers seek a higher limit. The full House vote is expected soon, but significant changes are likely in the Senate, making the bill's future uncertain.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which manage the wealth of ultra-rich individuals, are struggling to find qualified money managers due to a combination of factors. While the number of family offices is expected to grow significantly, the industry faces a shortage of advisors, with McKinsey projecting a shortfall of roughly 100,000 advisors by 2034. Family offices also compete with banks and private equity firms for talent, and they often prioritize trust over other criteria. This selectivity and the perception of family offices as "risky" environments contribute to the talent crunch, prompting some to offer salary premiums and incentives.</p>

          <p>Andor, the Disney+ Star Wars spin-off series that concluded this week, traveled far, far away from the generally wholesome and fantastical adventures of the Jedi. The gritty story of Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna), a disillusioned smuggler turned Rebel Alliance operative, trained its attention on ordinary people trying to survive an oppressive system. Andor was the TV prequel to the film Rogue One, which was itself a prequel to the first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy; like its predecessor, Andor took its Star Wars storytelling seriously. The show held on to the franchise‚Äôs core idea that there exists in the universe a constant tension between good and evil. But it boldly interrogated the origins of that dichotomy, focusing on what pushes someone to adopt one set of beliefs over another.</p>
