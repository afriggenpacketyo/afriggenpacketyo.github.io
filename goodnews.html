          <p>Archaeologists believe they have discovered the wreckage of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857. The "significant discovery" was announced by the Australian National Maritime Museum and the SilentWorld Foundation after a four-year search. The article notes that the ship was carrying over 400 Chinese miners shortly before its sinking, connecting the find to stories of trade and migration. The wreckage includes the ship's windlass, and researchers found a magnetic anomaly matching the ship's length, confirming its identity.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, featuring an eight-tier hospitality section with Michelin-star menus, a rooftop pool, and views of the River Thames. The rooftop pool does not have a view of the pitch. The stand is designed more like a five-star hotel or cruise ship than a traditional football stadium, with a focus on the river view rather than the game itself. The stand will also operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays, targeting wealthy local residents.</p>
