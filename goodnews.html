          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, with which Bitcoin typically correlates. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt added to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A debate is growing within the Christian right about whether empathy is a sin, with some arguing that it's a tool used by progressives to manipulate Christians. This idea, initially articulated by pastor Joe Rigney, has gained traction among conservative figures and online reactionaries, influencing mainstream discourse. Critics argue this viewpoint often targets empathy for marginalized communities and liberal perspectives. Despite pushback from religious leaders, the conversation has entered mainstream media, sparking discussions about the role of empathy in society.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, a significant victory for Republicans, despite unanimous Democratic opposition and some Republican dissent. The bill, comprising tax cuts and adjustments to the social safety net, faces a complex path through the Senate. It will be considered under budget reconciliation rules, requiring only a simple majority for passage, instead of the typical 60 votes needed to advance bills in the upper chamber.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Donald Trump's tax package. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap. However, the House proposal for changes to the SALT deduction could still face pushback in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. There was also a large drop in the number of dependents accompanying people arriving in the UK on work and study visas, the ONS said.</p>
