          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a strong week, with the Nasdaq reaching a new record high, largely driven by Apple's performance. The tech giant's stock surged after it announced a $100 billion increase to its U.S. investment pledge, securing an exemption from new tariffs on semiconductor imports. The week's market movements were heavily influenced by tariff news, including a potential 25% increase on India's tariff rate. Despite positive earnings reports from many S&P 500 companies, some stocks like Eli Lilly faced significant losses due to specific company news. (not investment advice)</p>

The team, comprising astronauts from NASA, JAXA, and Roscosmos, conducted over 200 science experiments aimed at preparing for future human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. Their return marks the 12th successful crewed mission to the ISS by SpaceX under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers and halt anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, a key step by new President Lee Jae Myung's administration to de-escalate tensions. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which involved blasting K-pop and critical news from the South and unsettling noises from the North, had recently intensified. While this marks a potential thaw, relations remain tense as the U.S. and South Korea prepare for their annual joint military exercises later this month.</p>

          <p>Developers have completed a $104 million project to convert the abandoned 19th-century St. John's College campus in Brooklyn into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic site, which had been deteriorating for decades, now features 205 units, with 62 designated for affordable housing. The project preserved many original architectural elements, such as high ceilings and arched windows, while adding modern amenities like a gym and lounge. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which will receive income from the property while ensuring the landmark's preservation.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known '4% rule' for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, now advises that many retirees can safely spend more. In a new book, he suggests that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7% or even higher for current retirees. Bengen argues that many people are too conservative and don't spend enough in retirement, failing to enjoy their accumulated wealth. He emphasizes that inflation is the greatest enemy for retirees and recommends strategies like annual rebalancing to optimize portfolio longevity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major new exhibition is shedding light on the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her era, even more famous in her lifetime than Rembrandt or Vermeer. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch developed a unique perspective on life and decay, which she channeled into her meticulously detailed still-life paintings. The exhibition explores how she perfected the genre, creating complex compositions of flowers from different seasons and continents. Her work converted perishable, luxury commodities into stable, beautiful assets during the Dutch Golden Age.</p>

          <p>In a humorous turn of events during a scientific experiment, a robot crab named 'Wavy Dave' was destroyed by the very creatures it was designed to study. Researchers deployed the 3D-printed, remote-controlled robot in Portugal to observe the mating rituals of male fiddler crabs. Initially, the real crabs were wary, but after females seemed to reject the robot, some males confronted it. One aggressive male crab ultimately tore off the robot's waving claw, forcing the scientists to abandon the trial, but not before gathering valuable data on competitive signaling behavior in the species.</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be explained by simple probability and natural phenomena, not supernatural causes. He argues that given the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the area, the number of disappearances is not statistically unusual compared to other well-traveled parts of the ocean. This explanation aligns with the long-held positions of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and the insurance market Lloyd's of London. They attribute the incidents to factors like volatile weather from the Gulf Stream, complex navigation, and human error.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents' own phone habits are a key factor in their children's overuse of screens, which can hinder their development into successful adults. Speaking at a panel, Robbins shared her personal experience of realizing her children were mirroring her constant phone use. She advises parents to model 'phone-life balance' by creating physical distance from their devices and engaging with their kids about their online activities with curiosity rather than judgment. Psychologists note that excessive screen time can negatively impact sleep, mental health, and cognitive functions like attention and decision-making.</p>

          <p>According to a recent Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy in 2025, a decrease from last year's $2.5 million benchmark. However, this figure varies significantly by region, with residents in the West citing a need for $3 million, compared to $1.8 million in the South. Despite the lower national benchmark, nearly two-thirds of respondents feel that achieving wealth is harder due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The survey also found that the threshold for feeling 'financially comfortable' is much lower, averaging $839,000 nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a surprising rebirth by replacing defunct anchor stores with unconventional tenants, shifting from pure retail to community and entertainment hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people to the property weekly. Other malls are filling vacancies with tenants like The Cheesecake Factory, Dave & Buster's, and even expanding Barnes & Noble locations. This strategy of subdividing large spaces for a diverse mix of businesses is increasing foot traffic and creating new 'cross-shopping' opportunities, revitalizing these suburban staples.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teenager experienced debilitating symptoms for months, including severe headaches and memory loss. When physical therapy and medication failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed a rare and dangerous condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. The AVM was likely the true cause of his long-term symptoms. The teen underwent successful brain surgery to remove the malformation and is now recovering, raising awareness about the importance of advanced imaging for persistent post-concussion symptoms.</p>

By meticulously scrutinizing financial records and activity logs, she uncovered a pattern linking Ames's meetings with a Soviet official to large cash deposits. Her crucial work led to the 1994 arrest of Ames, who had compromised numerous operations and caused immense damage to national security.</p>
