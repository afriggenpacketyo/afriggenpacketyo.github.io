          <p>Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris has provided a positive update on his condition following a frightening injury during a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons. Norris was taken off the field by ambulance after convulsing on the ground following a tackle, leading to the game's suspension. He posted on social media that he is "all good," and a teammate later shared a photo of him smiling during a video call. The incident left players and coaches visibly shaken, but the updates have brought a sense of relief to the team and its fans.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers after its new president, Lee Jae Myung, halted anti-Pyongyang broadcasts to improve relations. For months, the two nations had engaged in a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign, with the North blasting disruptive sounds in response to the South's broadcasts of K-pop and critical messages. The move is seen as a small step toward easing tensions, though major joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises are scheduled to proceed.</p>

          <p>As a significant heatwave continues to affect Southern California, authorities have lifted the last evacuation orders for the Canyon fire, which has burned over 5,000 acres. The fire, which started in Ventura County and threatened areas near Castaic Lake, is now 28% contained with minimal overnight activity. The firefighting efforts were complicated by triple-digit temperatures across the region, which are expected to persist through the weekend. During the operations, a battalion chief from the Kern County Fire Department was seriously injured when his vehicle rolled over in the fire zone.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being 4.56 billion years old, making it older than our planet. A University of Georgia geologist analyzed fragments of the space rock, which was part of a fireball seen across the state in June. The scientist concluded that the meteorite originated from a large asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter that broke apart approximately 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite to be recovered in Georgia and the sixth witnessed fall in the state's history.</p>

De Gea, who left United two years ago after 545 appearances, was given a standing ovation by the crowd, providing a chance for the farewell he was not afforded at the time of his departure. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with United winning the subsequent penalty shootout. The event was an emotional one for the Spanish goalkeeper, who reflected on his time at the club and expressed hope for its future success.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been converted into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers spent $104 million to renovate the historic site of the former St. John's College, which had been deteriorating for decades. The project preserved original architectural details like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities and a new wing. The building, which includes 62 affordable housing units, has been embraced by the community for revitalizing the landmark property while honoring its historic character.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, specific foods can provide essential nutrients to support skin health and maintain a youthful appearance as one ages. Foods rich in vitamin C, such as sweet potatoes and tomatoes, help promote collagen synthesis, which is vital for skin elasticity. Salmon provides omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants that reduce inflammation and support the skin's moisture barrier. Other recommended foods include edamame for its isoflavones, kefir for its probiotics that improve hydration, and pumpkin seeds for their high zinc content, which aids in wound healing.</p>

          <h2>Creator of '4% Rule' Offers Updated Retirement Withdrawal Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 10:00:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has published fresh advice for today's retirees. In his new book, he argues that his original rule was a conservative, worst-case scenario. With a more diversified portfolio that includes small-cap and international stocks, he now suggests that many retirees can safely withdraw more, potentially around 5.25% to 5.5% annually. Bengen emphasizes that diversification, annual rebalancing, and a rising equity glide path can help retirees spend more without outliving their savings. (not investment advice)</p>
