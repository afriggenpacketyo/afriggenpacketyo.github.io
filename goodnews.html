          <p>A new analysis of government data by LendingTree reveals that Massachusetts residents lead the U.S. in per capita lottery spending, averaging $915 annually. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least at just $50 per year. The report highlights how lottery sales generate significant state revenue, accounting for as much as 3% of the general fund in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota. This data emerges as the national Powerball jackpot swelled to nearly $1.8 billion.</p>

          <p>Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has officially ruled out a presidential campaign in 2028, ending widespread speculation that he was a potential frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. During an appearance on "Meet the Press," Moore stated his intention to seek re-election as governor in 2026 and serve a full second term. Moore, a rising star in the party, has recently gained national prominence for his leadership following the Key Bridge collapse and for his pushback against President Trump's policies concerning Baltimore.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American pilot, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica. He was taken into custody for allegedly landing his plane illegally after providing a false flight plan during a solo journey to all seven continents aimed at raising money for cancer research. As part of his release, Guo has been ordered to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from entering Chilean territory for three years.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. However, the race was marked by a significant controversy within the McLaren team, which ordered Oscar Piastri to cede second place to his teammate Lando Norris. The order was issued after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a faulty wheel gun, had dropped him behind Piastri on the track. While Piastri complied, the decision has sparked debate about fairness in the increasingly tense championship battle.</p>

          <p>A new study by the financial services company River indicates that businesses have been purchasing an average of 1,755 Bitcoin per day over the past 20 months. This sustained institutional investment has reportedly contributed over $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin's market capitalization and has expanded corporate-held reserves to over 6% of the total circulating supply. Market analysts cited in the article suggest that if this trend continues, it could be a significant factor in pushing Bitcoin's price above the $125,000 mark. (not investment advice)</p>

For now, with income and wealth remaining high, the economy will likely adapt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major new study published in Nature Human Behavior, analyzing data from nearly 15 million people, has found a consistent, cross-cultural trend of individuals forming romantic partnerships with people who have similar psychiatric diagnoses. The research, which spanned generations from the 1930s to the 1990s in Denmark, Taiwan, and the U.S., identified these "spousal correlations" across nine disorders, including depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Researchers suggest this may be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the impacts of social stigma.</p>
