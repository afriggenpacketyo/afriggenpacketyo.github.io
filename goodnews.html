          <p>Chinese renewable energy company Envision Energy has launched the first phase of the world's largest green hydrogen and ammonia facility in Inner Mongolia. The plant is designed to produce 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually, with a goal of scaling up to 1.5 million tonnes by 2028. This development is a significant step in China's strategy to decarbonize its industrial sectors and establish a leading position in the global clean fuel market. Exports from the new facility are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>The UK government will not be making immediate changes to the rules for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), according to BBC reports. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was anticipated to announce a reduction in the £20,000 tax-free allowance to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. However, these plans have been put on hold for now, with the Treasury expected to continue consultations with the financial industry. The government's stated ambition remains to help savings deliver better returns and drive investment into the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The OPEC International Seminar, held at Vienna's Hofburg palace, brought together energy ministers, CEOs, and global oil industry leaders to discuss market stability, investment, and the green transition. The high-profile event, led by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, featured extensive security and a lavish setting. However, it was also met by protests outside the palace, with demonstrators calling for an oil embargo over the conflict in Gaza. The conference provided a rare opportunity for in-person dialogue as many OPEC+ meetings have shifted to virtual formats.</p>

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof on his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by the local council. His architects argued the current lead roof was "beyond repair" and vulnerable to theft, proposing a modern single-ply membrane as a replacement. However, Perth and Kinross Council ruled that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. McGregor purchased the 18th-century, ten-bedroom villa near his birthplace in 2023.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, even as the company faces declining sales across much of Europe. The success is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for space, all-wheel drive, and value. This trend persists despite a notable backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a rapid boom in the adoption of electric heavy trucks, with sales jumping 175% in the first half of the year. This surge, driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging network, is significantly curbing the nation's diesel consumption and denting overall oil demand. The trend has surprised analysts, causing them to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak. The lower operating costs of electric trucks are making them an increasingly attractive commercial option. (not investment advice)</p>
