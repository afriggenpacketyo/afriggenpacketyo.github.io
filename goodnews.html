          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 02:45:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the primary exporter of smartphones to the United States, accounting for 44% of U.S. imports in the second quarter. This significant shift, a 240% year-over-year increase in volume from India, is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While global manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola are also moving assembly to India, Apple's transition is the most aggressive. Despite the move, challenges such as lower manufacturing efficiency compared to China's mature infrastructure remain a consideration for companies.</p>

          <p>British banking giant Barclays exceeded profit expectations for the second quarter, reporting a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely fueled by a 10% year-over-year increase in its investment banking division's income, which benefited from market volatility. This result comes as CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan continues a strategic overhaul and cost-reduction plan initiated in February. The bank faces a competitive landscape, including potential challenges from new U.S. capital rules and strategic shifts among its U.K. rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian seam bowler Akash Deep has gained international recognition following a standout performance against England, but his path to success was marked by significant personal hardship. Growing up in the economically challenged state of Bihar, he temporarily abandoned cricket after the deaths of his father and elder brother within six months. He later moved to Bengal to pursue his dream, where his raw talent was eventually recognized, leading to an Indian Premier League spot and the national Test squad. Deep dedicated his recent performance to his sister, who is battling cancer, highlighting his resilience through family tragedy.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build "AI gigafactories" in an effort to close the gap with the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence sector. These facilities are envisioned as comprehensive ecosystems combining computing power, data, and researchers to industrialize the creation of AI models and applications. The EU has committed an initial 20 billion euros for these large-scale projects, which are expected to require billions more in private investment. While the plan aims to bolster Europe's technological sovereignty, it faces challenges including high energy costs and the need for significant grid modernization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their work of rescuing migrants in the English Channel, stating they make no apologies for saving lives at sea. The charity has faced criticism and accusations of operating a "taxi service" for people entering the UK illegally. However, volunteers emphasize their mission is purely humanitarian and apolitical, responding to any distress call from the Coastguard to help people in peril. The RNLI released harrowing images of a recent rescue to show the dangerous reality of their missions, where they saved 19 people from a capsized dinghy.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, encouraging deeper pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The call signals Beijing's effort to reset ties with Seoul's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is generally seen as more open to engagement with China than his predecessor. Both ministers affirmed a shared commitment to advancing their strategic partnership in a mature and steady manner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, the Chinese government has introduced its first nationwide subsidy for parents, offering 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three. The policy, which will be applied retroactively to the start of the year, aims to help approximately 20 million families with the high cost of raising children. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China faces a significant demographic crisis with a shrinking and rapidly aging population. Despite the abolition of the one-child policy, birth rates have remained low.</p>

          <p>The planned overseas trip for Taiwan's leader, Lai Ching-te, has been adjusted, with reports indicating a previously anticipated stopover in New York will not occur. According to the Financial Times, Washington informed Lai he could not stop in New York en route to South America. However, other reports suggest the trip was delayed, not canceled, and would still include stopovers in other U.S. cities. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited typhoon rehabilitation efforts and regional developments as reasons for the change, a decision that could potentially ease tensions with Beijing and smooth the path for a future meeting between the U.S. and Chinese presidents.</p>
