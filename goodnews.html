          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina made a swift decision to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022, committing funds after only a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was overlooked by many investors, but Reina was impressed by Staniszewski's deep technical understanding and his vision for solving fundamental problems within the nascent ecosystem, even without a fully developed product. ElevenLabs has since grown significantly, reaching a $3.3 billion valuation and planning a global expansion and IPO within five years.
