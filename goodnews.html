          <p>Berkshire Hathaway has completed the sale of its entire stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, a move confirmed by BYD executives as "normal" investment activity after 17 years. Despite a temporary dip in BYD shares, the company acknowledged Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's long-term support, noting their significant profits. Concurrently, Berkshire Hathaway is strategically expanding its investments in Japanese trading house stocks, with its stake in Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%, indicating a shift in portfolio focus. This divestment from BYD follows a period of cooling growth for the Chinese EV maker, including a cut in its 2025 sales target and its first quarterly profit decline in years.

Remembered for his courage, resilience, and perseverance against racism, he received numerous honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor and the Congressional Gold Medal.

European captain Luke Donald condemned the "personal insults" and "sounds" during backswings as crossing the line. Despite the challenging atmosphere, the European team, including McIlroy and Lowry, maintained composure and delivered a strong performance, showcasing remarkable resilience in a highly charged and difficult environment.</p>

This project aims not only to produce British rice but also to tackle climate change by re-wetting peat soils to lock in greenhouse gases, potentially cutting emissions. While commercial cultivation is risky now, research suggests rice could become a viable crop if temperatures continue to rise.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup player Keegan Bradley defended American fans as "passionate" despite widespread complaints from European players about hostile and abusive behavior during day two at Bethpage Black. Bradley controversially suggested that the Ryder Cup in Rome two years prior was also "pretty violent," contrasting with European captain Luke Donald's criticism of "personal insults" and disruptions during players' backswings as crossing the line. The article also notes a neck injury to European player Viktor Hovland, which forced him out of an afternoon session and raises concerns about his participation in Sunday's singles matches. This incident could potentially impact the final score, with a predetermined US player also being removed if Hovland cannot play.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David Ellison, are rapidly expanding their influence across the US media landscape, with deals involving major companies like TikTok and Paramount. Larry Ellison's fortune has surged to $370 billion, fueled by Oracle's AI infrastructure role, and his ties to President Trump have reportedly smoothed their path. David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control over CBS, and the family is reportedly eyeing Warner Brothers Discovery. This ascent, however, has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who warns of "dangerous concentration of power," and House Democrats investigating potential quid pro quo arrangements with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the use of shoe racks, leading to a prototype for a UVC light-equipped sterilizing rack. Their research, initially aimed at designing better hostel shoe racks, discovered that bacterial build-up caused the odor, prompting an investigation into UVC light as a solution. Experiments with university athletes' shoes showed that 2-3 minutes of UVC exposure effectively killed bacteria and eliminated the "rotten-cheese-like" smell. This inventive, yet humorous, scientific endeavor aims to improve user experience in everyday life.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, former personal lawyer to President Trump. The lawsuit stemmed from Giuliani's baseless claims that Dominion's machines rigged the 2020 election, which also undermined public confidence and led to threats against election officials. This settlement follows similar agreements with Fox News and Newsmax, which paid significant sums for their roles in spreading election disinformation. Giuliani has faced numerous legal and financial setbacks due to his role, including disbarment and being ordered to pay $148 million to defamed Georgia election workers, highlighting the severe consequences for those who propagate false information undermining election integrity.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been suspended for one WNBA playoff game and fined for aggressively confronting and verbally abusing game officials after her team's loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Her ejection from the court was followed by inappropriate comments to fans and critical remarks about the officiating crew in a post-game press conference. Reeve's anger stemmed from a no-call play where a Lynx player was injured. This unprecedented suspension for a playoff game highlights growing concerns about WNBA officiating, with other coaches also voicing issues regarding physicality and consistency, prompting the league commissioner to acknowledge the need for review.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new Model Y L, a family-friendly electric vehicle, has seen stunning success in China, selling out through October just after its August 2025 launch. Over 35,000 orders were placed on launch day, with new deliveries not expected until November. This strong demand is crucial for Tesla, which has faced global sales struggles, partly due to political factors in the US and regulatory challenges in Europe. The Model Y L's expanded cabin space and lower price point are broadening its appeal, accelerating EV adoption and contributing to reduced heat-trapping transportation pollution, aligning with environmental benefits. This success demonstrates a significant market response to tailored product offerings in the world's largest EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe has established an unprecedented 11½-4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only two and a half more points for retention. Day two at Bethpage Black was marred by "thuggish, moronic and personal insults" from American galleries, particularly directed at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, which European captain Luke Donald condemned. Despite the hostile environment and a minor ruckus between players and caddies, Europe's team delivered an imperious performance, taking both Saturday sessions 3-1.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging remains a subject of debate among experts, despite their popularity. Consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism, noting the challenge of large collagen molecules surviving digestion and reaching skin cells, even in peptide form. While some users report positive changes in skin, hair, and nails, industry-funded studies often show more significant benefits than independent research. Professor Faisal Ali highlights the conflicting information and suggests that laser stimulation and microneedling are more effective for boosting collagen. Ultimately, experts recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as the most impactful strategies for skin health.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether China has surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, 50 years after formal diplomatic relations began and the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China was founded. It references a 1970s observation by European officials who noted China was decades behind in science, technology, and industry after touring numerous facilities. That assessment directly spurred China's "reform and opening up" policy, leading to decades of rapid growth and modernization. The article implicitly questions how this initial technological gap has dramatically evolved over half a century, suggesting a significant shift in global technological leadership and providing a crucial framework for understanding current geopolitical and economic dynamics between the two powers.</p>
