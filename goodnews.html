          <p>Following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship in Syria, business owners are anticipating the end of U.S. sanctions, hoping to revive the country's economy. President Trump announced the sanctions would end, renewing optimism among Syrian business owners who fled during the civil war. While some worry about the conditions attached to lifting the sanctions, many are already planning to return and contribute to rebuilding the war-torn nation. The Syrian economy has suffered greatly, with most of the population living in poverty, and the removal of sanctions is seen as a crucial step towards recovery and stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are finding it increasingly difficult to access their home equity due to elevated interest rates and stricter lending requirements, leading to what experts call "trapped" equity. With many homeowners reluctant to give up their historically low mortgage rates, tapping into equity through cash-out refinancing becomes less appealing. Alternative options like HELOCs and home equity loans can provide access to equity without affecting the existing mortgage rate. Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history are also crucial steps for homeowners seeking to unlock their trapped equity.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could see higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite recent agreements to lower duties on imports from China. Rainey stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. The company is prepared to adjust its buying strategies if consumers react negatively to the higher prices.</p>

          <p>The UK economy has demonstrated surprising resilience, with growth exceeding expectations in the first three months of the year. The 0.7% growth rate signals a return to healthy levels, potentially making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7. While challenges persist for families and small businesses, factors like interest rate cuts and political stability may be contributing to this positive trend. This performance challenges earlier pessimistic predictions and suggests a more robust economic foundation than previously anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have unlocked the genetic code responsible for the distinctive ginger coloring in cats, particularly males. Researchers discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of DNA within the ARHGAP36 gene, leading to lighter pigment production in skin, eye, and fur tone. This breakthrough, crowdfunded by cat lovers, may also shed light on potential health conditions linked to orange coloring. The discovery explains why ginger cats are more commonly male, as the gene is carried on the X chromosome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As retailers reduce orders for foreign goods due to tariffs, companies that recirculate overstocked or returned items, known as reverse logistics companies, are preparing for a surge in demand. ReturnPro and similar businesses sort, clean, and repackage returned goods, selling them to consumers, wholesalers, and off-price retailers. With fewer new goods crossing the Pacific, retailers may turn to refurbished items to fill inventory gaps. This trend highlights the growing importance of the reverse logistics industry in managing returns and mitigating the impact of trade tensions.</p>
