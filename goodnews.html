          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to officially complete the Badwater 135, a grueling 135-mile ultramarathon through Death Valley. He finished the race, known as one of the world's toughest, in under the 48-hour cutoff time, running through extreme heat that reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit. Becker, who only began running in his late 50s, attributes his success to focused training, a dedicated support crew, and a resilient mindset. His journey demonstrates remarkable physical endurance and personal determination at an advanced age.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to foster a new economy based on artificial intelligence and energy. The investments will fund the construction of energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub for workforce training, aiming to create tens of thousands of jobs. The initiative, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, seeks to leverage the state's natural gas and nuclear resources to power AI development. While praised by industry leaders, the summit faced protests from activists concerned about its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having an alibi, wearing an arm cast that would have made firing a gun difficult, and shaky witness testimony. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, and his subsequent lawsuit alleged that sheriff's detectives had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence during the original investigation.</p>

          <h2>Independent UK Review Recommends Changing 'Physician Associate' Title to 'Assistant'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. This follows several high-profile cases where patients suffered harm after being treated by PAs they believed were fully qualified doctors. The British Medical Association, a doctor's union, argues the review's recommendations should have been even stronger.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Lawmakers Reintroduce Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:01:55 EDT</div>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill. The legislation proposes a seven-year "Dignity Program" that would grant legal status and work authority to undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also aims to enhance border security, reform the asylum system, and clear visa backlogs. This reintroduction comes amid heightened scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation program and growing calls for a stable solution for long-term residents.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. The ambitious plan involves moving 1,300 tropical plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and repairing the historic iron structure, which has deteriorated due to the building's hot and humid internal climate. A key goal of the project is to make the Victorian-era glasshouse net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. Horticulturists have already begun the complex process of propagating and relocating the precious plant collection, including a 250-year-old cycad.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Indonesia, averting a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods. Under the new agreement, the tariff rate will be lowered to 19%. In exchange, Trump stated that the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets and that the country has agreed to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest development in the administration's aggressive trade strategy, which has involved threatening steep tariffs to bring numerous countries, including major allies, to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea's former spy chief Kim Jae-gyu is being retried for the 1979 assassination of authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim, who was a close friend of the president, shot Park during a dinner, an act that ended 18 years of military dictatorship. His family fought for the retrial, arguing he was a patriot who acted to prevent further bloodshed and restore democracy, not a traitor seeking power. The court agreed to the retrial based on evidence that Kim was tortured into a confession, reigniting a national debate about his legacy and the country's turbulent path to democracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh, Westinghouse's interim CEO Dan Sumner announced a plan to build 10 new large-scale AP1000 nuclear reactors across the United States, with construction to begin by 2030. The announcement, made directly to President Trump, aligns with the administration's goal to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value. This ambitious plan follows the recent completion of two Westinghouse reactors in Georgia, a project that was notoriously over budget and behind schedule. (not investment advice)</p>
