This epic journey spans five continents and 21 countries, aiming to demonstrate that attending the sport is achievable for a wider audience, not just the wealthy. Burgess, who uses only his annual 28 days of leave from his tech job, is strategically managing costs by varying attendance days and staying in budget accommodations like capsule hostels.

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping are attempting to reset their strained relationship at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, driven by shared concerns over US tariffs. India faces 50% tariffs on goods to the US due to Russian oil purchases, while China's economy is impacted by high US levies. This meeting marks a potential turning point for the two economic powerhouses, despite long-standing border disputes and other geopolitical fault lines. Both nations seek to leverage their strengths to reduce reliance on the United States and reshape global trade flows.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest in the game's history, following Saturday night's drawing without a grand prize winner. The cash value for Monday's drawing is projected at $498.4 million. This marks the sixth time the top prize has reached the billion-dollar threshold in the game's 33-year history, with four of the five previous billion-plus winners hailing from California. Hope now turns to the next drawing for players across 45 states.</p>

          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are using innovative methods, including drones that blast AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and Scarlett Johansson movie clips, to protect cattle from wolves. This experiment aims to create non-lethal deterrents for the recovering gray wolf population, which has led to increased conflicts with ranchers. While the technology is expensive and has limitations in wooded areas, early trials show success in scaring wolves and interrupting hunts. The goal is to foster coexistence by reducing livestock losses and the associated stress on ranchers.</p>

This trend reflects a growing health consciousness among younger Germans, who are consuming alcohol more mindfully.

          <p>UK government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including drones, sniffer dogs, and atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, a major threat to British forests. This beetle, which has devastated European spruce trees, is now arriving in the UK via wind, not just imported wood. The innovative methods have successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England. However, climate change, causing stressed trees and larger beetle populations in Europe, poses an increasing challenge to ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
