          <p>Center Myles Turner has finalized a four-year, $107 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, leaving the Indiana Pacers after a decade. Turner attributed his departure to 'alignment issues' with the Pacers' organization, a decision influenced by the uncertainty following Tyrese Haliburton's Achilles injury. While acknowledging the difficulty of leaving the team that drafted him, Turner expressed excitement about the opportunity with the Bucks, stating it was the best fit for his career and personal goals moving forward.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's space economy is poised for massive growth, projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, driven by a surge in private investment. The piece highlights successful private Chinese aerospace firms like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones, such as launching rockets into orbit. It suggests that as the space sector shifts from state-led missions to commercial ventures, Hong Kong is well-positioned to play a crucial role in this expansion, contributing to a new era for China's space ambitions.

A leading demographer argues that this technological shift, while disruptive to traditional family structures, could redefine life and social norms, making conventional concerns about population numbers less relevant in an AI-driven future.</p>
