          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias to the U.S. to face charges of cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and firearms violations. Macias, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June following a high-profile escape from a maximum-security prison in January. His escape prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens to a foreign country, signaling a significant step in the nation's fight against powerful drug cartels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues against the conventional wisdom that looming tariff deadlines will harm the stock market, particularly highly valued stocks. He presents ten factors that he believes are buoying the market, including strong corporate earnings, pro-business tax relief from the "One Big Beautiful Bill," and massive investment needs for data centers and the electric grid. Cramer suggests these elements will stimulate the economy and create a boom, countering the negative narrative surrounding trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
