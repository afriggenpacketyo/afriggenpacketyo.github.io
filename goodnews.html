        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerate nuclear reactor deployment, focusing on small, advanced reactors while supporting larger plants. The orders mandate NRC decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months and aim to reorganize the agency, potentially leading to staff reductions. Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez emphasized that regulatory delays have been a major issue, and the new framework also allows the Departments of Energy and Defense to build reactors on federal land for defense and AI data centers. Additionally, the orders seek to boost uranium mining and reactor testing at national laboratories, reflecting growing investment in nuclear power after a period of industry financial struggles.</p>

          <p>Nearly a decade after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room, eight defendants were found guilty of crimes related to the incident. The panel of judges delivered the verdict in a Paris courtroom, finding eight of the ten defendants guilty and acquitting two others. Kardashian testified during the trial, recounting the harrowing experience and expressing her fear for her life. The suspects, dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their age, were accused of stealing millions of dollars' worth of jewelry, including a diamond engagement ring from Kanye West.

          <p>New Jersey is preparing for its gubernatorial elections, with primaries next month potentially signaling the national mood for the 2026 midterms. The Democratic primary features a crowded field including U.S. Reps.

Republicans are aiming to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli, who has shifted his stance on Trump over the years.

          <p>The FDA has issued a warning regarding cetirizine (Zyrtec) and levocetirizine (Xyzal), noting that some patients may experience severe itching after discontinuing long-term use.

In most cases, restarting the medication resolved the issue, and the FDA plans to update prescribing information to include a warning about the itching risk.

The bill also includes a tax break for overtime pay, but both provisions have restrictions and expire after 2028.

It updates California's rules to align with federal laws against human trafficking and seeks to prevent taxpayer money from funding abusive supply chains.
