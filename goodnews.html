          <p>Matthew McConaughey stars alongside his 93-year-old mother and 17-year-old son, Levi, in "The Lost Bus," a film depicting the harrowing 2018 California wildfires. The Oscar-winning actor portrays Kevin McKay, a school bus driver guiding 22 schoolchildren and their teacher through a raging inferno to safety. Director Paul Greengrass, known for his focus on realism, cast McConaughey's family to enhance the film's authenticity, with Levi securing his role after persistently asking to audition. The movie is a real-life depiction of the devastation that killed 85 people and displaced over 50,000, resonating with recent global wildfire events and speaking to universal themes of grappling with leaving things too late.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama, speaking in London, articulated his view that America is embroiled in a profound "tug of war" between two distinct visions for its future. He criticized a progressive ideology that became "smug" and "complacent" in previous decades, contrasting it with a populist, conservative worldview, which he attributed to his successor. Obama suggested this conservative vision seeks a return to an older, more exclusive interpretation of national identity, where "we, the people" applies only to some. He underscored that deeply held values are currently undergoing significant testing.</p>

          <p>"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" experienced a significant ratings surge, drawing an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers upon the comedian's return to ABC, despite being preempted by about a quarter of U.S. affiliate TV stations. This audience was nearly four times larger than the show's average, marking its highest ratings since March 2015. Kimmel's monologue also garnered over 26 million views across YouTube and other social platforms, showcasing immense public interest. The temporary suspension followed controversial comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination, which ignited a widespread debate over free speech and network decisions, though ABC ultimately reinstated the show.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to mandate state cooperation with immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. The decision sided with 20 predominantly Democratic states that argued the administration was unlawfully "holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage." The court deemed the policy "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," emphasizing the irreparable harm to states and public safety if disaster funds were withheld. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for Trump's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has commenced its annual Fat Bear Week 2025, featuring 12 brown bears competing for the title of fattest bear. The public can vote online from September 23-30 as these animals intensely bulk up for winter hibernation, with some gaining up to 700 pounds to reach over 1,400 pounds—a critical adaptation for survival. The event, which includes livestreams, aims to make the remote park accessible and educate the public about bear ecology and the importance of their impressive weight gain. The ultimate "prize" for the winning bear is simply surviving another harsh winter season.</p>

          <h2>FDA Considers Approving Off-Label Drug Leucovorin for Autism Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 19:50:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is initiating the process to approve leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug, as an off-label treatment for autism, despite the absence of large-scale clinical trials. Leucovorin, derived from folic acid, is currently prescribed for chemotherapy side effects, but preliminary evidence suggests it can significantly improve speech in some autistic children by bypassing a brain folic acid transport blockage. Researchers like Dr. Richard Frye, who has decades of work in this area, welcome the FDA's interest but caution against premature approval without further research, physician education, and reliable manufacturing. Funding for this low-profit generic drug remains a key challenge.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter was situated at a shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers, approximately 24 kilometers from Mene Grande, an oil town in the sparsely populated state of Zulia. While the tremor caused buildings to shake and generated alarm in cities including Caracas and Maracaibo, there were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage. Strong earthquakes are not common in Venezuela, but this event was also felt across neighboring Colombia and several Caribbean islands.</p>

He expressed gratitude to supporters, including some conservatives, for defending his right to free speech, while also explaining his disagreement with ABC's decision to pull the show.

          <p>Orange County Public School officials are actively contemplating school closures and consolidations as a direct response to declining enrollment, with some campuses currently operating at less than 40% capacity. School board member Melissa Byrd confirmed these initial discussions, emphasizing that no final decisions have been reached regarding which specific schools might be affected. The district's decreasing student population necessitates a strategic reevaluation of its resources to ensure optimal efficiency and the continued delivery of high-quality education for all students. These measures aim to adapt to changing demographics and optimize facility usage.</p>

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers urged "realism" after his team's Europa League opening draw against Red Star Belgrade, contrasting it with previous Champions League aspirations. Following a painful play-off defeat, the Scottish champions are now in the second-tier competition, with Rodgers emphasizing the importance of securing a first point in a difficult away fixture. Despite recent criticism over summer transfer activity and concerns about a "stale" squad, the introduction of goalscorer Kelechi Iheanacho provided a crucial focal point and ignited their play. Rodgers highlighted the challenges of the venue, suggesting the draw was a commendable result for the current squad.</p>

          <p>Screenwriter Steven Knight, acclaimed for "Peaky Blinders," is launching "House of Guinness" on Netflix, a new series exploring the intense power struggles within Ireland's renowned brewing dynasty after Sir Benjamin Guinness's death. Knight found the real-life Guinness family history inherently dramatic, blending fact and fiction to create compelling narratives. James Norton, who plays foreman Sean Rafferty, praised the script and the opportunity to research the historical context. The series, featuring a largely Irish cast, aims to showcase Irish storytelling on a global scale, with Knight acknowledging similarities in "energy, humour and swagger" to his previous work.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald intensified the rivalry by asserting his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a pointed remark at American players receiving $500,000 stipends. Donald emphasized that pride, national representation, and the legacy left behind are the core motivators for the European team, who are not compensated for playing. American players, including Collin Morikawa, dismissed the notion that payment diminishes their desire to win, explaining that the funds enable them to support their teams and donate to charities. The payment structure has, however, drawn criticism for not aligning with the Ryder Cup's traditional ethos.</p>
