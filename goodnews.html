          <p>The U.S. has announced a new energy and trade partnership with Pakistan, focusing on the joint development of Pakistan's oil reserves and lowering tariffs on Pakistani imports. President Trump unveiled the deal, which also includes a reduction of the U.S. tariff rate on Pakistani goods to 19%. While Pakistan's proven oil reserves are modest, the agreement is seen as a strategic shift towards economic cooperation, potentially attracting investment and technology. The deal also carries geopolitical weight, as it could counter China's influence in the region and give the U.S. a strategic presence in Balochistan. (not investment advice)</p>

The family is living on a talent visa obtained for his wife, who is starting a hospitality business.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) present a viable alternative to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. With the average homeowner holding significant equity, these products offer substantially lower interest rates, which are expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve implements more rate cuts. As of late July 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans hover around 8.41%, while HELOCs are near 8.26%. The article advises homeowners to shop around for the best terms, as individual offers can vary significantly based on multiple factors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of locking in rates for a set term. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 1-year CDs reaching 4.40% APY. The article notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently provide higher rates than long-term ones. To maximize returns, savers are advised to explore online banks, consider short-term CDs, and potentially use a laddering strategy to balance high yields with long-term savings goals.

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high rates, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still find affordable options, especially with strong credit. As of late July 2025, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.78%, while a 30-year refinance rate is slightly higher at 6.86%. The article suggests that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, individuals are advised to improve their credit profiles, shop around with different lenders, and consider the loan term, as shorter 15-year loans typically offer lower interest rates.

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE detention after being held for two months in Louisiana. She was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, despite having just given birth to her second child. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, expressed frustration, stating he felt betrayed by the system. The family's case highlights the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement priorities, which are now taking precedence over the deference previously given to military families, as they now work to dismiss a prior deportation order.</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts are presented as a strong option for savers looking to protect their money from inflation and build an emergency fund. While the national average interest rate for savings accounts is a mere 0.38%, top online banks are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30% APY. The article emphasizes that these accounts, often provided by online banks with lower overhead costs, can significantly boost savings over time compared to traditional accounts. Consumers are encouraged to compare different high-yield options, paying attention to both interest rates and any associated fees to maximize their earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular safe-haven asset for investors, particularly during times of economic uncertainty and inflation. As of late July 2025, the price of gold stood at $3,313.08 per ounce, though its value is subject to constant fluctuation. The article details several key factors that influence gold's price, including supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, currency movements, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks play a significant role in determining the precious metal's market value.

          <p>The new director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Joseph Edlow, is calling for a significant overhaul of the naturalization process, arguing the current test is "too soft." In an interview, Edlow stated the civics and English exam does not adequately assess an applicant's understanding of American history, government, and language fluency. He proposes a more comprehensive evaluation of English skills throughout the interview and a test that better reflects congressional intent for assimilation. The director also signaled intentions to tighten oversight of the H-1B visa program and revisit the "public charge" rule.</p>

The collaboration will integrate Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The new craft, based on Joby's S4 design but equipped with a gas turbine, is intended for applications like surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments. This partnership reflects a growing military interest in smaller, more adaptable, and potentially autonomous aircraft as an alternative to traditional, more expensive platforms like Apache helicopters.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the "Happy Gilmore" movies, including the new sequel, are more than just comedies, instead conveying a traditional conservative message about the importance of family. The author contends that the protagonist, Happy, is consistently motivated not by personal gain but by altruistic obligations to his family, first to save his grandmother's house and later to support his daughter's dream. This focus on prioritizing family over self is presented as a core theme. The author notes that Adam Sandler, who has a history as a registered Republican, reinforces this personal message by casting his own wife and daughter in the sequel.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an initial offer from Liverpool for 25-year-old striker Alexander Isak. The Swedish international is reportedly valued by Newcastle at around £150 million, with Liverpool's bid, said to be £110 million plus add-ons, falling short of that figure. Isak was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour and is training alone as he explores a potential move away from the club. It remains uncertain if Liverpool will return with an improved offer, but manager Arne Slot is reportedly keen to add the striker to his squad after a summer of heavy spending.</p>

          <p>Stephen Starring Grant's new book, "Mailman," is a memoir detailing his experience working for the U.S. Postal Service in rural Virginia after being laid off from a corporate marketing job during the pandemic. The book serves as an ethnography of a rural post office, an indictment of government austerity, and a reflection on the meaning of public service. Grant, a self-aware "interloper" in the blue-collar world, provides an empathetic look at his co-workers and the community he serves. The review highlights the book's exploration of the dignity of manual labor and the remarkable, often-strained efficiency of the USPS.</p>
