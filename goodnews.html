          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that Europe's Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for their upcoming title defense on American soil: virtual reality headsets that simulate hostile crowd abuse. Captain Luke Donald introduced the technology to help players desensitize themselves to the intense environment expected at Bethpage, New York. McIlroy stated he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," acknowledging that while it is a useful tool, nothing can fully replicate the pressure of the actual event. This innovative approach highlights the team's detailed preparations as they aim for their first victory in the U.S. since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are offering their predictions for the postseason, with many highlighting the Minnesota Lynx as a top contender for the championship. After a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, the Lynx have been on a "revenge tour," boasting the league's top defense and elite shooting. Other high-seeded teams like the Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, and Phoenix Mercury are also seen as strong contenders in a highly competitive field. The article's contributors debate which teams are at risk for an early exit and which players, such as Napheesa Collier and A'ja Wilson, will be most pivotal.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle as stocks with significant long-term growth potential, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom's recent success is attributed to accelerating AI demand and its VMware business, securing a new $10 billion customer. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler has shown strong performance with its Zero Trust and AI security solutions, while Oracle's stock surged due to robust cloud growth projections and massive multi-billion-dollar contracts. These endorsements reflect confidence in the companies' ability to capitalize on current technology trends. (not investment advice)</p>

The Chinese and American representatives, led by Vice-Premier He Lifeng and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai's senior advisor Bruce Bessent respectively, convened at the Spanish foreign ministry.

          <p>As the UK Labour Party's popularity declines, some political observers are looking to Zohran Mamdani's successful mayoral primary campaign in New York for potential lessons. Mamdani, a progressive Democrat, has gained significant traction with a clear focus on economic affordability, proposing popular policies like free bus transport and a rent freeze, funded by taxes on the wealthy. Analysts suggest Labour could learn from his ability to craft a compelling narrative, champion specific policies, and effectively use social media to connect with voters. Mamdani's success highlights the power of an authentic, issues-focused campaign in an era of widespread political disillusionment.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable display of courage, doctors at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during one of the most intense Russian missile attacks on the city. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team drove through explosions to retrieve a donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. They then successfully completed the transplant surgery as the hospital building shook from nearby blasts. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering, offering a powerful story of resilience and dedication amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Oscar Eagle, who was sentenced to 25-years-to-life for a gang-related shooting he committed as a teenager, has been exonerated and released from prison after serving over two decades. His 1998 arrest was made by detectives from the LAPD's corrupt C.R.A.S.H. unit, and his conviction was secured despite a strong alibi and evidence he was physically incapable of committing the crime. A judge vacated his conviction, citing ineffective legal counsel and questionable police conduct, including a detective seemingly coaching the victim to identify Eagle. The case highlights the lasting impact of the Rampart scandal and issues with prosecuting juveniles as adults.</p>

          <p>A detailed report recounts the story of Leah Marx, a young FBI agent whose investigation into inmate abuse allegations in 2010 exposed deep-seated corruption within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department under then-Sheriff Lee Baca. Marx's undercover work, which included a sting operation involving a contraband cellphone, was met with an aggressive obstruction campaign by Baca's department, including hiding an informant and threatening Marx with arrest. This response escalated the federal probe, ultimately leading to the conviction of 22 department members, including Baca himself, for civil rights violations, corruption, and obstruction of justice.</p>

          <p>After her first year in office, Mexico's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, continues to enjoy high approval ratings above 70%, successfully navigating domestic and international pressures. She has advanced key constitutional reforms, overseen a drop in homicides, and managed a delicate relationship with U.S. President Trump, particularly on immigration and security. While continuing the populist projects of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Sheinbaum has adopted a more diplomatic tone and a tougher stance on organized crime. However, challenges loom, primarily the volatile economic and security relationship with the Trump administration.</p>
