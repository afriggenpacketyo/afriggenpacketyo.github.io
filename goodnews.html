          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER), which is based in France, is showcasing fusion energy technology at the World Exposition in Osaka. ITER's exhibits explain the fusion energy process and highlight the experimental reactor being built in southern France. Japan, the host of the six-month event, is emphasizing its contribution to the project, which involves China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union. Fusion energy, often called "the Sun on Earth," is seen as a clean energy source but is still decades away from practical application.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Public Favors Regulation of Social Media in Elections</h2>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises amidst growing concerns about partisan online posts influencing election outcomes. While Japan recently enacted legislation to facilitate the removal of defamatory content, its impact has been limited. The survey also highlights divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Blue Ivy Carter, daughter of Beyonc√©, has been praised for her performances on the Cowboy Carter tour, sparking a debate about "nepo babies" and whether she is a genuine talent or benefiting from her mother's fame. While some critics say her opportunities are largely due to her parentage, others acknowledge her talent and work ethic. Her grandmother, Tina Knowles, emphasized that Blue Ivy and her siblings are encouraged to pursue their own interests but are not being forced into show business. The discussion highlights broader concerns about the influence of celebrity parents on their children's careers.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, designed to bolster the country's private economy. The law aims to provide legal recourse for private firms, particularly against local-level governments. Observers are closely watching how the law will impact firms' ability to litigate against government actions and protect themselves from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. The legislation forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes and unscrupulous fine collections.</p>

Carney also plans to visit the White House to discuss tariffs and strengthen relationships with other trading partners. He has also offered an olive branch to political rivals, calling for unity in addressing the country's challenges.</p>
