          <p>LGBTQ+ communities around the world, from New York City to Budapest, capped off Pride Month with large-scale marches that blended celebration with protest. In the U.S., events highlighted resistance against recent political and legislative attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals. In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on their parade, marching in protest of Hungary's restrictive laws. The global events underscored a dual theme of joyful defiance and a continued fight for rights and inclusion in an increasingly challenging political climate.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered a fractured skull after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's wildlife center provided nearly five months of intensive care, focusing on medical treatment while carefully preserving the cub's wild instincts and aversion to humans. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released into a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The successful outcome highlights the crucial work of wildlife rehabilitation programs.</p>

          <p>The search for the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, declared extinct in 1986, continues to captivate enthusiasts in Australia. Thousands of reported sightings, though unconfirmed, fuel a dedicated community of seekers who use trail cams and forensic techniques to search for evidence of the creature's survival. The obsession is also being pursued in the lab, where a $15 million de-extinction project aims to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative. While skeptics call the project impossible, the enduring hope reflects a deep cultural connection to the lost animal.</p>

          <p>Renowned German filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, continues to create distinctive films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. A recent profile examines his six-decade career, marked by a relentless and often extreme pursuit of his artistic vision, such as physically hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who describes his approach as requiring "good criminal energy," believes his prose will outlive his films and continues to teach his unconventional methods to aspiring filmmakers, emphasizing grit and real-life experience over formal training.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its blanket ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring showed no abnormalities, leading to the conditional resumption of imports. The move is viewed as a potential step toward improving diplomatic and trade relations between the two Asian neighbors, though restrictions will remain on food from prefectures near the Fukushima site.</p>

The return would be accomplished through a combination of archived footage, digital effects, and stand-ins, similar to how Walker's appearance was completed for "Furious 7" after his death in 2013.</p>
