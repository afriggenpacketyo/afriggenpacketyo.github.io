        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK railway management. The newly nationalized service will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, with the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator assuming responsibility for SWR trains. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized improvements to services and reinvestment of profits into infrastructure but refrained from promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about potential outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservative opposition insists Labour must fulfill its promises.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if they gain power. This announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced internal Labour divisions over both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. Starmer has already announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, while privately considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap amid growing unrest within his party.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches have opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, falling short of the required staffing levels due to a persistent shortage. City officials are optimistic that staffing will increase as students finish classes and summer approaches, with 374 new lifeguards in training. Despite the shortage, beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, providing a sense of security. The city has implemented incentives like increased hourly wages and signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards and has improved lifeguard stations to make the job more appealing.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament in a move seen as a statement of sovereignty against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. This is the first time since 1977 that a British monarch has delivered Canada's throne speech, and it signifies a stronger support for the Crown. The invitation is a response to Trump's undermining of Canada's sovereignty and the imposition of tariffs that threatened its economic stability. While most Canadians are indifferent to the monarchy, the move is intended to emphasize Canada's distinct identity from the United States.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advise against performing due to exacerbated symptoms, and Joel is undergoing physical therapy, hoping to return to the stage. NPH involves cerebrospinal fluid buildup in the brain, leading to walking difficulties, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence. While treatable with surgery to drain excess fluid, early diagnosis is crucial, and awareness from Joel's public disclosure may help others seek timely medical attention.</p>
