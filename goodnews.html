          <p>In Damascus, firefighters from opposing sides of the Syrian civil war are working together to rebuild trust and provide essential services.  Former regime firefighters and members of the White Helmets, a volunteer rescue organization, are learning to collaborate in a shared firehouse. This collaboration represents a small step towards reconciliation in a city marked by deep divisions and years of conflict. The firefighters' efforts symbolize hope for the future as they work side-by-side.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Bakersfield with a rare medical condition has been granted humanitarian protection from deportation, allowing her to continue receiving lifesaving treatment in the United States.  The Trump administration had initially rescinded the legal protections of the girl and her parents, who are from Mexico.  Her doctor stated that she could die within days of losing medical care for short bowel syndrome.  The decision followed public outcry and advocacy from lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Dollar General's shares rose nearly 16% after raising its outlook, citing an increase in middle- and higher-income shoppers amid tariff concerns. The company beat quarterly expectations for revenue and earnings, anticipating net sales growth of 3.7% to 4.7%.  CEO Todd Vasos stated the company has worked to reduce its exposure to China and limit price hikes for shoppers, mitigating tariff impacts. Vasos added tariffs have also increased U.S. consumers' desire to find deep discounts, benefitting Dollar General.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to waive certain legal requirements to boost domestic production of critical minerals and weapons.  The action applies to the Defense Production Act, granting the president broad emergency powers to control domestic industries and resources during national security emergencies. The waiver would allow Trump to bypass congressional approval for projects over $50 million and the one-year project delivery timeframe, similar to waivers invoked by President Biden during the COVID pandemic.</p>
