          <p>A sea otter in Santa Cruz, California, is once again exhibiting aggressive behavior towards surfers and stealing their boards, echoing the actions of the famous otter 841 from two years prior. The current otter's identity remains unconfirmed due to the absence of a flipper tag, though its modus operandi is almost identical. Federal wildlife officials previously attempted to capture otter 841 in 2023, but she evaded them and eventually stopped chasing surfboards after giving birth. This article highlights that the California Department of Fish and Wildlife currently has no plans to intervene, leaving local surfers to navigate the curious and bold interactions with the marine mammal.</p>

          <h2>September CPI Report Indicates Inflation Rise Below Forecasts</h2>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts of 3.1%, with the impact of President Trump's tariffs remaining somewhat muted. This critical inflation data was released despite the ongoing government shutdown, as it is essential for determining the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment. Economists indicate that while inflation is edging higher due to tariffs, businesses are absorbing some costs, though up to 55% of import taxes are still passed on to consumers. The recent rise in inflation complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, yet a quarter-point cut at next week's meeting remains highly anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern Scotland where daylight can shrink to barely six hours, many people experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This article details SAD symptoms, including lowered mood, irritability, and a loss of interest in everyday activities, and discusses various coping strategies. Professor Hester Parr, leading the 'Living with Sad' project, advocates for creative and cultural resources, building new "light routines," and the use of therapeutic lamps, now being distributed in Orkney libraries. Drawing lessons from Scandinavian nations, the article emphasizes creating cozy interior light environments and actively embracing outdoor activities to mitigate the effects of reduced daylight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of UK Members of Parliament has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. The Treasury Select Committee's report concluded that such cuts are unlikely to achieve the intended effect of promoting an investment culture in the UK. With the Chancellor facing a significant £22bn Budget shortfall and reportedly considering tax rises or spending cuts, a reduction to the cash ISA limit, potentially to £10,000, had been contemplated. However, the committee, supported by banks and consumer campaigners, firmly argues that this is not the opportune moment for such a change, given the current economic landscape.

          <p>UK motorists are increasingly facing a dilemma over whether to learn in a manual or automatic car, a trend driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and the growing prevalence of electric vehicles. While one in three cars on UK roads is now an automatic, many aspiring drivers, like Caitlin Graham, still find themselves learning manual due to a scarcity and higher cost of automatic instructors. This article highlights the "boxed in" consequence of an automatic-only license versus the broader flexibility offered by a manual. Despite a common misconception that automatic tests are easier, official DVSA figures indicate that manual tests actually have a higher pass rate.</p>

          <p>This article explores the booming popularity of magnesium supplements, often touted as a "miracle mineral" for sleep, digestion, and mental health, with the global market nearing £3bn. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including brain and mood regulation, dietitians caution against automatic supplementation without a proven deficiency, which is difficult to test for. Social media influencers often promote various magnesium compounds for specific ailments, but strong scientific evidence for their efficacy in healthy individuals is often lacking. Experts recommend prioritizing dietary sources and consulting professionals before taking supplements due to potential risks.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has hired 36 immigration judges, including 25 temporary ones, for its Executive Office for Immigration Review, marking the first new class to join the immigration courts after months of workforce reductions. These judges will be deployed across 16 states, including areas that experienced significant losses earlier this year. The article notes that the incoming class comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds, predominantly from federal government work, and includes military lawyers. This strategic hiring aims to alleviate the immense backlog of millions of cases in immigration courts, a challenge exacerbated by the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, even as courts continue to operate during the government shutdown.</p>
