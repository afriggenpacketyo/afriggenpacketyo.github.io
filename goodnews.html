          <p>The community of Kerrville, Texas, still recovering from severe flash flooding in July, gathered for the opening high school football game in a display of unity and healing. The Tivy Antler varsity team's season opener was held at Antler Stadium, the same venue that served as a central hub for volunteers and a memorial site in the aftermath of the natural disaster. The event highlights the cultural significance of Friday night football in Texas as a tradition that can bring people together and provide a sense of normalcy during difficult times. The game against Del Rio represented a step forward for the flood-ravaged town.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint operation between Cardiff Council and South Wales Police has resulted in the seizure of 135 illegal e-bikes and scooters, some modified to reach dangerously high speeds. One confiscated vehicle was capable of 86 mph but had no functioning brakes, while another ridden by a teenager could reach 70 mph. The crackdown targeted antisocial behavior and safety violations, as any e-bike exceeding 15.5 mph or with a motor over 250 watts is classified as a motor vehicle requiring legal compliance. The seized bikes are being dismantled and scrapped to prevent their return to the streets.</p>

The article also notes that American player Jessica Pegula advanced to the quarter-finals in the women's draw.

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey advised a 61-year-old mother against taking out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off a $27,000 car she financed for her daughter. The mother explained that her daughter failed to refinance the loan as promised and has been accumulating traffic tickets, leaving her responsible for the debt. Ramsey stated that the gift had become a burden and recommended selling the car, even at a loss, to resolve the unmanageable debt. He suggested taking a smaller loan to cover any shortfall from the sale and to help her daughter purchase a more affordable vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

Will Jacks was the star performer, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls to help his team post a total of 168-5. In response, the Trent Rockets' chase faltered, largely due to a remarkable spell from leg-spinner Nathan Sowter, who took three crucial wickets. Despite a late effort from Marcus Stoinis, who scored 64, the Rockets finished short at 142-8, cementing another dominant season for the London-based team in the 100-ball cricket competition.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The order came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for departure from Texas. Attorneys for the children argued the deportations would be illegal, depriving them of due process and the right to seek asylum, potentially returning them to dangerous situations. The government contended it was reuniting the children with relatives in Guatemala at their families' request, a claim disputed by the children's advocates. The judge's order will remain in effect for 14 days while the legal case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 at Anfield thanks to a spectacular late free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in the 83rd minute. The match was a cautious and tactical affair, with both teams showing immense respect for each other and creating few clear-cut chances. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative approach was criticized in the article for failing to challenge a Liverpool defense that had appeared vulnerable in previous games. The victory gives Liverpool a perfect start to the season with three wins, extending Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield, which dates back to 2012.</p>

          <p>A new tropical system, named Kiko, has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean over 1,000 miles from the Mexican coast. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm currently poses no immediate threat to land. Tropical Storm Kiko is the eleventh named storm of the season in the region and is moving westward. Forecasters expect the system to strengthen over the next few days, predicting that it will likely intensify into a hurricane by Tuesday. Currently, its maximum sustained winds are at 40 mph, just above the threshold for a tropical storm.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of a large bandage and stitch marks, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is typically slow-growing with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to offer public advice, having previously advocated for wearing helmets after a serious bicycle accident.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, achieved his second recorded hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The ace occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass, where he used a single shot to cover the 177-yard distance. His first hole-in-one came less than a year ago at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. The accomplishment highlights the young golfer's developing talent as he continues to follow in the footsteps of his famous father, who has 10 recorded aces in his career.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates operating in the North Atlantic. The agreement is seen as a major success for the UK's defense industry, having been chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This marks the 40th consecutive drawing without a grand prize winner since the last jackpot was won on May 31. While the top prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including four tickets in Massachusetts that won significant amounts. One ticket sold in Worcester won $1 million, and three other tickets sold across the state each won $50,000. The next drawing for the massive jackpot will be held on Monday night.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting in Copenhagen, European Union foreign ministers discussed new ways to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas floated were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production within the "safe haven" of EU countries like Denmark. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing some €200 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Additionally, there was broad support for a plan to eventually shift the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian soil.</p>
