          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from two toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, to expedite their challenge to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products. The companies argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to impose these tariffs. The court's decision means the Trump administration has the standard 30-day period to respond to the challenge, delaying any potential resolution. The companies sought to bypass a federal appeals court due to the tariffs' significant impact on businesses and consumers, but the Supreme Court's ruling means the case will proceed through the regular legal channels. The author's tone is relatively neutral, reflecting the factual nature of the court's decision and its implications for the companies involved.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the projected monthly payments for a $100,000 annuity if purchased at age 65, noting that retirement planning in 2025 requires dependable sources of income. According to an analysis of Cannex data, a 65-year-old male can expect about $652 per month, while a 65-year-old female can expect about $627 per month. These figures depend on factors such as gender, the interest rate environment, the type of annuity, payout structure, and optional features. The article concludes that a $100,000 annuity won't replace a full salary in retirement, but it can offer meaningful supplemental income, especially when paired with Social Security and other savings.

          <h2>Scottish Government to Ban WhatsApp on Official Devices</h2>

          <p>The Scottish government will discontinue the use of WhatsApp and other "non-corporate" messaging services for government business on its mobile devices. This decision follows revelations from the UK Covid Inquiry regarding the deletion of WhatsApp messages by officials and ministers during the pandemic. The move aims to enhance "openness and transparency" in government, although opposition MSPs view it as an admission of past errors. Emergency and security teams will phase out the app by the end of the year, with corporate-approved apps like Teams and email being the preferred alternatives.</p>

          <h2>FDA Proposes Plan to Expedite Some Drug Reviews</h2>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan to expedite drug reviews for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." The plan aims to reduce drug review times to one-to-two months, significantly faster than the current 10-month deadline. The FDA plans to give a limited number of vouchers to companies aligned with "national health priorities," including addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. The Trump administration encourages pharmaceutical companies to reshore drug manufacturing through executive orders and potential tariffs on imported medicines.</p>
