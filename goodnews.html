          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth, driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector, surpassed economists' expectations. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has already loosened monetary policy, and low inflation figures may support further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is intensifying its efforts to combat a national shortage of air traffic controllers, aiming to hire 2,000 new personnel by the end of the year. Utilizing advanced simulation technology at its Oklahoma City training facility, the FAA has cut weeks off the certification time and streamlined the administrative hiring process. This initiative, part of a larger $12.5 billion infrastructure boost, comes in response to staffing shortages that caused flight delays at major airports. Officials report they are on track to meet their hiring goals, with a record number of students currently in training.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:25:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts as businesses rushed shipments during a temporary tariff truce with the United States. In a significant reversal of this year's trend, imports also saw a 1.1% rise, marking the first increase in 2025 and suggesting a potential stabilization in domestic demand. The data reflects exporters' efforts to diversify markets away from the U.S. toward regions like Southeast Asia. Officials from both nations are reportedly working to implement a recent trade framework ahead of an August deadline to secure a more durable agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent advocate for women's rights in France, has received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She is recognized for her courage in publicly testifying about being drugged and sexually assaulted by her ex-husband, who also invited dozens of other men to abuse her over a decade. Her insistence on a public trial led to the conviction of 51 men and ignited a national conversation about sexual violence. Pelicot's actions are credited with influencing legislative reforms that now incorporate a lack of consent into France's legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market shows signs of slowing. Stating that he believes the path for rates is "downward," Bailey noted signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This outlook comes as the UK economy contracted slightly in May and the government faces pressure to boost economic growth. The Bank's monetary policy committee will review the current 4.25% interest rate at its next meeting in August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in the academic priorities of Chinese students, with a strong preference for technology and engineering-related fields. Driven by a state-led push to bolster technological self-sufficiency amid competition with the U.S., subjects like information technology and vehicle engineering have become top choices. This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were more popular. The focus on engineering disciplines is reshaping China's higher education landscape, funneling a new generation of talent into fields deemed critical for future industrial and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the hospitality industry, observes that today's tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that younger, more seasoned travelers are less interested in traditional group tours and are instead seeking unique, authentic experiences that allow for interaction with local communities. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," a shift from predominantly Western tourists to a diverse, global mix of travelers from developing nations. This evolution has rendered one-size-fits-all tourism offerings obsolete, pushing the industry toward more personalized and experiential models.</p>

This unbroken handwritten ledger provides an invaluable historical record of climate change, documenting major meteorological events and shifts in weather patterns over centuries.

The development comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to take a stronger stance against Russia.
