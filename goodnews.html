          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom during a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 Summit. Trump accidentally dropped the document, blaming the wind, and initially misidentified it as an agreement with the European Union. The White House later clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK and that the Commerce Secretary will determine quotas for steel and aluminum products entering the U.S. without tariffs. Trump also complimented Starmer's performance as Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle sent in 1983 was discovered on Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia by an archaeology technician. The bottle, which still smelled of gin, contained a faded letter and a 1974 two-dollar bill. The letter was sent from the resupply ship Wimpey Sea Hunter, and park officials are attempting to locate any surviving crew members. Similar discoveries are not uncommon, with one message dating back to the 1930s, while park officials have also found appliances and waste washing ashore.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China is increasing its influence in international development finance and regional economic cooperation as the United States reduces foreign aid and increases financial sanctions. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Development Bank, proposed by China in 2010, is now closer to becoming a reality due to rising geopolitical tensions and Russia's shift towards Asia. Momentum is building ahead of the SCO summit in Tianjin, where leaders are expected to discuss the bank and related initiatives for local currency settlement and digital finance.</p>

The agreement establishes the non-profit "Hohenzollern Art Foundation" to manage the art and cultural objects, ensuring they remain accessible to the public.

          <p>A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 75 can provide a significant monthly income, with payments ranging from approximately $3,173 to $3,415 for single individuals, depending on gender. Joint-life options, which cover two people, typically offer lower monthly payments, around $2,736. Factors such as gender, interest rates, annuity structure, and optional riders can affect the monthly income. Purchasing an annuity at this age requires careful consideration of one's financial situation, health, and legacy goals (not investment advice).</p>
