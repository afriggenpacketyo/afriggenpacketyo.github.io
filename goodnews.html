          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby voiced optimism regarding the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) overhaul, highlighting bipartisan commitment and funding for the project. Kirby acknowledged recent air traffic control outages and delays, particularly at Newark Liberty International Airport, but emphasized that safety remains the aviation industry's top priority. He outlined backup procedures, including alternative frequencies and radar systems, to ensure safe skies during outages. Kirby mentioned United has proactively reduced flights to alleviate airport congestion, and stressed that slowing down the system is a deliberate safety measure that can disrupt customers.</p>

          <p>London Stansted Airport experienced significant delays due to an IT issue that affected check-in, baggage handling, and security systems, leading to long queues extending outside the terminal building. Passengers faced hours-long waits, with some missing their flights as a result of the disruption. While the IT issue has been resolved, departing flights may still experience delays, and the airport has apologized to passengers, advising them to stay in contact with their airlines. Engineers are working to fully restore all systems as quickly as possible to mitigate further disruptions.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests the creation of "Father's Day Month" to follow Mother's Day, proposing a 35-day celebration with alternating days of presents and complete family silence for dads. He acknowledges the absurdity of the idea while playfully advocating for greater recognition of fathers. Gaffigan envisions "Father's Day Month" as an "off-and-on holiday" with specific rules and conditions. The commentary is a lighthearted take on the appreciation of fathers, with Gaffigan noting that he truly cherishes Mother's Day as it ushers in the time to celebrate dads.</p>
