          <p>Carnival shares experienced a surge of nearly 7% following the release of better-than-expected second-quarter results and an upward revision of the company's full-year guidance. The cruise operator reported adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share, exceeding analysts' estimates, with adjusted revenue reaching a record $6.3 billion. Net income saw a substantial increase to $565 million, up from $92 million the previous year. CEO Josh Weinstein highlighted the strong momentum across all of Carnival's brands, leading to an increased forecast for adjusted net income, now expected to be 40% higher than 2024, and adjusted EBITDA projected at $6.9 billion. The company is also preparing for the opening of Celebration Key in the Bahamas, which is expected to further boost demand. </p>

          <p>Two four-year-old bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and raided the food store, consuming a week's supply of honey before falling asleep. The wildlife park reported that the bears posed no threat to the public, though visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure, and police were called to the scene while an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the escape. The park attributed the incident to an "operational error" and assured the public that measures would be taken to prevent future occurrences. </p>

          <p>A 55-year-old hiker from Texas was rescued from Mount Washington in New Hampshire after suffering from hypothermia, highlighting the stark contrast between the East Coast heat wave and the mountain's frigid conditions. The hiker, Caroline Wilson, was found unresponsive on the Gulfside Trail, prompting a rescue operation involving conservation officers and volunteers. Despite cities experiencing sweltering heat, the summit of Mount Washington saw temperatures around 20 degrees Fahrenheit with high winds and dense cloud cover. Wilson's condition was exacerbated by wearing cotton base layers, which are not ideal for hiking due to their absorbent nature. The rescue team successfully stabilized and transported her to a local hospital, underscoring the unpredictable and potentially life-threatening conditions in the White Mountains. </p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, marking his first absence from the gathering of leading emerging economies. Citing a scheduling conflict, Beijing informed the Brazilian government that Premier Li Qiang will lead the Chinese delegation instead. Sources suggest that Xi's recent meetings with Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva factored into the decision. Xi has previously participated in all BRICS summits, including virtually during the coronavirus pandemic, making this absence a notable departure. The change in leadership may reflect shifting priorities within the Chinese government. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China closely monitors the conflict between Israel and Iran due to its status as the largest importer of Iranian oil and a political partner of Tehran. Iran exports approximately 90% of its crude oil to China, despite U.S. sanctions, which China purchases at a discounted rate. This trade relationship has fostered a close partnership between the two countries, with China evacuating thousands of its citizens from Iran following recent strikes. China's reliance on Iranian oil and its political ties contribute to its vested interest in the region's stability. </p>

This launch follows a similar service in Austin, Texas, and marks a significant step in the expansion of autonomous transportation. Waymo's robotaxis operate without human supervisors and utilize advanced lidar and radar sensors, distinguishing them from Tesla's approach.

          <p>A comparison of a $10,000 one-year CD and a $10,000 high-yield savings account reveals that the CD would earn more interest due to its fixed interest rate. The one-year CD at 4.45% would earn $445, while the high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn $430, assuming the rate remains constant. With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, the CD offers a guaranteed return, making it a more attractive option for savers seeking stability. Money market accounts are presented as an alternative but carry the same variable rate risks as high-yield savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

While the increase was anticipated, officials do not expect congestion at the ports due to recent softness in container traffic. The increase in containers will be a boost for trucking, railroads and warehouse companies who get paid by the freight load. </p>
