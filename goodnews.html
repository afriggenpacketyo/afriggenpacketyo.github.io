        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to increase their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion. The deal significantly reduces or eliminates tariffs on 92% of UK exports and 99% of Indian exports, covering goods like textiles, automobiles, and alcohol. This agreement is seen as a strategic victory for both nations, providing India with better access to the UK market and potentially giving both countries leverage in other international trade negotiations. The pact now awaits ratification by the parliaments of both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a UK first, the Welsh government will provide people with conditions like celiac disease with preloaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the existing prescription model, aiming to give individuals more choice and de-medicalize the process. The move addresses the significant extra cost of gluten-free products, with a Coeliac UK report noting they add about 35% to food bills. While the amount on the card will vary, the initiative is intended to be cost-neutral for the NHS.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team is preparing to face Australia in Melbourne, with an opportunity to win the series by taking a 2-0 lead. A victory would mark the first time the Lions have won the first two tests of a series in 28 years. Despite being strong favorites, the team is focused on maintaining intensity, especially after a dip in performance in the latter part of their first-test win. The match is set to take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of an anticipated crowd of 90,000 fans.</p>

          <p>Following a push from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again movement, the U.S. food industry is phasing out artificial dyes, with a recent pledge from the dairy industry to remove them from ice cream by 2028. Kennedy has targeted these additives, claiming they contribute to health issues, a concern echoed by some scientific research linking dyes to hyperactivity in a small percentage of children. While public health advocates generally support the move, food manufacturers face challenges in switching to less stable and potentially scarcer natural colorants, and some worry American consumers may reject the duller hues.</p>

          <p>Former USC quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart is partnering with Abbott for the "We Give Blood Drive" campaign to address critical blood shortages in the United States. Leinart shared that the cause is personal, as his late mother required blood transfusions during her battle with cancer, and friends have had children who needed them for severe illnesses. The campaign highlights that a single donation can save up to three lives and includes a competition among Big Ten Conference schools to encourage donations, with the winning school receiving $1 million for health initiatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a dramatic and historic drop in its murder rate, which fell by about 12% in 2023 and is projected to decline by roughly 20% in 2025. This rapid decrease follows a spike in violent crime during the pandemic. Analysts suggest a combination of factors may be responsible, including a massive influx of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. In cities like Baltimore, this funding supported "focused deterrence" programs offering services to high-risk individuals and improving neighborhood infrastructure, which may have contributed to the city seeing its fewest homicides in five decades.</p>

          <p>An appeals court in Argentina has ordered Google to pay the equivalent of $12,500 in compensation to a man who was photographed naked in his yard by a Street View camera. The man, a policeman, argued that the image, which captured him from behind over a 6.5-foot wall, violated his dignity and led to ridicule. An initial ruling was dismissed, but the appeals court found a "blatant" and "arbitrary intrusion into another's life." The judges stated that while Google blurs faces, an image of a person's entire naked body should also have been prevented.</p>

          <p>Amid rising skin cancer rates, experts are reinforcing the importance of using sunscreen while also addressing public concerns and online misinformation about product safety. Sunscreens are categorized as either organic (carbon-based) or physical (mineral-based), with both working to block harmful UVA and UVB rays. While some studies have detected certain long-approved chemicals in the bloodstream, scientists stress that the dosage is key and the benefits of preventing sun damage and skin cancer are paramount. Researchers also caution against homemade sunscreens and advise not to mix different sunscreen products, as it can diminish their effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. The deal, which transfers broadcast licenses for 28 CBS television stations, was approved with a 2-1 vote. FCC head Brendan Carr stated that Skydance made commitments to "unbiased journalism" and to ending diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The approval came shortly after Paramount settled a legal dispute with President Donald Trump and announced the end of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," though the network cited financial reasons for the cancellation.</p>

          <p>A Maui County Council committee has passed a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals in apartment-zoned areas, aiming to increase the island's long-term housing supply. The move is a response to a severe housing crisis exacerbated by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire. If enacted, the legislation would convert over 6,000 units to long-term housing, a number equivalent to a decade of new construction. Proponents argue it is a critical step for local residents, while opponents predict it will harm small businesses and question whether the converted condos will be affordable for locals.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly considering a move for RB Leipzig's Slovenian striker, Benjamin Sesko, as a potential replacement if their star forward, Alexander Isak, leaves the club.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A statistical analysis indicates that the significant home-field advantage historically present in Major League Soccer is diminishing, bringing the league's home-win percentage in line with top European leagues. In its early years, factors like vast travel distances, varied playing surfaces, and potential officiating bias contributed to home teams winning around 60% of the time. Now, that figure has dropped into the mid-40s, reflecting the league's growing maturity. This shift is attributed to improved travel logistics, the implementation of VAR reducing referee bias, and more sophisticated tactical approaches from visiting teams, signaling a more balanced and competitive league.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago found that while people report enjoying interactions with extroverted robots more, they find neurotic robots to be more human-like and relatable. In an experiment, participants interacted with a robot programmed with different personalities, including extroverted, neurotic, and a bland, typical robot persona. The neurotic robot, which spoke tentatively and expressed worries, was often described as being more emotionally deep and understandable. This research challenges the prevailing focus on creating exclusively confident and outgoing robots, suggesting that expressing vulnerability could make them more relatable in certain contexts.</p>

The policy, supported by the school board, was challenged by the California Charter Schools Association, which argued it illegally denied students access to public school facilities. The ruling is a major victory for charter schools, affirming their right under state law to reasonably equivalent facilities. The district, while disappointed, noted that portions of the policy related to safety and capacity were upheld and has not yet decided whether to appeal.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "There’s No Going Back," explores the career of Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme, who passed away in 2017. The book, by David M. Stewart, traces Demme's path from B-movie producer to acclaimed director of films like "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia." The review finds the biography to be uneven, praising its detail on Demme's lifelong activism and his focus on marginalized characters but criticizing its inconsistent analysis of his films. While it highlights his passion for music and female protagonists, the book ultimately struggles to synthesize the director's life and art into a cohesive thematic overview.</p>
