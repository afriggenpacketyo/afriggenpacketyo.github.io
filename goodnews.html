        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While sales in the specialist watchmakers segment declined, overall sales rose annually across all regions except Asia Pacific, where China experienced a significant drop. Richemont's Chairman Johann Rupert noted that ongoing global uncertainties require agility and discipline, with analysts pointing to gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations as potential headwinds. The company's pricing power, however, could offset some of these challenges.</p>

          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features aimed at young users, amidst growing criticism and lawsuits alleging harm to users' mental health. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" for users under 18, interrupting their "For You" feed with meditation prompts. This initiative comes as TikTok faces increasing public pressure and legal challenges concerning the platform's impact on young users, including allegations of being intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study, published in Science, reveals that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. It also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This research could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out about the need for regulation in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly regarding the use of her likeness and voice by AI companies. She recounted an experience where OpenAI's Chatbot feature, "Sky," sounded eerily similar to her voice, despite her declining an offer to voice the AI. Johansson's legal team took action, and the company later agreed to take down "Sky." She emphasizes the importance of establishing boundaries to prevent exploitation and protect individuals from unauthorized use of their identity.</p>

The number of billionaires in the UK has decreased from 165 to 156, marking the sharpest decline in the list's history. The King's rise in wealth makes him richer than his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, with the majority of his fortune benefiting from her investment portfolio.</p>

          <p>Japan saw record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors fled U.S. markets following President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts suggest that Trump's tariff policies changed global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading to diversification into markets like Japan. Japanese assets are generally considered a haven, whose appeal rose as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground in April.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to legally monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will require operators of key infrastructure, such as those in the electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. This move reflects the country's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations.</p>
