          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued an emergency order preventing the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The ruling came after lawyers discovered that children were being placed on planes in Texas for imminent removal, circumventing legal protections that allow them to seek humanitarian relief. The judge's temporary restraining order, described as "extraordinary," was justified by the government's hurried actions over a holiday weekend. Administration lawyers argued it was a repatriation effort to reunite children with families, a claim disputed by the minors' attorneys who cited U.S. law protecting them from such speedy removals.</p>

          <p>Representative James Comer, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has formally requested Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell from the Treasury Department. The request is part of the committee's broader investigation into potential mismanagement of the federal government's inquiry into Epstein's sex trafficking network and his subsequent death. This action follows the establishment of a task force to declassify federal secrets and the issuance of deposition subpoenas to high-profile figures, including former government officials. The committee aims to use the financial records to further its oversight of federal law enforcement's handling of the case.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a revered CBS News correspondent known as the unofficial historian of the White House press corps, has passed away at 73. For decades, he meticulously documented the daily activities of U.S. presidents, creating an invaluable and single-handedly maintained archive of presidential travel, speeches, and actions. Knoller generously shared his detailed records with colleagues, historians, and even White House aides, believing the information belonged to the public. After a long and distinguished career in radio, he later reinvented himself as a prolific presence on Twitter (now X), sharing his unique insights and data with a large online audience until his departure from CBS in 2020.</p>

Zirinsky recounted how she persuaded Knoller to join CBS News, where he became the unofficial record-keeper of the presidency, obsessively logging every detail of presidential activities. His encyclopedic knowledge was so trusted that even the White House would consult him for statistics. Colleagues remembered him not only for his unparalleled journalistic dedication but also for his kindness, humor, and generosity in sharing his vast repository of information, cementing his status as a Washington institution.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay, the renowned celebrity chef, announced that he recently had a basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, removed from the side of his face. He shared photos on social media showing a bandage and stitches, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health issue to advocate for safety; he previously highlighted the importance of wearing a helmet after a serious bicycle accident. Dermatologists note that basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer but has a very high cure rate with early detection and treatment, reinforcing the importance of preventative measures.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, recorded his second hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The impressive shot occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass, where he aced the 177-yard hole. This marks his second ace within a year, with the first coming at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. The young golfer is steadily building his own legacy in the sport, gradually closing the gap on his father's record of 10 career holes-in-one.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export agreement by value, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This partnership will create a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates, significantly bolstering NATO's capabilities in the North Atlantic. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a move that drives economic growth and enhances national security for both nations and the broader alliance.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, several players won smaller amounts, including four tickets sold in Massachusetts that won prizes of $1 million and $50,000. The upcoming Monday drawing will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won on May 31. This jackpot is now the largest since a $1.326 billion prize was claimed in Oregon in April 2024, continuing to attract widespread attention as it approaches record levels.</p>

          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins. Led by the non-profit Bay Foundation, divers armed with hammers have cleared over 80 acres of seafloor, allowing the once-decimated giant kelp forests to rebound. These underwater ecosystems, crucial for carbon storage and marine biodiversity, had declined by 80% due to a combination of factors, including the proliferation of the kelp-devouring urchins. The project is now being viewed as a potential model for restoring vital kelp habitats in other parts of the world.</p>

Dončić also became the youngest player to score 400 career points in the tournament since Tony Parker in 2007, further cementing his status as one of the sport's elite international players.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at the Dutch Grand Prix, extending his championship lead in a race filled with incidents.

The dramatic failure could be a decisive moment in the title fight between the two McLaren drivers. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar claimed his first-ever podium finish for Racing Bulls, capitalizing on the chaotic final laps of the race.</p>
