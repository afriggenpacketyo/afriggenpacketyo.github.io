          <p>Following a series of postponements, Shakira delivered a high-energy spectacle at her Los Angeles concert, part of her "Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran" tour. The performance was characterized by elaborate production, frequent costume changes, and impressive choreography, though some critics noted sound quality issues within the SoFi stadium. The show heavily featured her recent commercial hits centered on themes of female empowerment following her public separation, with only a few nods to her earlier rock-influenced music. The article highlights her focus on entertainment spectacle over political or social commentary, despite the concert's initial delay being linked to local security concerns.</p>

          <p>Mining and commodity trading giant Glencore has concluded a review of its stock market listing, deciding to remain on the London Stock Exchange rather than move to New York. The company stated that a shift would not be value-accretive for shareholders at this time, providing a significant boost to the London market, which has recently lost other major firms. This decision was announced alongside its half-year results, which revealed a net loss of $655 million amid lower commodity prices and U.S. tariff uncertainty. Glencore also launched a $1 billion cost-cutting program to improve its financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported a 67% surge in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, reaching 19.53 billion Danish kroner. Despite this strong growth, the figure fell slightly below analyst expectations, and the company's stock saw a minor dip. Novo Nordisk reiterated its full-year outlook but has been contending with softer U.S. sales due to competition and pressure from the White House to lower drug prices. The company also announced cost-cutting measures and a leadership change to sharpen its commercial execution amid these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by JPMorgan, HSBC is expected to maintain the highest dividend yield among banks in the Greater China region, projecting shareholder returns between 9% and 11% for the year. The investment bank raised its price target for HSBC shares, citing the bank's strong capital position and shareholder return programs, including a recent US$3 billion stock buyback. JPMorgan noted that HSBC's dividend payments are unlikely to be affected by any potential impairment on its stake in China's Bank of Communications (Bocom). This positive outlook positions HSBC as a strong performer in the regional banking sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant strategy shift, OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b. This marks the company's return to open-source development, a move widely seen as a direct challenge to the growing number of popular open-source models emerging from China, such as Alibaba's Qwen family. CEO Sam Altman described the new models as the "best and most usable" in the world, with performance comparable to some of the company's smaller proprietary models. The release intensifies competition in the global AI landscape, particularly in the open-source community.</p>

          <p>China's campaign to resolve local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a list of 12 high-risk provincial-level jurisdictions. The achievement was revealed in a local budget review, signaling progress in Beijing's efforts to control financial risks. Inner Mongolia, a key region for coal and energy, had previously been forced to halt major infrastructure projects due to its debt burden. The central government's directive, issued in September 2023, aims to restructure debt and curb unsustainable borrowing practices by local financing vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent decision by Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his pursuit of an NFL career highlights the immense difficulty crossover athletes face in making the transition, particularly from rugby. Experts point to several major obstacles, including the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar exam. Another key factor is the sheer depth of athletic talent in American football's "skill positions," where hundreds of players possess similar speed and athleticism. Unlike linemen, where unique size is a premium, skill players must quickly develop a high "football IQ" to compete.</p>

          <p>China is actively strengthening its coffee supply chains from top African producing nations like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to meet soaring domestic demand. This strategic push is facilitated by zero-tariff policies for many African imports and is being spearheaded by rapidly expanding Chinese coffee chains such as Cotti Coffee. The move is seen by analysts as an effort to "lock in supply" amid global trade uncertainties. Cotti Coffee has already signed agreements to invest in coffee development and procure thousands of tons of beans, creating new economic opportunities for African growers.</p>
