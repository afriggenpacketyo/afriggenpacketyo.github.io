          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for April 2027, may feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel stated he laid out three conditions for the finale, including bringing the franchise back to its Los Angeles street-racing roots and reuniting the iconic duo of Dom and Brian. Walker passed away in 2013, and his last appearance in "Furious 7" was completed using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins, sparking debate about posthumous digital performances.</p>

          <p>A controversial proposal to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land across 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a Republican tax and spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from at least four Republican senators and five House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he pulled the provision due to an inability to guarantee the land would only be sold to American families and not foreign interests. Conservationists celebrated the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands.</p>

          <p>A debate continues over the health impacts of common seed oils like canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, fueled by claims from figures such as Health Secretary RFK Jr. that they are harmful to Americans. These oils are prevalent in processed foods and are a major source of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid. While some wellness influencers advocate for avoiding them, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations maintain that the evidence does not support these negative claims. They argue that when consumed as part of a balanced diet, these oils can be a healthy source of unsaturated fats.</p>

          <p>Insiders at chipmaker Nvidia, including CEO Jensen Huang, have sold more than $1 billion of the company's stock in the past year, with approximately half of that amount being sold in the last month. The sales coincide with the stock reaching new record highs and the company briefly becoming the most valuable in the world. Huang's recent sales are part of a pre-disclosed plan to sell up to 6 million shares. The significant offloading by executives has been noted by market analysts as the share price surged.
