          <p>TJX, the parent company of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, causing its stock to rise over 5%.

Consequently, TJX raised its full-year guidance for both earnings per share and comparable sales growth. CEO Ernie Herrman expressed strong confidence for the second half of the year, noting that the third quarter has already begun with positive momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart surged by over 12% after the company announced a nearly 400% increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. The impressive growth was largely driven by the global popularity of its Labubu dolls, which have gained a celebrity following. The company's revenue more than tripled, with significant sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. Despite the strong performance, some analysts express caution about the long-term sustainability of the brand's popularity and potential regulatory scrutiny over its "blind box" sales model.

This upgrade aims to help teams filter vast amounts of information more efficiently between plays, without the AI making decisions itself.

Despite a late collapse that saw them lose four wickets for nine runs, a dropped catch on the penultimate ball allowed the Brave to complete the winning runs. The loss highlighted Welsh Fire's continued struggles with their batting performance, while the Brave remain on track for the tournament's knockout stages.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey indicates that respondents believe Donald Trump is most likely to nominate his former top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, as the next Federal Reserve chair. However, when asked who the president *should* pick, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh was the top choice, with Hassett ranking fourth. The survey highlights concerns about the Fed's independence under a potential Hassett leadership, given Trump's vocal pressure for lower interest rates. Respondents also anticipate two rate cuts this year despite persistent inflation, creating a challenging environment for monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is actively improving its relationships with China and Russia, a move that coincides with growing trade friction with the United States under the Trump administration. Following a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the two nations agreed to resume direct flights and boost trade. Simultaneously, India's foreign minister visited Moscow to reinforce their strategic partnership, and Russian officials confirmed that oil supplies to India will continue. Analysts suggest India is balancing its geopolitical alliances to protect its strategic autonomy amid global uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) present a secure way to combat inflation, with many accounts offering returns that exceed the current inflation rate. While national average CD yields are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some 1-year CDs offering yields around 4.30% APY. Currently, due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs often provide better rates than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs—investing in multiple CDs with varying terms—to take advantage of high short-term rates while also planning for long-term savings goals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low at 0.38%, high-yield savings accounts offer a much more effective way to grow emergency funds. Top high-yield accounts, primarily offered by online banks, feature rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, allowing savings to grow significantly faster through compounding interest. Online banks can offer these superior rates due to lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Financial planners emphasize the importance of having an accessible emergency fund and recommend comparing different high-yield options to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new tax law signed by President Donald Trump has broadened the scope of qualifying expenses for 529 college savings plans, yet a recent survey shows few parents are utilizing them. The law now permits 529 funds to be used for vocational programs, professional licensing, continuing education, and expanded K-12 costs like tutoring and test prep. Despite the tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits, only 10% of parents use these plans, with most opting for traditional low-yield savings accounts. The law also introduces "Trump accounts," a new investment vehicle for children, set to launch with a pilot program in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The series, titled "The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox," aims to provide Knox's perspective on the ordeal that saw her imprisoned for four years before her final exoneration. Lewinsky, now an anti-bullying activist, connected with Knox over their shared experiences of being vilified by the media. The project seeks to explore the human cost of their public trials and correct the narratives that have long defined them.</p>
