        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses two new theatrical productions, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and "Vanya," both featuring a single actor playing multiple roles, and their relevance to modern society's obsession with image and performance. "Dorian Gray" uses technology, including smartphones and video, to critique the superficiality of social media and the dangers of prioritizing appearance over substance. "Vanya," on the other hand, takes a more analog approach, suggesting that exploring multiple facets of oneself can lead to a richer understanding of identity. The article poses the question of when performing a persona becomes a perversion of truth versus a manifestation of self-expression.</p>

          <p>This article presents the poem "Good Lord, These Muscadines" by Caki Wilkinson. The poem reflects on a moment of intimacy and acceptance, using the image of muscadine grapes as a metaphor for the imperfect and sometimes messy reality of life and relationships. The speaker acknowledges their own shortcomings in expressing emotions directly, preferring subtext, but finds a sense of comfort and connection in the shared experience. The poem contrasts the initial longing with the acceptance of the present, finding beauty in the unglamorous details of everyday life.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the Australian election, where Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a landslide victory, partly fueled by anti-Trump sentiment. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was nicknamed "Temu Trump" for echoing some of the U.S. president's ideas, which resonated poorly with Australian voters. While cost-of-living issues were a primary concern, Trump's unpopularity and Dutton's perceived policy missteps contributed to the Labor Party's success, signaling a desire for sensible, centrist politics.</p>
