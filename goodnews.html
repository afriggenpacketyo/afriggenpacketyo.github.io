          <p>As President Trump visits the Middle East, the article highlights how America's dominance in A.I. chips is a key source of leverage. Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the U.A.E. are eager to invest billions in data centers but need U.S. approval to purchase American-designed chips. The Trump administration intends to use access to these chips to secure strategic bonds, potentially influencing trade talks and negotiations, with tech executives from Nvidia, OpenAI, AMD, and Alphabet expected to participate in related discussions during the trip. This marks a shift from the previous administration's approach, which was more cautious about selling A.I. technology abroad due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a preliminary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed in recent months, signaling a potential breakthrough in trade negotiations. The joint statement released by the White House indicates ongoing discussions have the potential to address economic and trade relationship concerns, leading to a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since April. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that reciprocal tariffs would be reduced by 115 percentage points for three months, lowering U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% and China's tariffs on American imports to 10%. This development has buoyed global financial markets, with stock futures soaring and commodities markets reacting positively.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK has announced its decision to fully disarm and disband, signaling the end of its 40-year insurgency against the Turkish state. The move comes after the group's imprisoned founder, Abdullah Ocalan, called for a permanent laying down of arms. A spokesperson for Turkish President Erdogan's ruling party welcomed the announcement as a significant step towards a terror-free Turkey. While the specifics of the disarmament process remain unclear, the PKK stated that Kurdish rights can now be addressed through democratic politics, urging the Turkish parliament to take a historical role in completing the process.</p>

          <p>Celebrity musicians, including Elton John and Dua Lipa, are advocating for changes to the U.K.'s proposed copyright laws that would allow AI developers to access rights-protected content. An open letter urges Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support an amendment requiring AI labs to disclose which copyrighted works are used to train AI models. The current proposals would place the onus on artists to opt out of having their data scraped by large language models, which the creative industries argue amounts to giving away valuable work. The musicians argue that the U.K. risks losing an immense growth opportunity if it allows powerful overseas tech companies to freely use their content.</p>

At the same time, the government aims to expand eligibility for the "high potential individual" visa and schemes for research interns.

Research suggests that strength-based parenting correlates with lower stress levels and higher engagement in school, while focusing on fixing weaknesses can negatively affect a child's confidence. Parents are encouraged to identify their child's areas of ability, name them, build on them, and use them to address weaknesses. The article highlights the power of positive family narratives and the importance of authentic praise in fostering a positive sense of self.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce import tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, easing trade tensions and triggering a rally in global financial markets. The US will cut its tariffs on Chinese goods from as high as 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. This pause follows high-stakes negotiations in Geneva and aims to allow further discussions to resolve the trade war. While the move is seen as positive, analysts caution that the road ahead remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The White House is in talks with the royal family of Qatar regarding the potential transfer of a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One. While Qatar denies the plane is a gift, they confirm discussions about a transfer for "temporary use" between the two countries' defense ministries. The plane, valued at approximately $400 million, would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials. The potential value of the plane and its handling have raised legal and ethical questions, with Democrats accusing Trump of ethics violations.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs they have imposed on each other while working to resolve their trade war. The countries will suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. This deal breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between the two countries to a halt. The agreement also includes discussions on U.S. demands for China to crack down on the trafficking of chemical ingredients used to make fentanyl.</p>

Despite Mathurin's absence, the Pacers established a commanding 41-point halftime lead and defeated the Cavaliers 129-109, taking a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinal series. The Cavaliers were further hampered by Donovan Mitchell's ankle injury, which sidelined him for the second half. The Pacers now have the opportunity to close out the series in Cleveland.</p>
