          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a roughly 5% climb following a $152 billion drop in market capitalization fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest Tesla's investor base remains unconcerned by the drama, while others speculated on a potential truce brokered by Trump, which a White House official denied interest in. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures. The market may be volatile as it responds to the news, but some analysts believe that the stock is oversold. (not investment advice)</p>

The author notes Musk's limited understanding of government functions and the challenges of passing legislation, while also pointing out his contributions in identifying government waste and fraud. The author suggests that Musk's xAI will be crucial in providing balance in an AI-informed world and encourages Trump to rebuild his relationship with Musk for the benefit of the country's technology and space industries. The author believes that both men benefited from their partnership and that the rift must heal.</p>

          <p>The stock market's reliance on the strength of the job market is underscored by Friday's rally, which followed a reversal lower sparked by the Trump-Musk feud. The S&P 500 rebounded due to a positive nonfarm payrolls report, indicating the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2% and hourly wages up 3.9%. This report eased investor concerns following suboptimal labor market reports, suggesting the labor market didn't collapse last month. Sustained low unemployment and average hourly earnings outpacing inflation suggest a rebound in consumer buying power, benefiting companies with strong execution and services.

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed stringent new capital regulations that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures would also necessitate UBS to fully capitalize its foreign units and potentially reduce share buybacks. UBS shares jumped 6% following the announcement, with the bank stating that while it supports most of the regulatory proposals, it strongly disagrees with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements. The bank will engage in consultations and evaluate measures to address the potential negative effects on its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices eased slightly in May from April's high, as consumers who feared tariff-related price increases made purchases, according to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. The index decreased 1.5% from April to May but remained 4% higher than a year earlier, with April's level being the highest since October 2023. Retail prices have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices, and while tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand affect the used car market. Demand has stayed relatively strong due to low inventory levels, and consumers have been holding onto their vehicles longer.</p>

          <p>Centrus Energy, the only publicly traded uranium enricher in the world, aims to break the grip that foreign state corporations have on U.S. nuclear fuel. The CEO stated that the country is heavily dependent on foreign suppliers for its fuel, and that if the nuclear industry is to expand, a tremendous amount of enrichment capacity must be added. The U.S. relied on foreign countries for around 70% of its reactor fuel in 2023, and is facing a looming nuclear fuel supply gap due to the loss of Russian uranium. Centrus believes the market needs another enricher and more competition. (not investment advice)</p>
