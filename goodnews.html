          <p>Germany plans to tighten border checks with additional police officers as soon as the new coalition government takes office. Incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced stricter measures, including increased entry denials, to reduce illegal migration. Dobrindt emphasized the need for control, clarity, and consistency in managing migration. He received support from regional interior ministers, who promised even tighter border checks. The coalition agreement includes turning away asylum seekers from German borders in coordination with European neighbors, a policy that could conflict with European asylum law.</p>
