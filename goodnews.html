          <p>Shares of Canada Goose soared nearly 30% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, though it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty.

The article reports that the company's revenue increased by 7.4% compared to the same period last year.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the GOP's resistance to Chinese investment in the U.S., particularly in advanced manufacturing like battery production, is misguided. The article reports that companies like Gotion and CATL are building plants in the U.S., creating jobs and transferring technology. The author contends that embracing this investment aligns with President Trump's goal of bringing manufacturing back to America. The author suggests that the GOP's focus on national security concerns overlooks the economic benefits of these ventures and the potential for defusing tensions with China.</p>

The article reports that the bill, which has bipartisan support, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, but it may not benefit the lowest-income tipped workers who already don't pay federal income tax. Some experts warn that the policy could create issues such as misclassification of income and a shift in compensation toward greater reliance on tips.</p>
