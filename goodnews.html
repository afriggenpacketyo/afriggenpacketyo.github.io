        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test match at Edgbaston, India has taken a commanding lead over England, largely due to a monumental score of 269 by captain Shubman Gill. His performance anchored India's first innings total of 587, the highest score by an Indian captain anywhere in the world. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled significantly, collapsing to 77-3 by the close of the second day's play. Facing a substantial deficit, England now requires an exceptional and unlikely turnaround to avoid defeat and prevent India from leveling the series in a dominant fashion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a holiday-shortened week with record-breaking performance, as both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time highs. This bullish momentum was largely fueled by the technology sector, with chipmaker Nvidia's market value soaring past $3.9 trillion. The market's strength represents a significant rebound from a volatile second quarter, further bolstered by positive news such as major banks increasing their dividends following favorable stress test results. Despite a strong jobs report potentially delaying Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, overall market sentiment remains highly optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronomers have identified a new comet, named 3I/ATLAS, which originated from outside our solar system and is currently passing through. This marks only the third time such an interstellar visitor has been detected, offering scientists a rare opportunity to study material from another star system. The comet was spotted by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles away, posing no threat to Earth. Researchers are racing to observe the object before it becomes obscured by the sun, anticipating more such discoveries with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>

The companies are now resuming sales and support to their Chinese customers.

Speaking on a podcast, Cuban suggested this individual might not be a corporate giant but could be a single person who masterfully harnesses AI's potential in a novel way. He compared the current state of AI to the early days of the internet and smartphones, asserting that its full capabilities are yet to be seen.

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision is whether to use federal or private student loans. Federal undergraduate loans for the upcoming year will have a fixed rate of 6.39%, offering accessibility to all borrowers regardless of credit history and providing key protections like forgiveness programs. However, private lenders are currently advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer, potentially offering substantial savings. While federal loans are a safe starting point, families with strong credit profiles should compare private options to potentially secure a lower overall borrowing cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to further scale back the Right to Buy scheme in England to protect social housing stock. Under the new proposals, newly-built social homes will be exempt from the policy for 35 years, a significant increase to ensure councils can recover building costs. Additionally, tenants will now need to live in their properties for at least ten years, up from three, to qualify for the scheme. The maximum purchase discounts will also be significantly reduced. The Conservative opposition criticized the move as an "attack on aspiration," while housing associations welcomed the changes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' expectations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate also edged down to 4.1% from 4.2% in May. Job growth was notable in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. This strong performance comes amid economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's ongoing trade disputes and tariffs. The White House has sought to blame the Federal Reserve for any economic headwinds, while the Fed has cited tariff policies as a reason for holding interest rates steady.</p>
