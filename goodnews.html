          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that the presence of *Bifidobacterium longum* in newborns halved the risk of hospitalization for lung infections in the first two years of life. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health outcomes. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery. The optimism score reflects the potential for new therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it's unknown whether the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely. The optimism score reflects the importance of informed decision-making regarding medication during pregnancy.</p>
