          <p>Shares of eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform, experienced a significant surge of 40% during their Nasdaq debut after successfully raising nearly $310 million in its IPO, pricing shares above the anticipated range. This IPO is being closely watched by Wall Street as a potential indicator of renewed interest in IPOs after a prolonged period of slowdown. EToro's revenue from cryptoassets has seen substantial growth, contributing significantly to its trading income. The company had previously shelved plans to go public via a SPAC merger in 2022 due to unfavorable market conditions.</p>

          <p>A judge in Virginia has ordered the immediate release of Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen and postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, who was detained by immigration officials for two months. Suri was arrested in March, with the government claiming he violated the terms of his academic visa. The ACLU released a video of his arrest, which closely resembled the detentions of other pro-Palestinian activists. Suri's lawyers argued that he was targeted due to his marriage to a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent, who has been scrutinized for her family's ties to Hamas.</p>

Senator Bernie Moreno introduced the Larry Henderson Act, which would require those found guilty of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer to serve at least a 20-year sentence.</p>

A recent agreement with China would reduce U.S. taxes on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%, while China will cut tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. A trade agreement with the United Kingdom will cut tariffs on U.K. cars and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum.

          <h2>DOGE Cancels Thousands of Federal Contracts, Grants, and Leases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 11:56:48 EDT</div>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under Elon Musk, has been publishing a list of canceled contracts, grants, and leases on its website. DOGE calculates savings by subtracting the total obligated amount from the total potential value of a contract. However, there have been criticisms of DOGE's accounting methods, with some claiming that the savings are far lower than what is being reported. Despite touting massive budget cuts, a CBS News analysis found that the Trump administration actually spent more in its first 100 days than over the same period last year.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Racks Gain Momentum in April</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 11:52:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia (NVDA) stock increased after Morgan Stanley reported encouraging April numbers from Taiwan's ODMs, with approximately 1,500 GB200 racks shipped across three major builders, aligning with forecasts. GB200 is Nvidia's next-generation Hopper GPU gear, and the number of racks shipped indicates enterprise AI demand and improved supply. Morgan Stanley anticipates shipments could increase further as factories ramp up, mitigating concerns about low volumes and unwanted inventory. Additionally, industry checks suggest strong demand from cloud players like CoreWeave and xAI.</p>
