          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a massive £5.5 billion ($7.4 billion) bitcoin scam, considered the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scheme that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China, converting the stolen funds into bitcoin assets. Her guilty plea concludes a seven-year international investigation into a complex money laundering operation. Authorities are now working to ensure the stolen funds are returned to the victims, many of whom have already received compensation through a Chinese scheme.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the international unit of China's largest mined gold producer, saw its shares surge over 60% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The company had raised nearly HKD$25 billion (approximately $3.2 billion) with its initial public offering, making it the world's second-largest IPO this year. This successful listing occurs amidst record-high spot gold prices, driven by strong safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainty. The IPO signals a resurgence in Hong Kong's market and strengthens Zijin Mining's focus on its global gold operations, expanding its presence in the gold value chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong could serve as China's primary hub for engagement with the United Nations, bolstering Beijing's global governance vision. The article highlights Hong Kong's unique attributes, including its official use of English, common law system, and low corporate taxes, as ideal for facilitating international interactions. Positioning the UN's Asia headquarters in Hong Kong could enhance the organization's reforms and leverage the city's robust legal traditions. This strategic move would reinforce Hong Kong's international role and support China's significant financial contributions to the UN.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). The judge cited "concerning disrespect" from the administration regarding previous orders to restore VOA programming, which aims to provide reliable news globally. The proposed job cuts, which would affect the vast majority of USAGM staff, were seen as significantly undermining the agency's statutory mission. This ruling preserves the agency's current operations and ensures its ability to function while legal challenges against the administration's actions continue.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's long-awaited Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is nearing inauguration, aiming to alleviate congestion at the existing overworked airport and establish Mumbai as a global aviation hub. Spread over 1,100 hectares and connected by India's longest sea-bridge, NMIA is designed to eventually handle 90 million passengers annually. While promising significant capacity relief and advanced digital features, the airport faces major challenges, particularly regarding its distance from the city and inadequate last-mile connectivity. Experts caution that without improved transport links and revised aviation policies, NMIA's ambition to rival hubs like Singapore and Dubai may be hindered.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes an impending government shutdown will not significantly impact the stock market, citing historical trends where markets have often performed well during such periods. He distinguishes a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, noting the U.S. can still pay bondholders. Cramer's primary concern is that a shutdown could delay the release of crucial economic data, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. While acknowledging the severe impact on furloughed federal workers and potential GDP reduction, he suggests that delayed data collection, though inconvenient, is not a reason for major market concern.
