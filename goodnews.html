          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and pressure from allies, Germany is amending its constitution to dramatically increase defense spending. The plan aims to raise its military budget to 3.5% of GDP, making its armed forces the largest in Europe. This move will fund a massive overhaul of the beleaguered Bundeswehr, boosting the domestic defense industry like drone-maker Quantum Systems. However, the article notes that rebuilding a strong military culture and recruiting personnel will be a generational challenge.</p>
