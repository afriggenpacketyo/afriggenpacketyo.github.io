          <h2>Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Have Originated in Tang Dynasty China</h2>

          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian in Tang dynasty China over a thousand years ago. The research, published in the journal *Antiquity*, combines stylistic analysis and lead isotope testing to support its claim. The analysis points to similarities with mythical Chinese *zhenmushou* beasts and indicates the copper used matches ore from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. Researchers speculate the statue could have been transported to Venice by the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old staunch conservative, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish security stance, desire to revise Japan's pacifist constitution, and opposition to progressive social policies like same-sex marriage. Her election comes after the LDP suffered significant election defeats, and she now faces the challenge of uniting a fractured party while navigating a sluggish economy.

This year's Harvest Moon, the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, is unusually late. It will be the first of three back-to-back supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December.</p>
