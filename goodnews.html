          <h2>Psychologist Highlights the Most Damaging Phrase in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 12:50:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [someone else]?" as highly detrimental to relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex-partner, friend, or even a past version of the current partner, communicates that the person is not enough. The article suggests that such comparisons stem from a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. Instead of making comparisons, the article suggests that couples should communicate their needs directly and clearly to foster a healthier and more secure relationship environment, which is crucial for long-term happiness and fulfillment.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China due to the current high levies impeding business between the two nations.

Trump noted economic challenges in China, including a contraction in factory activity, suggesting that China is eager to resume trade. He emphasized that any future trade agreement must be fair, signaling a potential shift in his administration's trade strategy to alleviate economic pressures and foster renewed business engagement.</p>

Developer Monte Anderson has converted a ranch-style house into four studio apartments, highlighting a potential solution to the affordability crisis. The article discusses how changing demographics and living arrangements necessitate smaller, more affordable housing options. Cities and states are increasingly adopting policies to encourage the creation of accessory dwelling units and lot subdivisions to increase housing density without drastically altering existing neighborhoods, suggesting a pragmatic approach to easing the housing crunch.</p>
