        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is significantly increasing iPhone production in India, expanding operations with partners like Tata Group and Foxconn for new models. This strategic move aims to reduce the company's reliance on China, especially amidst ongoing trade tensions and looming trade restrictions. The expansion occurs as the U.S. pressures India over its purchases of discounted Russian oil, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accusing India of "profiteering" and President Trump hiking tariffs. Despite these geopolitical complexities, Apple's substantial $600 billion commitment to American manufacturing over four years, including a recent $2.5 billion investment in Corning, is expected to mitigate India-related tariff concerns and reinforce its commitment to U.S. economic priorities.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and its cabin crew union, CUPE, have reached a tentative agreement, ending a nearly four-day strike that stranded thousands of passengers. The airline plans to gradually resume flights starting Tuesday evening, though full operations may take about a week to stabilize, leading to continued cancellations. Key sticking points in negotiations, which resumed after the union defied a government back-to-work order, included "unpaid work" and wages, with CUPE stating the new deal means "unpaid work is over." The agreement, which still requires union member ratification, aims to achieve "transformational change" for workers and minimize further travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Fox News that the U.S. will not deploy ground troops to Ukraine, emphasizing his assurance as president and suggesting European nations like France, Germany, and the U.K. would provide "boots on the ground." He also discussed his efforts to coordinate a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating he spoke with Putin to arrange it, despite the late hour in Russia. Trump suggested that Zelenskyy and Putin should meet first, and if successful, he would then join to "wrap it up," expressing hope for flexibility from Zelenskyy. This article highlights Trump's direct involvement in seeking a negotiated peace, though specific details on Ukraine's security guarantees remain limited.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is evaluating a range of products, including a potentially more powerful AI chip for China, tentatively named the B30A and based on its Blackwell architecture, with samples possibly reaching Chinese clients next month. This development follows U.S. export controls on advanced chips, which led Nvidia and rival AMD to agree to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their China sales to resume exports. Nvidia stated all its offerings are with "full approval of the applicable authorities" and designed solely for beneficial commercial use. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick praised Nvidia's CEO, suggesting the administration is open to such sales under negotiated terms, highlighting the complex balance between commercial interests and national security.</p>

Starmer co-chaired a virtual meeting to discuss next steps, including plans for a "reassurance force" if hostilities end and further sanctions on Putin. Despite lingering anxieties about Ukraine's future, Starmer expressed satisfaction with the progress, emphasizing a "real sense of unity" among leaders and welcoming the movement towards Russia-Ukraine-US meetings. The UK government is now focused on strengthening Ukraine's position for peace negotiations, particularly regarding territorial discussions, ensuring Ukraine's agency, and securing "cast iron" security backing from allies.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose 4% after the company maintained its full-year sales and comparable sales forecast, despite missing Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue. The retailer attributes ongoing consumer "deferral mindset" for large home improvement projects to general economic uncertainty, rather than just mortgage rates. Encouraging signs include a rise in big-ticket transactions and improved year-over-year sales trends each month of the quarter. Home Depot is also expanding its professional customer base through acquisitions like SRS Distribution and GMS, aiming to diversify beyond DIY projects in a sluggish housing market.

          <p>Missing a Certificate of Deposit (CD) maturity date can be costly, as funds may automatically renew at potentially less favorable rates or terms, and early withdrawal penalties could apply. Experts advise contacting your financial institution immediately, as most offer a 7-10 day grace period for changes without penalty. If outside this window, a good relationship with the bank might help reduce or waive fees. It's crucial to review the new CD terms, compare rates, and decide whether to withdraw, renew, or reinvest funds. To prevent future issues, setting calendar reminders and ensuring contact information is current are recommended. (not investment advice)</p>
