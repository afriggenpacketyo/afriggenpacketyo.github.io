          <p>The Metropolitan Police have conducted their largest-ever operation against phone theft, targeting an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen devices from the UK to China in the last year. The investigation, which began after a victim tracked a single stolen iPhone to a warehouse, uncovered an "industrial scale" operation responsible for a large portion of London's phone thefts. Eighteen suspects have been arrested after police intercepted shipments and conducted raids. The operation highlights the lucrative black market for stolen phones, which can be sold for thousands of pounds overseas, and the growing challenge of phone-related street crime.</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo beer, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Despite the positive results, the company reiterated its previously lowered full-year guidance, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand. Net sales for the quarter dropped 15% from the previous year, and the company is navigating headwinds including aluminum tariffs and lower demand from Hispanic consumers. The reaffirmation of the cautious outlook signals ongoing uncertainty in the consumer market for the remainder of the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a student walkout at Brooklin High School, the Durham District School Board has asked three of its schools to "pause" their decision to cancel prom. The schools had initially cited growing liabilities, risks, and expectations as reasons for ending the tradition, proposing alternative year-end activities instead. Students, particularly those in the graduating class who missed their Grade 8 graduation ceremonies due to the pandemic, organized a protest to voice their disappointment. The board has now called for consultation with students and staff to explore alternatives, emphasizing the need for student voices to be heard in the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, savers are weighing whether a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is the better option for their money. This article analyzes the potential earnings for a $10,000 deposit in both, finding that returns are currently very similar over various short-term periods. However, the key difference is that a CD's rate is fixed, guaranteeing a specific return, while a high-yield savings account's variable rate is likely to fall further with anticipated future rate cuts. Savers are advised to consider a strategy that combines the security of a CD with the flexibility of a high-yield account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is becoming a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. This article calculates that a $150,000 HELOC currently costs between approximately $1,424 and $1,811 per month, depending on the repayment term, which is cheaper than in previous months. Because HELOCs have variable interest rates, their costs are expected to decrease further with anticipated future rate cuts by the Fed. While taking on a six-figure line of credit carries risks, the current economic climate makes it a potentially attractive option for those with sufficient home equity. (not investment advice)</p>
