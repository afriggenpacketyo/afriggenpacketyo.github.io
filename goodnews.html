          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting and considered tariff uncertainties. This follows a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of Donald Trump's global tariffs illegal. India's markets are under scrutiny after Trump claimed India offered to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports to zero. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi indexes saw gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index remained flat and mainland China's CSI 300 slightly declined.</p>

Sinner, who had previously dropped a set to Denis Shapovalov, needed just over an hour to defeat Bublik 6-1, 6-1, 6-1. The article notes that Bublik struggled with double faults and groundstroke errors, while Sinner's winning streak at hard-court grand slams now stands at 25 matches. Musetti also had a dominant win against Jaume Munar, ensuring the first all-Italian men's quarter-final in a grand slam.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing the need for "generational change" within the party. In an interview with The New York Times, Nadler referenced Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election as influencing his decision. Nadler, first elected in 1992, served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2023 and managed Trump's first impeachment. He was facing a primary challenge from 26-year-old Liam Elkind, who emphasized the need for a more relevant and organized party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar showed a slight recovery in early Asian trading after several days of decline, ahead of the U.S. markets reopening following the Labor Day holiday. Investors have been selling the dollar amid concerns that President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve are undermining the central bank's independence. The euro edged lower after data showed the HCOB euro zone manufacturing PMI expanded in August for the first time in three years. The Australian dollar paused after five days of gains, while the kiwi traded flat after a three-day winning streak.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has dated the Petralona cranium, an ancient human skull discovered in Greece, to at least 286,000 years old, placing it in the Middle Pleistocene era. The findings, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, used advanced uranium-series dating techniques to analyze calcite on the skull. The skull's features set it apart from both Neanderthals and modern humans, leading anthropologists to group it with Homo heidelbergensis. The study suggests that archaic populations coexisted with emerging Neanderthals in Europe.</p>
