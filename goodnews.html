          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to receive the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Germany, recognizing her role in maintaining European unity and resilience. The award ceremony will host hundreds of guests, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Von der Leyen's tenure has spanned challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and she previously served as Germany's defense minister under Angela Merkel. Despite accolades, her career has faced controversy, including scrutiny over text messages with Pfizer's CEO and questions about contract awards during her time as defense minister.</p>

Carney dismissed constitutional concerns, citing the presence of Moses in the U.S. Capitol and arguing the bill protects religious freedom against secular erosion. He envisions the law as a model for other states and a counter to violence in schools, emphasizing the commandments' value even for non-believers.

          <p>Financial markets responded favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. U.S. futures jumped, oil prices rose, and the U.S. dollar gained against the yen and euro. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not authorize the use of tariffs. The White House immediately appealed, but investors appeared encouraged after months of turmoil brought on by Trump's trade war. The ruling has injected a brief respite before the next thunderclap.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, in a major blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every one of the world's countries. The Trump administration said it would appeal within minutes of the ruling. A former top official at the CBP said there would not be any changes at the border for now and that tariffs would still have to be paid.</p>
