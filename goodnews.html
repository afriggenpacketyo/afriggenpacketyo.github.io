        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's Australian electric vehicle sales rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly a year, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. Sales of the Model Y soared by 122.5% year-over-year, offsetting a decline in Model 3 sales. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year. Globally, Tesla faces challenges from increased competition and reputational issues related to CEO Elon Musk's activities, although there have been some bright spots in Norway and Turkey.</p>

His offensive surge, with a .314 batting average and eight home runs in his last 22 games, has helped offset his defensive struggles.

The government is continuing to work with US officials to finalize the terms of the trade agreement, but uncertainty remains regarding the final tariff rates.
