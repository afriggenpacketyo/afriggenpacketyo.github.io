          <p>President Trump, in a commencement address at West Point, emphasized a foreign policy focused on peace and partnership, even with countries holding profound differences. He criticized past political leaders for misusing the military in unintended missions and asserted his commitment to core national interests. Trump touted his "Golden Age" agenda and contrasted military service with careers in business, highlighting the honor and sacrifice of the graduating cadets. He stated that the choice to serve in the military was "better" than pursuing high-paying careers on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices under the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also indicates that 44.7% believe rice prices should be reduced to below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than the one pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has seen a slight increase in the wake of these developments.</p>

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham has urged calm after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. While acknowledging that mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change, Prof Jonathan Ball stated that the public need not be overly concerned. He explained that only a small percentage of infected individuals develop severe symptoms, and no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus have been reported in the UK to date. The UK Health Security Agency is increasing surveillance in affected areas to monitor mosquito activity.</p>
