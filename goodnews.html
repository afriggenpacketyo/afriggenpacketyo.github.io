          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is furthering discussions with Cypriot leaders regarding Cyprus's potential role in the India-Middle East-Europe trade corridor, a venture intended to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative. Modi's visit to Cyprus is seen as a message to Turkey, a rival neighbor that has openly supported Pakistan over India in recent cross-border hostilities. The proposed trade link, known as the IMEC, aims to connect India with Europe via sea and railway. A memorandum of understanding was reportedly facilitated between the National Payments Corporation of India and the Eurobank of Cyprus to introduce UPI services for cross-border transactions. Optimism remains about the potential for stronger trade relations between India and Europe. </p>

          <p>Shares of French fashion house Kering experienced a 7% increase following reports that Luca de Meo, an industry outsider, has been appointed as the group's CEO. This comes as Kering, the owner of brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent, undertakes a turnaround effort. De Meo, known for his successful turnaround of Renault, brings experience in brand management and marketing. Challenges remain for the luxury sector, with Kering facing declining sales at Gucci, which constitutes nearly half of the group's revenue. Despite the challenges, the potential for brand rejuvenation and steady revenue generation offers a positive outlook for the company. </p>
