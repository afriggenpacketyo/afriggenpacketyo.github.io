          <p>The winning numbers have been announced for the Powerball jackpot, which reached an estimated $850 million, making it the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. The drawing offers a potential winner the choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $383.7 million before taxes. This substantial prize comes after a series of drawings without a jackpot winner, with the last top prize being claimed in May. Lottery officials noted that ticket sales have surged as the grand prize has grown, increasing contributions to state-funded programs.</p>

          <p>In a civil trial where rapper Cardi B is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, testimony from a receptionist and a doctor has bolstered her defense. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, is seeking $24 million, alleging the rapper scratched and spat at her outside a Beverly Hills medical office. However, the receptionist testified that she saw the guard corner the pregnant rapper and that she herself was injured by the guard. Cardi B maintains that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched the plaintiff, characterizing the lawsuit as an attempt for a financial payout.</p>

Despite holding the rate, the central bank issued a more positive economic outlook, upgrading its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2.0%. This decision reflects a cautious approach, balancing stable inflation and modest economic improvements against potential financial stability risks within the domestic property market.

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of China's central bank, has called for a cautious and multidimensional assessment of stablecoins, warning against excessive speculation and potential systemic financial risks. His comments come as countries like the U.S. and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks for these digital currencies. Zhou cautioned that the hype around stablecoins could be exploited by some firms to inflate their valuations without focusing on sustainable business models. He stressed the need to evaluate their genuine utility rather than getting caught up in a speculative frenzy that could lead to fraud and instability.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors analyzed the Bank of Korea's decision to hold its policy rate steady at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting. While South Korea's Kospi saw modest gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined. Attention is also on Asian chip stocks following Nvidia's strong earnings report, though its stock slipped in extended trading. Additionally, markets are monitoring the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Indian exports, which took effect and have increased risks to India's economic growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new NATO report, all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO's Secretary General emphasized that financial commitments must translate into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its AI hardware. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share on $46.74 billion in revenue, signaling the global AI infrastructure boom remains robust. Despite the positive overall results and a strong forecast, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion slightly missed analyst estimates. Nvidia's growth continues to be overwhelmingly powered by its sales of GPUs and related components for AI systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. The position, which helps film and TV productions navigate city bureaucracy, had been vacant since she took office, causing frustration within the entertainment industry. The appointment comes at a critical time, as Los Angeles faces a production slump and increasing competition from other locations with more generous tax incentives. Kang's role will be crucial in efforts to retain and expand filming within the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated there is a "real possibility" that the company could bring its advanced Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market. His comments came as he urged the U.S. government to allow American tech companies to compete globally in the AI sector. This follows a deal where Nvidia secured licenses to sell its less advanced H20 chip to China. Huang argues that providing U.S. technology is preferable to forcing Chinese firms to develop their own, which could accelerate homegrown competition and undermine the American tech stack as a global standard.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan in England, offering 30 hours a week of funded care during term time to working parents of children aged nine months to three years. To qualify, most parents must earn above a minimum threshold but less than £100,000 annually. While the program aims to alleviate high childcare costs, concerns persist about the availability of sufficient staffing and places to meet the increased demand. Additionally, some providers charge for extras like meals and supplies, which can create a barrier for lower-income families.</p>
