          <p>Estonia has become one of the world's most advanced digital societies, offering over 90% of its government services online, from tax collection to divorce applications. The country's success is attributed to its user-friendly e-ID system, which integrates public and private services, and the "once-only principle" that streamlines data sharing between authorities. This high level of digital adoption, initiated by the 'Tiger Leap' program in the 1990s, has significantly reduced administrative costs and bureaucracy. The article contrasts Estonia's progress with other European nations like Germany, highlighting lessons in creating accessible and efficient digital infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows New Tax Law Will Provide Savings Across All Income Brackets in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center indicates that the newly signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will result in an average tax saving of about $2,900 per household in 2026. The legislation extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips. However, the benefits are disproportionately skewed towards higher earners, with the top 20% of households receiving approximately 60% of the total tax breaks. For instance, the highest-income households will see an average saving of over $12,500, while the lowest-income households will save around $150. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally agreed on its 18th sanctions package against Russia in response to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, overcoming initial hesitation from Slovakia. The new measures target Russia's financial and energy sectors, aiming to weaken its ability to finance the war. Key provisions include lowering the price cap on Russian oil exports to 15% below market value and sanctioning an additional 100 ships in Russia's shadow fleet. EU leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the move as a crucial step to increase pressure on Moscow, although the effectiveness of the oil cap is questioned without US participation.</p>

          <p>Netflix has utilized generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original series for the first time, signaling a significant shift in production methods. The technology was employed in the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts" to create a scene of a collapsing building, a task completed ten times faster and at a much lower cost than with traditional methods. While co-CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted the benefits for smaller-budget productions, the use of AI in entertainment remains controversial. The move comes as the company reports strong financial performance, with a 16% revenue increase in the last quarter.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai government has announced plans to expand its shipyards on Changxing Island, aiming to solidify China's dominance in the global shipbuilding industry. The expansion will focus on high-tech vessels, such as LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships, which are projected to constitute 80% of the facility's output. The goal is to create a world-class manufacturing hub for high-end marine equipment with an industrial scale exceeding 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion) within three years. This strategic move is intended to enhance China's technological capabilities and its role as a leader in advanced vessel development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of its 18th sanctions package against Russia, the European Union has agreed to lower the price cap on Russian crude oil exports. This measure aims to further curtail Moscow's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine. The original cap, a G7 initiative, banned access to Western shipping and insurance services for non-G7 buyers paying above $60 per barrel. While EU officials did not specify the new price level, the move signals a commitment to increasing economic pressure on Russia. The package also includes, for the first time, sanctions on a major Russian-owned refinery in India.</p>

          <p>A husband-and-wife team of archaeologists from the University of Houston has unearthed the 4th-century tomb of a founding king at the Caracol archaeological site in Belize. The tomb is believed to belong to Te' K’ab Chaak, the earliest known ruler of the major Mayan city, and is the first confirmed royal tomb found there. Inside, researchers discovered numerous artifacts, including pottery, carved bone tubes, and a jadeite mosaic death mask. The find provides invaluable insight into the ancient culture, its long-distance trade networks, and the history of the Caracol royal dynasty, which spanned approximately 30 rulers.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the heat-seeking abilities of the fire beetle, which can detect faint radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This new technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods. Infrared sensing is critical for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate smoke, fog, and dust to provide clear imaging and detection. By mimicking the beetle's specialized pit organ, scientists have created a novel optoelectronic device that could significantly advance China's defense and surveillance capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite being engaged in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the Hamas attack, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rebounded strongly, buoyed by a dynamic tech sector and significant foreign investment. The country's GDP has shown modest growth, and the OECD forecasts robust economic expansion for 2026. Analysts credit this surprising economic buoyancy to investor confidence in Israel's long-term security and the dynamism of its high-tech industry, which constitutes 20% of its GDP.
