          <p>President Donald Trump has given his "Complete and Total Endorsement" to U.S. Senator Ashley Moody of Florida ahead of a special election in 2026. Moody was appointed to the Senate seat earlier this year by Governor Ron DeSantis after it was vacated by Marco Rubio, who became Trump's Secretary of State. In his endorsement, Trump asserted that Moody would not let voters down. Moody thanked the president for his support, pledging to continue working together for a safer and stronger nation.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump stated his belief that the central bank is prepared to lower interest rates. Trump interpreted Powell's comments on the country's economic health as an indication that rate cuts would be recommended soon. This development comes after months of the president pressuring the Fed for monetary policy easing to support the economy, particularly the housing market. White House officials continue to advocate for a review of the Federal Reserve's management and policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>From ancient Minoan ritual sites to grand Baroque spectacles and modern urban cooling systems, fountains have served diverse purposes for nearly five millennia. Initially practical, they evolved into powerful symbols of divine authority, political reach, and charitable goodwill in Roman, Islamic, and Ottoman cultures. In the modern era, fountains like those at the Bellagio in Las Vegas have become iconic entertainment, choreographed with light and music. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, cities are now adapting these historic water features, using misting technology to provide public cooling, demonstrating their timeless relevance.</p>

          <p>Dr. Anna Chacon, a 39-year-old dermatologist, has become one of the few physicians licensed to practice in all 50 U.S. states, plus several territories. Inspired to create financial security after her father was laid off, she spent approximately $180,000 of her own earnings to acquire the licenses, a process she began during the pandemic to expand her telehealth practice. This investment has paid off, as she earned over $870,000 last year from her Miami-based practice and nationwide virtual consultations. Chacon also uses her unique position to provide care to underserved rural and indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>Mental health experts are highlighting the unique challenges in diagnosing and treating depression in older adults, who may face greater stigma and have their symptoms misattributed to the normal aging process. While the core symptoms are similar across age groups, depression in the elderly often presents with more physical complaints, leading to delayed recognition and chronic conditions. Treatment can be complicated by potential interactions between antidepressants and other medications for physical ailments. Experts stress the importance of overcoming stigma and seeking professional help, as early diagnosis significantly improves the chances of effective treatment.</p>

          <p>LaQuayia Goldring, 35, has received a new kidney from a living donor just days after her decade-long wait for a transplant was featured on "CBS Sunday Morning." Goldring, who had been on dialysis since her first transplanted kidney failed in 2014, had become a vocal advocate for others with advanced kidney disease. Her new kidney came from an unidentified man in Georgia who chose to become a living donor. Goldring plans to continue sharing her story to raise awareness about the critical importance of both living and deceased organ donation.</p>

          <p>NASA is closely monitoring the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), a vast and growing region of weakened magnetic intensity over South America and the southwestern coast of Africa. This "dent" in the Earth's magnetic field poses a risk to orbiting spacecraft, including the International Space Station, by exposing them to higher levels of charged solar particles that can cause system malfunctions. Research indicates the anomaly is not only drifting but also appears to be splitting into two distinct cells. Scientists believe the phenomenon is a recurrent event, potentially linked to a massive, dense rock formation deep beneath the African continent.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that in her early career, she would budget just $40 to last for three days, a practice that taught her the value of financial security. While this method worked for her, financial advisors today caution against such restrictive, day-to-day budgeting for freelancers and gig workers with unpredictable income. Experts recommend a "bucketing strategy," where income is allocated by percentage to categories like essentials, savings, and taxes. This approach provides more flexibility to absorb income volatility and builds a more stable financial foundation than simply rationing cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) remain an attractive savings tool, with top accounts offering interest rates that exceed the current rate of inflation, thereby protecting the buying power of money. While national average yields are modest, online banks are providing highly competitive rates, particularly for short-term CDs of six months to one year. For example, some 1-year CDs offer rates around 4.40% APY, far surpassing the national average of 2.04%. Experts suggest savers consider online banks and potentially ladder their CDs to take advantage of the current inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>
