          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of its residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company unlawfully tracked and collected user data. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, this settlement, which covers allegations in two separate lawsuits, is a significant win for Texans' privacy. The settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement with Meta for unauthorized use of biometric data.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge William Sessions stated that Ozturk was detained for expressing her opinion and that there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence. Ozturk's attorneys argued that her detainment was retaliatory and violated her constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington as documents related to his abandoned federal corruption case were released. Adams stated that he planned to discuss New York City priorities, including infrastructure projects. The meeting occurred after the Trump administration moved to shutter the criminal case against Adams, leading to the release of related material, including search warrants and affidavits. The material reveals that the FBI and prosecutors investigated whether Adams committed witness tampering, though he was not charged with that crime. The Justice Department's decision to abandon the case caused an uproar within the department, leading to resignations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Republicans explore extending President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, Trump has signaled agreement with the idea of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to enable cuts for lower-income earners. Trump stated that this move is "good politics" and a form of redistribution, where wealthier individuals give up a small portion to benefit those with lower incomes. He dismissed comparisons to George H.W. Bush's broken promise of "no new taxes," arguing that Bush lost due to Ross Perot, not the tax statement. Trump acknowledged potential criticism from Democrats but remained open to the possibility of tax increases on the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs under the Trade Expansion Act.
