          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision to temporarily prevent President Trump from removing Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's governing board. The ruling, which came just before a key interest rate meeting, cited the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to protect the central bank from political influence. The Trump administration sought to fire Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, in a move seen by critics as an attempt to gain more control over the Fed's decisions.

          <p>As autumn approaches, experts suggest it is an ideal time for home decluttering, a process that can reduce stress and improve well-being. Key strategies include starting with small, manageable tasks like a single drawer to avoid feeling overwhelmed and planning ahead for where discarded items will go, whether to charity, recycling, or for sale. Psychologists and professional organizers also advise focusing on keeping items that bring joy and distinguishing between true sentimental value and nostalgia for the past.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is re-evaluating the risks and benefits of menopause hormone therapy, potentially leading to the removal of "black box" warnings about stroke and cancer risks from some treatments. Many doctors now argue that the initial research from 2002, which caused widespread fear, was flawed because it focused on older women who started therapy long after menopause began. More recent studies suggest that when started at an appropriate age, the therapy is the most effective treatment for perimenopausal symptoms, prompting a new conversation about its safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, a proposal the Securities and Exchange Commission is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. While some business leaders have supported ending quarterly guidance, critics of the proposal argue that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from UCLA are releasing a nontoxic, bright pink dye into the Santa Monica Bay to study how ocean currents affect the area's notoriously poor water quality. By tracking the fluorescent dye's movement, scientists hope to understand how a man-made breakwater built in the 1930s may be trapping pollutants near the Santa Monica Pier. The city, which frequently appears on lists of California's dirtiest beaches, hopes the study will provide insights to help finally resolve its long-standing water contamination issues.</p>

The piece suggests that as the U.S. focus shifts, China has a unique opportunity to rewire global trade and development, though it still faces economic challenges like slowing export growth.</p>

The agreement would require the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell it to a U.S.-based owner to address national security concerns over data privacy and potential propaganda. The move comes as a September 17 deadline approached, with the potential ban being a politically sensitive issue, especially among the app's 170 million American users.</p>
