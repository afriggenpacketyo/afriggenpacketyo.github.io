        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions flared during the third Test at Lord's over England's use of delay tactics, which India's players protested. England opener Zak Crawley successfully delayed the final moments of play to ensure he only faced one over instead of a potential two, prompting an angry reaction from India's captain. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed the complaints, pointing to India's own time-wasting earlier in the match, including a player receiving a massage on the field. The incident added a dramatic finish to the day's play.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek's victory at Wimbledon is being hailed as a surprising and significant achievement, as she conquered a surface on which she was not previously dominant. Known as the "Queen of Clay," the 24-year-old had struggled to find her top form over the past year and had never won a Tour-level title on grass. This article explores how she overcame personal and professional challenges, including a brief ban for a contaminated sample, to develop her grass-court game. Her win marks her sixth Grand Slam title and demonstrates a new level of versatility in her play.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They defeated their unseeded opponents in straight sets, 6-2 7-6 (7-3), to claim the Grand Slam victory. This achievement marks the first time two British men have won a Grand Slam doubles championship since 1936. The pair had set two goals for the year: to win a Slam and to qualify for the ATP Finals, and expressed that winning at Wimbledon was especially meaningful.</p>

For the 24-year-old Swiatek, this is her sixth Grand Slam title and her first on a grass court, a surface previously considered her weakest. A nervous Anisimova struggled throughout the match, but her journey to her first major final was still an impressive comeback story.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump renewing his tariff campaign against major trading partners, the stock market has remained relatively stable near record highs. This contrasts with the market panic seen during a similar tariff blitz in April. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation style and are focusing more on underlying economic fundamentals and corporate earnings. Key bullish themes, such as deregulation and the growth of artificial intelligence, are seen as powerful drivers that currently outweigh the concerns over potential trade disruptions.
