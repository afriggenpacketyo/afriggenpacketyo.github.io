          <p>Thomas Barrack, the new U.S. envoy to Syria, made his first official visit to Damascus, signaling a warming of relations between the two countries after over a decade of strained ties. Appointed by President Trump shortly after the President lifted sanctions on Syria, Barrack raised the American flag over the U.S. ambassador‚Äôs residence and met with Syrian officials, urging them to normalize relations with Israel. Shortly after the visit, Syria‚Äôs energy ministry signed a $7 billion investment deal with a Qatari-based company to help rebuild the country's war-torn infrastructure, which Barrack credited to the lifting of U.S. sanctions. Barrack also indicated the Trump administration would remove Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House, where he emphasized that the central bank's monetary policy decisions would be based on objective, non-political analysis. This meeting occurred amidst Trump's repeated calls for lower interest rates, which he believes would give the U.S. an economic advantage over countries like China. The Fed confirmed that Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, but stressed that future policy would depend entirely on incoming economic information. Markets largely expect the Fed to hold steady on rates until there's more clarity on tariff uncertainty.</p>

          <p>According to projections from industry tracker IWSR, non-alcoholic beer is on track to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category by volume worldwide this year. While overall beer volume decreased slightly in 2024, the non-alcoholic segment experienced a 9% growth. This trend is driven by more consumers, particularly younger generations, moderating their alcohol consumption and brewers investing in better-tasting zero-proof alternatives. Lager remains the dominant beer category, but non-alcoholic beer's increasing popularity is fueled by brands like Athletic Brewing and celebrity-backed ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration's efforts to restrict Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The move comes after the same judge granted a temporary restraining order last Friday, and aims to maintain the status quo while the legal process continues. Harvard has nearly 7,000 international students, who make up more than a quarter of the student body, and the ability to enroll these students represents a crucial financial lifeline for the university. The ruling provides some temporary relief for international students, but the legal battle is ongoing.</p>
