          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking the Trump administration's policy to expand fast-track deportations. The ruling cites concerns that the expansion, which applies to migrants anywhere in the U.S. for up to two years, likely violates constitutional due process rights. While the long-standing use of expedited removal near the border remains unaffected, this decision significantly curtails the administration's interior enforcement strategy. The Department of Homeland Security has stated it will appeal the decision, asserting the president has clear legal authority for the policy.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical timeout, the 24-time Grand Slam champion fought back to secure the victory. This loss ends British singles participation in the tournament. Norrie acknowledged he may have been overconfident after an early break in the third set, but expressed satisfaction with his recent return to form.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record by rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was fraught with challenges, including tropical storms that forced detours and even swept one brother overboard. The feat breaks the previous record of 162 days set in 2014. The brothers also successfully raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar during their arduous voyage.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of California's Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. The scenic route through the Angeles National Forest suffered from slope failures, rock slides, and collapsed pavement during the winters of 2022 and 2023, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is expected to restore access to popular hiking trails and reduce overcrowding at other trailheads.</p>

          <p>Investment managers are growing more optimistic about Chinese stocks as the Shanghai Composite Index reaches a 10-year high, attracting both domestic and overseas investors. Analysts suggest the rally is supported by domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and by Beijing's strategic push for technological innovation. With a massive US$22 trillion in domestic savings, the rotation into equities could provide a significant catalyst for the market. Global asset managers see room for Chinese equities to catch up with other major markets that are already trading near historic highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the administration likely acted unlawfully. The judges found that the Homeland Security Secretary does not have the statutory authority to vacate a prior extension of TPS, which was granted by the Biden administration. The court emphasized that Congress designed the TPS system to be predictable and insulated from shifting electoral politics.</p>

          <p>Musician Cardi B took the witness stand to deny allegations that she assaulted a security guard, Emani Ellis, in 2018. Ellis claims the rapper spat on her and cut her cheek with a long fingernail, but Cardi B testified that while a heated verbal argument occurred, it never became physical. The rapper stated the guard invaded her privacy by filming her and discussing her then-private pregnancy on the phone. Moments from the civil trial, including the rapper's animated testimony and a lawyer's questions about her wigs and nails, have since gone viral on social media.</p>

          <p>A charity program is helping anxious and disengaged teenagers improve their school attendance by pairing them with toddlers from a local nursery. The teens act as mentors, a responsibility which helps them build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of accountability. One 13-year-old participant saw her school attendance more than double after joining the scheme. The program, run by the charity Power2, has shown significant success, with 78% of participants improving their attitude toward learning and 83% showing improved self-esteem. The initiative aims to address the rising issue of school avoidance since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A new film starring Julia Roberts, "After The Hunt," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to a divided reception. The movie follows a college professor, played by Roberts, caught between a student who alleges sexual assault and a colleague who denies the accusation. The film deliberately avoids presenting a clear version of events, casting ambiguity on both accounts to provoke debate. Roberts defended the approach, stating the goal is to challenge audiences and encourage conversation about complex issues, acknowledging that the film's moral ambiguity is intended to be unsettling for viewers.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly considering measures to speed up the reinstatement of service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Officials are also weighing whether to grant honorable discharges to those whose separation was solely due to vaccine refusal. Since the Biden-era mandate was rescinded, only a small fraction of the hundreds who applied have been reinstated, a process veterans have described as slow and difficult. A listening session with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to address the issue and gather feedback from affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Following the engagement announcement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, wedding planners and style experts are speculating on what the high-profile event might look like. Given Swift's penchant for intentionality and secrecy, experts predict a private, intimate affair at a location with personal significance, possibly requiring non-disclosure agreements from all involved vendors. The singer is expected to be heavily involved in the planning, potentially choosing lesser-known but talented vendors to tell their story. The wedding gown is anticipated to be romantic and refined, reflecting her red-carpet style, with possibilities ranging from American to international couture designers.</p>
