          <p>President Trump's extensive domestic policy package, which includes permanent tax cuts and significant spending changes, cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate late Saturday. The motion to proceed passed narrowly, 51-49, after considerable drama and last-minute negotiations to secure votes from Republican holdouts. Democrats are now forcing a full reading of the 940-page bill, signaling a contentious path ahead for the legislation, which faces another vote in the House and concerns over its $3.9 trillion impact on the national debt.

          <p>This excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," delves into the formative years of William F. Buckley Jr. It details the story of his parents, his father's ventures in the oil industry in Mexico and Venezuela, and the family's eventual settlement on a large estate in Sharon, Connecticut. The piece paints a vivid picture of the bustling, devout Catholic household with ten children where Buckley grew up. This environment, shaped by his father's strong will and the family's wealth, is presented as the foundation of his later identity as a leader of the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound impact of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The book traces a direct line from Buckley's intellectual leadership to key figures like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and ultimately, Donald Trump. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," effectively invented cultural politics and reshaped the Republican Party. The analysis suggests that the modern GOP, including Trump's anti-elite rhetoric, is built on the foundation Buckley created.</p>

Corenswet, a Juilliard-trained actor, acknowledges the legacy of Christopher Reeve but aims to bring his own interpretation to the role.

These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. The other two questions explore if a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. According to the article, these elements are crucial for maintaining emotional intimacy, resolving conflict constructively, and fostering a secure, healthy partnership.</p>

Jain explains that in a startup environment, every team member must be able to identify a problem, devise a solution, and then get into the details to implement it. To assess this, she asks candidates to describe a problem they solved, listening for their level of detail and enthusiasm for the entire process.</p>
