          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was averted when the family of Billy Joe Cagle, 49, alerted police to his threatening social media livestream. Cagle, who has a history of mental health issues, was arrested at the airport, and police found an AR-15-style rifle with 27 rounds in his truck. Officials praised the family's quick action, stating that their intervention likely saved numerous lives. Atlanta's mayor emphasized the success of the "See something, say something" principle in preventing a tragedy, as Cagle now faces charges including making terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a felon.</p>

          <p>General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson announced that the company anticipates its 2026 earnings will exceed its 2025 results, which have already surpassed Wall Street expectations. This positive forecast follows GM's decision to raise its 2025 guidance, citing factors like reduced electric vehicle losses, lower warranty costs, and tariff offsets. The company's stock rose over 10% following the news, and executives reaffirmed their commitment to share buybacks and achieving 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America. Analysts view the commentary as encouraging, signaling a potential cultural shift towards faster adaptation and improved financial performance for the automaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, student loan borrowers have several avenues for assistance. Key Federal Student Aid call centers remain operational because they are staffed by contractors, not direct government employees. Borrowers can still reach their loan servicers, which are also government contractors, for help with billing, payments, and applications for forbearance or deferment. While processes like employment verification for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) continue, the final approval for most loan forgiveness programs is on hold as it requires Education Department staff. Borrowers can identify their servicer through the official Studentaid.gov website.</p>

The company stated it has received unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire business, just months after revealing plans to split into two separate entities. CEO David Zaslav confirmed the review of all strategic alternatives to maximize asset value, with sources indicating that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties. This development comes as WBD continues to manage over $40 billion in debt from the 2022 merger, despite progress in cost-cutting and debt reduction.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola's third-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed analyst expectations, yet the company acknowledged that consumer demand remains soft, though it is showing signs of improvement. The beverage giant reported a 1% increase in unit case volume, a positive reversal from the previous quarter, but key markets like North America and Latin America saw flat volume. Executives noted that low-income consumers in the U.S. are purchasing fewer products, prompting a focus on more affordable options like mini cans. The company reaffirmed its full-year forecast, projecting a 3% rise in comparable earnings per share and 5% to 6% growth in organic revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Australia have established an $8.5 billion framework to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals and rare earths, aiming to reduce American dependence on China. The agreement will mobilize at least $1 billion in financing for projects in each country within six months, supporting capital expenditures and finalizing offtake arrangements for buyers. Analysts believe this deal is a significant first step in developing an independent supply chain, a process that could take one to two decades. The pact is expected to concern Beijing as it strengthens the U.S. position by providing access to Australian technology and creating price floors for minerals.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a plan to cut red tape for businesses by scrapping "needless form filling," a move the Treasury estimates will save firms nearly £6 billion annually. The reforms include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. Speaking at an investment summit, Reeves stated the changes aim to boost growth and make the UK a top destination for global capital. However, business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses remain skeptical, warning that the announcement would "ring hollow" if the upcoming budget introduces new tax hikes for employers.</p>

He emphasized that proper meeting etiquette, including active listening and preparation, demonstrates care and passion for one's work. Dimon stated that he gives 100% of his attention in meetings and expects the same from others, advocating for meetings to be purposeful, timely, and followed up with action items. Experts support this view, suggesting that taking notes by hand can improve focus and comprehension compared to digital methods, which can lead to multitasking and distraction.</p>

          <p>Financial and healthcare experts are advising seniors on how to prepare for surprise medical costs in retirement, as many underestimate expenses and misunderstand Medicare coverage. A 65-year-old retiring this year can expect to pay an average of $172,500 in healthcare costs, with traditional Medicare not covering long-term care, dental, or vision. Recommendations include thoroughly understanding Medicare gaps, building a dedicated medical emergency fund of $5,000 to $10,000, and securing supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, planning for potential long-term care costs through specialized insurance or annuities is crucial to protect retirement savings from being depleted by unexpected health issues.</p>

          <p>A new system combining a tiny implantable chip and specialized glasses is successfully restoring central vision for patients with atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of sight loss. In a multi-country trial, over 80% of participants showed significant improvement, with many able to read words and numbers again. The system works by using a camera on the glasses to transmit visual data to the chip implanted in the retina, which then converts the images into electrical signals for the brain. Developed through a collaboration between Stanford University and the Pittsburgh School of Medicine, the technology is now seeking regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached for two British prisoners, Lindsay Sandiford and Shahab Shahabadi, to be transferred from Indonesia back to the UK. Sandiford, 69, has been on death row for over a decade after being convicted of trafficking cocaine in 2013, while Shahabadi, 35, is serving a life sentence. The Indonesian minister for law and human rights cited the poor health of both prisoners as a key factor in the decision, noting Sandiford is seriously ill and Shahabadi is suffering from severe mental health disorders. The transfer is expected to occur in approximately two weeks, once technical details are finalized between the two countries.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway to restore the fishery without restricting access. The nonprofit Reef Doctor is building artificial reefs by sinking limestone chunks and seeding them with marine life to create new fish habitats. This approach directly addresses the food insecurity driving the over-exploitation, as poverty and climate-driven migration have pushed too many people to depend on a collapsing ecosystem. The project is part of a large-scale study linking environmental restoration to human health, aiming to prove that ecological interventions can serve as public health solutions in impoverished nations.</p>

An airline spokesperson clarified that the intercom used for communication between pilots and flight attendants had been left on accidentally, causing the noise. Passengers were reportedly confused by the incident, as the captain initially explained they were returning to figure out what was happening with the airplane.

          <p>General Motors has raised its annual financial forecast, now expecting adjusted core profit between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from a previous estimate. The automaker also lowered its expected financial hit from tariffs, citing anticipated relief from the Trump administration's expansion of credits for U.S. auto production. This improved outlook comes as GM navigates a weakening electric vehicle market, having recently taken a $1.6 billion charge for changes to its EV strategy. CEO Mary Barra stated that by acting decisively to address overcapacity, the company expects to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond. (not investment advice)</p>
