          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a dinner for approximately two dozen leading tech and business figures, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Sam Altman, at the renovated White House Rose Garden. The event, following a separate White House summit on artificial intelligence, highlights the administration's complex but close relationship with the technology sector. Many of the invited executives have cultivated ties with Trump, aligning with his administration's objectives on emerging technologies and domestic manufacturing. Notably absent from the initial invitation list was Elon Musk, who later stated he was invited but unable to attend.</p>

The collaboration aims to develop and offer private market investment products to retail investors, including wealth and retirement funds. This move is intended to bolster T. Rowe Price, which has faced challenges and significant withdrawals due to its slower adoption of ETFs. The deal aligns with a recent executive order by President Trump encouraging greater access to alternative assets in 401(k) plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, its lowest point since last October, according to Freddie Mac. This continued decline in borrowing costs provides potential relief for homebuyers by increasing their purchasing power. The trend is largely influenced by growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed's actions do not directly set mortgage rates, they heavily influence the bond market yields that lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common perception of anxiety as a purely negative state, some psychological and philosophical viewpoints suggest it can be a powerful tool for personal growth and adventure. Philosopher Søren Kierkegaard viewed confronting one's anxiety as life's most important opportunity. Modern research indicates that moderate levels of anxiety can enhance performance and lead to "flow" states, while overcoming existential anxiety from stressful life events can foster a clearer sense of life's meaning. The key is to accept anxiety as a normal alert system and reframe it as an exciting challenge rather than suppressing it.</p>

          <p>A former police detective shared crucial steps to take immediately following a car crash, based on both professional and recent personal experience in a head-on collision. Key advice includes avoiding apologies at the scene, as saying "I'm sorry" can be interpreted as an admission of guilt, potentially affecting liability claims. Instead, it is important to remain calm, ensure everyone's safety, turn off the engine, and exchange necessary contact and insurance details. Documenting the scene with photos and gathering witness information are also vital for accurately understanding and reporting the incident to authorities and insurers.</p>

This financial strength is driven by massive media rights deals and high viewership, with NFL games accounting for 72 of the top 100 U.S. telecasts in the previous year.
