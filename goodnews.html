          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for a third term in 2026, according to a senior GOP official familiar with her plans. First elected in 2014 as the first female combat veteran in the Senate, her departure is expected to set off a highly competitive race for the open seat. Representative Ashley Hinson is reportedly preparing to launch a campaign, while several Democrats have already announced their intention to run. This development creates a significant political contest in a state that has increasingly favored Republicans in recent federal elections.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy. As a leader of an economic powerhouse that bridges competing ideologies, Indonesia is not confined to a single political camp. The article argues that Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a model for an international system often paralyzed by competing national interests. This approach emphasizes practical cooperation over ideological confrontation, potentially offering a new road map for middle powers to navigate complex global challenges.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, drawing a range of critical responses. The Netflix-produced film, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature, is described as an ambitious, large-scale project that del Toro has wanted to make for decades. While some critics praised it as one of the director's finest works for its artistry and emotional depth, others found it lengthy and lacking substance. The film explores the story from both the creator's and the creature's perspectives, reflecting del Toro's signature empathy for monstrous characters.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II approaches, a look into the shared history of Sino-American cooperation is being presented as a potential key to improving current bilateral relations. The article highlights the forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the American airmen who were protected by Chinese villagers during the war against Japan. This historical alliance, forged in a global fight against fascism, is being extolled as a foundation for building better ties from the ground up. The focus is on remembering a period of mutual support to foster goodwill amid contemporary geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A proposal to silence a 150-year-old town clock in Machynlleth, Wales, between midnight and 7:00 a.m. has been rejected by the town council. The request came from the owner of a nearby hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes throughout the night. However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character and denied the request. The hotel owner expressed disappointment with the decision and is now considering other options, including gathering opinions from other local residents and businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, child development experts generally agree on precautionary principles for children's screen time. For the first few years, they recommend minimal to no screen time to allow for crucial exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children age, the focus shifts from time limits to content quality and parental supervision, with recommendations gradually increasing to about two hours for older teenagers. Experts stress that excessive screen time can negatively impact language skills, motor development, and social interaction, urging parents to foster a balanced digital life.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Wales, organized a rescue effort to move thousands of fish after a local waterway, Aberhafesp Brook, dried up due to prolonged drought conditions. A local man discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking puddle and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency, rallied friends to help. The group spent hours moving salmon, trout, and other species to a nearby river. Natural Resources Wales later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the rescuers felt they had no choice but to act.</p>
