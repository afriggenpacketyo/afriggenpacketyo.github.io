          <p>Indivisible, a progressive grassroots organization, has reignited its opposition to Donald Trump's agenda, experiencing a surge in new chapters since his return to the White House. Founded in 2016 by Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg, Indivisible uses tactics like town halls, rallies, and protests to pressure members of Congress. The organization emphasizes the importance of mass peaceful protest and building a broad-based coalition to block Trump's agenda. Despite facing obstacles and criticism, Indivisible aims to align Democrats against what it views as an increasingly authoritarian threat.</p>

Dai also expresses excitement for Lena Dunham's upcoming Netflix show, Too Much, and admiration for Kathryn Hahn's acting.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with services now the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator. The government emphasized plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure but refrained from promising lower fares. Unions voiced concerns over potential outsourcing of staffing to private companies, while the opposition criticized Labour for needing to deliver on promises. Further renationalization is expected with C2C and Greater Anglia later this year. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the move as a watershed moment.</p>

The judge ruled in Bacci‚Äôs favor because management stopped issuing additional rule violations once a 30-day notice to vacate was posted.

The tour delves into the vicious partisan politics of the 1790s and the origins of the two-party system, prompting visitors to reflect on parallels with contemporary political divides. The tour draws on the founders' collaboration on the Declaration of Independence and their contrasting views on the Constitution. It seeks to foster civil disagreement and dialogue by modeling how to disagree better, reminding visitors that unity is possible even amidst differences.</p>
