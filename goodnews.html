          <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Louisiana after being detained for over three months. A U.S. District Judge granted Khalil's release on bail, a decision criticized by the Trump administration, which argues that an immigration judge should have the authority to decide on his release.
