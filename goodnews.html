          <p>A cyclist in Belfast's Victoria Park was astonished to spot a 4-foot starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River, a species previously observed in urban waterways like the Thames. Marine biologist Dr. Patrick Collins suggested the shark was likely feeding on crabs in the river, noting that while not typical, such sightings have been recorded in recent years. The cyclist recounted his disbelief at seeing the dorsal fin and filming the shark as it navigated the river, emphasizing his surprise and curiosity about how far upstream it might travel, adding to the sense of wonder in an otherwise ordinary urban setting.</p>

Slaton, a nutritionist, sustained injuries and was unable to call for help, surviving for weeks on wild leeks, snowmelt, and tea made from manzanita and pine needles. She lost her tent and sleeping bags but managed to forage and find shelter, eventually being discovered in a cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, who found her just in time, as she had endured 13 heavy snowstorms.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former FBI Director James Comey regarding a social media post featuring seashells arranged to form "86 47," a phrase critical of President Trump, after some officials claimed it was an assassination threat. Comey voluntarily consented to the interview, which took place at a Secret Service office in Washington. Critics have accused Trump administration officials of overreacting to the post to harass a perceived enemy, given Comey's history as a target of Trump's ire since his firing as FBI director in 2017 during the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>A fisherman in Lake Michigan discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank in 1923, marking a significant find for maritime historians. The tug, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, used for moving lumber and railway cars. The ship was buried in sand for decades before recent storms exposed it, prompting historians to race against time to document shipwrecks before quagga mussels destroy them, emphasizing the importance of preserving lost history.</p>
