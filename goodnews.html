          <p>James Comey addressed the controversy surrounding his recent Instagram post featuring the number '8647' written in seashells on a beach, claiming it was an innocent coincidence discovered during a walk with his wife. Comey explained that his wife interpreted '86' as a term for removing an item from a menu, while he recalled it meaning 'to ditch a place' from his childhood. Despite the innocent explanation, the post sparked accusations from Trump allies, leading to a Secret Service investigation and Comey voluntarily appearing for an interview at the Washington field office. Comey warned against the administration's use of power to target individuals and erode the rule of law.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain calm and not panic following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt. He drew parallels to previous downgrades in 2011 and 2023, noting that market declines following those events were not justified by the underlying economic conditions. Cramer suggested that investors should view the downgrade as a warning to save and invest more, rather than a signal to sell off their portfolios. He cautioned against succumbing to fear, arguing that those who promote such sentiment are either misinformed or have a vested interest in creating market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian, testifying against her alleged attackers in Paris, made a statement by wearing a vintage John Galliano dress and millions of dollars' worth of diamonds. This act is seen as reclaiming her freedom after being robbed at gunpoint in 2016, where millions of dollars' worth of jewelry was stolen. The incident had led to criticism that Kardashian was too public about her wealth. By wearing the diamonds, she is defying the critics and asserting her right to engage in conspicuous consumption.

These dogs can sniff out the insect's eggs, which can damage trees and fruit crops.

The dogs were trained through a research project led by Virginia Tech University. The spotted lanternfly is native to eastern Asia and has spread across the East coast and into the Midwest.</p>
