          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining current interest rates, savers are considering the best certificate of deposit (CD) strategy. Experts suggest short-term CDs may be more advantageous this June due to higher interest rates and earlier maturity dates compared to long-term options. Answering the question of whether you are trying to maximize the amount of cash that you're earning or if it is a per purchase choice can help guide you on whether a short-term CD or a long-term CD would be a better option for your particular situation. A CD ladder strategy, using CDs with varying maturity dates, can also be beneficial in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on immigration applications, offering relief to immigrants from various countries whose legal status was threatened. The ruling supports pro-immigrant advocates who argued that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law. The programs affected rely on legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. The order prevents those who entered the U.S. under those policies from obtaining other forms of legal status, like asylum, Temporary Protected Status or permanent residency.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a surge following a U.S. court's decision to block President Trump's tariffs on China and other major trade partners. The ruling, which invalidated levies on numerous countries, was viewed as a positive development by investors, signaling potential relief from a trade war that threatened economic and corporate growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw increases, although the Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling, leaving the ultimate fate of the tariffs uncertain. The ruling did not impact sector-specific tariffs on items like autos, steel, and aluminum.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent court ruling that struck down President Trump's tariffs is being viewed as a vindication of the rule of law, rather than judicial overreach. The court determined that neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes Trump to impose the tariffs he ordered, affirming Congress's power over trade. This decision is supported by the Constitution's delegation of tariff power to Congress and the fact that states, acting as checks on federal power, requested the ruling. The Court of International Trade's role is to exercise authority over trade disputes, making this ruling central to its purview.</p>
