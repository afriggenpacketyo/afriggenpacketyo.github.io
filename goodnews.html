        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Army is implementing a two-phase plan to separate service members experiencing gender dysphoria, following President Trump's executive order prioritizing military excellence and readiness. The first phase, ending June 6, allows service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate with separation pay eligibility based on years of service. The second phase involves involuntary separation, identifying service members through records reflecting their sex at birth. The Army spokesperson stated that every service member will be treated with dignity and respect throughout the process. </p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen significantly, with some areas experiencing temperatures 4¬∞C above normal, creating a marine heatwave. This phenomenon, driven by a warm spring and weak winds, could disrupt marine life breeding patterns and lead to influxes of jellyfish and harmful algae blooms. Scientists are surprised by the heatwave's persistence, lasting over two months, and its potential to influence land temperatures. While the UK is usually protected from severe impacts due to cooler waters, the long-term effects on marine ecosystems remain uncertain. </p>

          <p>The Army has begun preparations to transport Abrams tanks and other military equipment to Washington, D.C., for a 250th birthday parade on June 14, which coincides with President Trump's birthday. The event, expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, has drawn speculation about Trump's desire for a grand military display, similar to a parade that was canceled during his first term due to high costs. The parade will feature soldiers in period costumes, historical equipment, and aircraft, tracing the Army's evolution from the Revolutionary War to the present. The U.S. Secret Service has designated the event a "national security special event," requiring significant security measures. </p>

          <p>Canada is engaged in high-level discussions with the U.S. regarding potential participation in its proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system. Prime Minister Markey Carney confirmed ongoing talks, emphasizing that military decisions and evaluations are underway. This openness follows recent trade and security negotiations between the two countries, sparked by President Trump's tariff threats. The proposed Golden Dome system aims to counter advanced aerial threats, including hypersonic missiles, using space-based sensors and interceptors, with potential costs reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters following a court ruling that deemed the Trump administration's takeover "null and void". This development marks the end of a two-month legal battle that began after USIP employees were forcibly removed from the building in March. The Justice Department plans to appeal the ruling. The USIP was established by Congress to provide analysis and resources for peace efforts worldwide, but President Trump had declared the organization "unnecessary". </p>
