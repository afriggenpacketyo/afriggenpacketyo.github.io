          <p>ABC News reports that a federal judge in Florida suggested President Trump has the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally, citing a 1970s court case as precedent. Despite this, the judge transferred the case to the Court of International Trade in New York. The ruling is a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which faces multiple lawsuits challenging the legality of recent tariffs. The decision hinges on interpreting the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that NATO allies are considering redefining defense spending to meet President Trump's demand for 5% of national income.
