          <p>Liverpool has reportedly reached an agreement to acquire left-back Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth for ¬£40 million. The 21-year-old Hungary international is expected to join Liverpool after spending two seasons with Bournemouth, who have already secured Adrien Truffert from Rennes as his replacement. Kerkez's move is part of Liverpool's broader strategy to strengthen their squad, as they are also reportedly finalizing a club-record ¬£116m deal for Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz and have signed Jeremie Frimpong. Kerkez, who previously played for AC Milan and AZ Alkmaar, had a successful season with Bournemouth, playing in all 38 league games and contributing two goals and six assists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Agresti, president of Just Facts, refutes claims that President Trump's "big beautiful bill" will cut Medicaid benefits for the poor, stating it targets illegal immigrants and fraudsters. Democrats have criticized the bill, citing CBO reports suggesting millions would lose coverage, but Republicans argue their reforms focus on work requirements and eligibility checks to preserve the program for those truly in need. Agresti argues the reforms aim to incentivize work and lift people out of poverty, while Senator Bernie Sanders claims the bill raises copayments for the poor. Agresti counters that the bill does not raise copayments for those below the poverty line and reduces the maximum copayment for others, aiming to eliminate wasteful spending.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have discovered that people with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), exhibit significant differences in their blood compared to healthy individuals. The study, which analyzed data from the UK Biobank, compared 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals and found consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease. Experts believe these findings could lead to the development of a diagnostic blood test, providing biological evidence for the condition and addressing skepticism about its legitimacy. The research indicates that ME is primarily a condition affecting the blood and is not solely attributable to inactivity.</p>

The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling that ordered the metropolitan government and state to compensate Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada. The men were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production, but the indictment was later withdrawn.

The film traces the history of care in the U.S., from early 20th-century almshouses to the limitations of Medicare and Medicaid in covering long-term care. It also examines the role of activists in advocating for policy changes and the potential for future legislation to address the growing need for caregiving support.

          <p>The article challenges the notion that Gen Z is becoming a conservative generation, despite increased support for Donald Trump in the 2024 election. While young adults did vote for Trump at higher rates, data suggests they have not become more conservative in their ideological self-identification or their views on specific issues. The shift appears to be driven by young independent voters who are increasingly pessimistic and dissatisfied with the status quo, leading them to vote against the party in power. This generalized pessimism, rather than a genuine conservative shift, may bode better for Democrats in future elections.</p>
