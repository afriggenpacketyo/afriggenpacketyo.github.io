          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with stories including counter-terrorism police raids across England, resulting in multiple arrests related to a major terror plot. The Daily Telegraph notes these arrests, involving Iranian men, have sparked renewed calls for the government to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. Other papers focus on the political fallout from Reform UK's success in local elections, with the government considering measures to tackle immigration. The Financial Times highlights pressure on the prime minister to reverse winter fuel allowance cuts following Reform's electoral gains. The Daily Mirror and Daily Express feature VE day commemorations and a Ukrainian veteran's plea for continued British support. Finally, the Daily Star humorously reports on President Trump's budget cuts impacting the search for aliens.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey indicates that foreign visitors to Japan are most frustrated by the scarcity of public trash bins, particularly at train stations. This issue, cited by nearly 22% of surveyed visitors, forces tourists to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public areas is attributed to safety concerns following past terror attacks. Littering in tourist spots has become a significant concern due to the lack of disposal options. The survey also highlighted communication issues and overcrowding as other inconveniences for visitors.</p>
