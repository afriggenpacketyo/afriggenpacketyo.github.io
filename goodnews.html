        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential collision with a military aircraft, reportedly a B-52, during its landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed the 76 passengers that air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport, had not warned them about the converging aircraft. The pilot's quick thinking averted a potential disaster, earning applause from passengers after he calmly explained the situation. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the near-miss incident to determine how it occurred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has quantified the immense value of global emergency vaccine stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis, finding they have averted approximately 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths. These stockpiles, funded by organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, provide a rapid response to outbreaks that would otherwise be impossible given long vaccine manufacturing times. The research highlights over $32 billion in economic benefits, though this figure is considered a significant underestimate. These findings arrive at a critical time, as global health funding faces major cuts, raising concerns about the future of these life-saving programs.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions captain Owen Farrell opened up about the intense public and media criticism he often faces, describing both praise and negativity as a "poison." The 33-year-old fly-half acknowledged that the constant scrutiny can be challenging, depending on his mental state at the time. Despite not playing for England in 20 months, Farrell feels energized by his fourth Lions tour and is determined to enjoy the remainder of his career. He remains noncommittal about a return to the national team, stating his current focus is on the Lions and then his club, Saracens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) are urging Beijing to address the country's intense and inefficient 'neijuan,' or involutional competition, by expanding domestic market demand. They argue that this self-defeating cycle, where companies invest more for diminishing returns, stems from competing in a limited market space. The proposed solution involves macroeconomic policies that boost consumer demand, creating a larger market for businesses. Additionally, companies are encouraged to focus on research and development to offer differentiated products, fostering a more positive, demand-driven economic cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative environmental project, scientists have deposited 200,000 rare flat oyster larvae into the hull of a century-old shipwreck off the Belgian coast. The goal is to reintroduce the species, which has largely vanished from the North Sea due to overfishing and disease, and restore a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Oyster reefs naturally purify water and provide critical habitat for other sea life. The 1906 shipwreck was chosen because it is a protected heritage site where disruptive activities like fishing are banned, providing a sanctuary for the new oyster reef to grow.</p>

          <p>Following Scottie Scheffler's commanding victory at The Open, this article posits that Rory McIlroy's next great challenge is to overcome the world's number one player. Despite a successful season that included winning the Masters to complete the career Grand Slam, McIlroy remains a distant second to Scheffler in the world rankings. The analysis draws parallels between Scheffler's current dominance and McIlroy's own surge between 2011 and 2014. While McIlroy is now considered an all-time great, the article suggests that the drive to topple the seemingly unbeatable Scheffler will provide his motivation moving forward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As hot weather in Shasta County, California, increases sightings of the native Northern Pacific rattlesnake, wildlife experts are providing safety advice for residents. Rattlesnakes are generally not aggressive and will retreat if given space, but they may strike if they feel threatened or provoked. To avoid encounters, people should clear debris from their property, remove food sources that attract rodents, and be cautious on trails. If a bite does occur, victims should seek immediate medical attention, stay calm, and elevate the bite area, without attempting outdated remedies like cutting or sucking the wound.</p>

          <p>This article highlights an opt-in iPhone feature called Advanced Data Protection, which significantly enhances the security of data backed up to iCloud. By enabling this setting, users can apply end-to-end encryption to most of their iCloud data, including photos, notes, and voice memos. This means that not even Apple or law enforcement can access the scrambled data without the user's unique recovery key or a designated recovery contact. While not a default setting, activating it provides a crucial layer of privacy against data breaches, government requests, and other potential intrusions.</p>

He is accused of importing thousands of pounds of cocaine into the U.S. and smuggling firearms with the help of Mexican cartels.

          <p>China is set to achieve its goal of having 50,000 kilometers (about 31,000 miles) of operational high-speed rail by the end of the year, according to the Minister of Transport. The network has already expanded to 48,000km, accounting for over 70 percent of the world's total and connecting most of the country's major cities. This rapid expansion has fueled a surge in travel, with a record 2.24 billion passenger trips in the first half of 2025. Officials attribute the growth to a recovering economy, rising travel demand, and improved service quality across the vast network.</p>

          <h2>Ryanair Considers Increasing Staff Bonus for Identifying Oversized Luggage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:26:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated the airline is considering increasing the bonus paid to staff for intercepting passengers with oversized baggage. Currently, employees receive about €1.50 per bag, a practice intended to enforce the airline's strict luggage rules and prevent boarding delays. O'Leary defended the policy, noting that over 99% of passengers comply and that limited cabin space necessitates aggressive enforcement. The discussion comes as the budget airline reported a more than doubling of its quarterly profits, driven by a strong Easter season and a 21% rise in average fares.</p>
