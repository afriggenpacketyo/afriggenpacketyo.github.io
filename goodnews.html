          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, has announced its intention to move its primary listing location to the United States. The company will implement a dual listing, with its main listing hub shifting to the US while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This decision is aimed at allowing Wise's shares to trade on both a US stock exchange and the London Stock Exchange, which the company believes will benefit shareholders and enhance its global presence. The announcement led to a 7% increase in Wise's share price during early morning trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator is warning women using weight-loss jabs that these medications may affect the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, and for a period afterward, due to potential harm to unborn babies. The agency also recommends that women on Mounjaro using oral contraceptives should use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug or switch to another contraceptive method. The MHRA is concerned that the growing popularity of these drugs means many women are not using them safely or receiving adequate advice.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were successfully defused in Cologne, Germany, after the city's largest evacuation since the war's end. Over 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center following the discovery of the bombs during road construction preparations. The defusal operation took approximately an hour, and while such discoveries are common in Germany, the prominent location near Cologne's historic center made this event particularly significant. The evacuation included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, and the main train station, causing widespread disruption.</p>

The report highlights that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal-fired plants, leading to stranded assets. It emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals.
