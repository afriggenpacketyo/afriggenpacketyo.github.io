          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, preventing criminal punishment for women ending a pregnancy. The House of Commons approved an amendment to a crime bill, driven by concerns over police investigations of women for suspected illegal abortions. The change aims to remove vulnerable women from the criminal justice system, addressing cases where women were prosecuted for obtaining abortion pills illegally. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measure, fearing it would lead to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy. The amendment is a landmark reform protecting women from imprisonment for ending their pregnancies.</p>

          <p>A study by professor Andrew Hales and his research team found that men, more than women, ‚Äúwere consistently more open‚Äù to being talked about. The article examines the cultural perception that men, particularly straight men, are not skilled at gossiping, and the impact this has on male social connections and the male loneliness epidemic. The article posits that the inability of men to share secrets, especially with other men, may contribute to this loneliness crisis. While the article acknowledges that men do gossip, it suggests they lack the cultural opportunities and training to do so effectively.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket as it seeks to expand into the space sector. The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, saw the prototype device land only 37 centimeters from its designated spot after a one-minute flight reaching nearly 300 meters. Honda hopes to develop the tech prowess for a suborbital launch by 2029. The company aims to utilize its existing technologies to develop reusable rockets for satellite-based communication tools and environmental monitoring.</p>

          <h2>U.K. Parliament Bans Women from Being Prosecuted for Late-Term Abortion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 07:09:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, barring women in England and Wales from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of term. The law changes rules governing abortions in a clinical setting, and it leaves open the possibility of prosecutions of anyone who assists a woman in getting a late-term abortion, including medical professionals. Supporters say the new law recognizes that these women need care and support, not criminalization. The new law still needs approval in the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords, before taking effect.</p>
