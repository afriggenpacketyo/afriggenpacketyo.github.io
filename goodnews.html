          <p>The Trump administration rescinded Biden-era guidance that restricted cryptocurrency investments in 401(k) plans.  This move removes barriers for employers to offer crypto and related digital assets in retirement plans.  The decision has drawn criticism from some financial experts who highlight the inherent risks associated with such investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>German Court Dismisses Peruvian Farmer's Climate Change Lawsuit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German court dismissed a Peruvian farmer's lawsuit against RWE, seeking damages for the company's alleged contribution to climate change-related flood risks. The court cited the low probability of damage to the farmer's house as the reason for dismissal.  The decision, while rejecting the specific claim, is viewed by some as a step towards holding polluters accountable for climate change impacts.</p>
