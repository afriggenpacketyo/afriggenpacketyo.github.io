          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry over nine years to fund security-related technology research. This funding aims to support researchers amid declining operational subsidies to national universities and decreasing student numbers due to the country's low birthrate. Some universities are utilizing the funds for advanced projects, such as developing gas-absorbing sheets and AI systems to detect cyberattacks. An expert has expressed concern about the potential for military applications, highlighting the need to consider the risks associated with defense-related research funding.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. Scientists analyzed genetic data from prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia to identify the "ghost ancestry." This research fills a critical gap in understanding the migration, adaptation, and settlement of ancestors on the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

          <p>As legislative cuts threaten millions, anti-poverty organizers emphasize fighting for a new social contract that lifts from the bottom. Historical poor people's movements, like the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), offer insights for preventing democratic decline and overcoming bigotry. The NWRO, led by Black women, staged mass marches and advocated for welfare as a right and a guaranteed adequate income. The "Johnnie Tillmon model" proposes uniting the poor across differences, building projects of survival, and operating as an independent force.</p>

          <p>Dermatologists recommend wearing sunscreen on airplanes to protect against harmful UVA rays that can penetrate airplane windows. While airplane windows block most UVB rays, UVA rays can cause premature aging and contribute to skin cancer. A 2015 study found pilots and cabin crew have a higher incidence of melanoma compared to the general population. Wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses can provide added protection against ultraviolet exposure, especially for those with a personal or family history of skin cancer.</p>
