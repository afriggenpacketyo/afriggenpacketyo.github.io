          <p>The White House announced a trade deal with China following weekend negotiations, but specifics remain unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterized the talks as "productive" and promised a more detailed briefing soon. While details are scarce, any reduction in trade war tensions could offer relief to the global economy, which has been strained since President Trump's tariff announcement in April. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described the discussions as constructive and expressed confidence that the agreement would address national security concerns related to trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C., and Texas. This resettlement follows President Trump's executive order to prioritize Afrikaners, citing government-sponsored race-based discrimination, a claim strongly denied by South Africa's government. The initiative has sparked controversy, contrasting with the Trump administration's restrictive refugee policies. South Africa's foreign ministry criticized the move as politically motivated, while the U.S. State Department emphasized prioritizing Afrikaners facing racial discrimination.</p>
