          <p>The AI industrial trade is rebounding after market volatility, with GE Vernova leading the pack. While other data center-linked stocks like Eaton and Vertiv have also rallied, they haven't reached pre-DeepSeek levels like GE Vernova. GE Vernova's strong performance is attributed to its earlier stage in the revenue upcycle and a larger backlog of customer orders. Recent deals and support for the nuclear power industry have further boosted GE Vernova's stock, leading to a rating downgrade to hold due to its rapid rise. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasized the need to manufacture attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, and ballistic systems domestically, as Russia and Ukraine engage in an arms race.

          <p>The idea that everyone needs extreme amounts of protein to build muscle is a myth, according to experts. It's not necessary to consume one gram of protein per pound of body weight, and focusing too much on protein can lead to overconsumption of animal products. For gaining muscle, the benefits of eating more protein top out at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day, with weightlifters recommended to aim for between 0.54 and 0.73 grams. Plant-based protein is just as effective as animal protein for muscle gain, and a focus on whole plant foods is beneficial for overall health.</p>

          <p>The article explores how to encourage wealthy family and friends to donate to charity without being accusatory or making them defensive. It suggests understanding their perspectives, recognizing that they may have different ideas about "doing good," and avoiding moral judgment. Instead, emphasize the personal satisfaction derived from donating and create a positive environment for reflection, such as during a holiday gathering. The author suggests starting small, leading by example, and focusing on the joy of giving.</p>

The Gold Cup camp roster includes 16 players from MLS, signaling a shift from relying heavily on European-based players. Pochettino seeks players who know how to win and will fight for results, regardless of fame or club affiliation. This approach marks a potential reversion to an older USMNT identity, focusing on grit and determination.</p>

          <p>Target's sales have cratered, at least in part because consumers were angry about its reversals. The company's management has been a little vague about the impact of all this. At a May 21 conference call with Wall Street analysts following its release of earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, Cornell alluded to the backlash without going into detail. Cornell attributed the company‚Äôs ugly performance ‚Äî comparable-store sales down by 5.7% from a year earlier ‚Äî to several factors, including ‚Äúthe reaction to the updates we shared ... in January.‚Äù That was an obvious allusion to the dropping of DEI initiatives.</p>

The technology aims to reduce shoplifting by identifying unscanned items and showing a replay. While some shoppers joked about the tech, others expressed concerns about surveillance and privacy, with some vowing to avoid self-checkouts. The move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024.</p>
