        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of UK car finance customers may be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions paid by lenders to dealers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation scheme, expected to begin payouts in 2026, advising consumers against using claims companies for now. Eligibility largely depends on whether customers were treated "fairly," particularly those with banned discretionary commission arrangements. Individuals can check their contracts or await the FCA's scheme, which will include a consultation in October. This article provides crucial guidance for those potentially affected by mis-sold car finance.</p>

          <p>A communication expert advises avoiding nine common phrases that can diminish one's perceived authority and confidence in professional settings. Phrases like "I think," "Does that make sense?", and "Sorry to bother you" can signal doubt or undervalue one's message, leading to others overlooking ideas. The article recommends powerful swaps such as "I recommend," "Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything," and leading with purpose instead.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the surging popularity of Labubu, a "ugly-cute" plushie from Chinese company Pop Mart, which has become a global sensation. Its success is attributed to factors like scarcity, blind-box surprise, and a broader cultural shift towards "kidulthood," where adults embrace childlike objects publicly. Unlike previous trends, Labubu is openly displayed, challenging historical US views of adult "cuteness" as regressive. This trend reflects a changing perception of adulthood, with more people rejecting rigid norms and finding joy in playful expression. Pop Mart has successfully targeted young adults, capitalizing on this evolving cultural landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, noting that top accounts offer returns exceeding the current inflation rate, making them a safe investment option. National average yields for various terms are listed, alongside significantly higher rates available from online banks. It advises considering short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve, where shorter terms currently offer better rates. Strategies like "laddering" CDs are suggested to capitalize on high short-term rates while planning for the long term. This article offers practical advice for maximizing savings with CDs (not investment advice).</p>

Experts highlight ETFs' flexibility, lower costs, and tax advantages, but stress the need for a plan to navigate market fluctuations. Key advice includes avoiding trading during market open and close hours due to volatility, preferring the less "frothy" middle of the day. It also suggests using "limit orders" for greater control over purchase prices, while cautioning against market timing and advocating for dollar-cost averaging (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Scientists in Germany are meticulously studying a 1.2-million-year-old ice core, the oldest continuous sample ever drilled from Antarctica, hoping to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history. The core contains ancient air bubbles, allowing researchers to measure past greenhouse gas concentrations and understand the intricate connection between the carbon cycle and global temperatures. By extending the climate record beyond previous 800,000-year samples, the project aims to improve predictions for how Earth's climate will respond to future greenhouse gas increases. This article highlights the significance of this unprecedented scientific endeavor in understanding climate change.</p>

          <p>Tesla has granted CEO Elon Musk $29 billion worth of shares, aiming to retain him after a US court invalidated his 2018 pay package, valued at over $50 billion. The company's board expressed confidence this new award will incentivize Musk, especially amid an intensifying "war for AI talent." This move seeks to boost Musk's voting power and signals Tesla's pivot towards becoming an AI and robotics-focused company. The award is contingent on the Delaware court not reinstating the original 2018 deal, which Musk is currently appealing.</p>

          <p>The article explores impact-resistant shingles, also known as "Class 4" shingles, designed to better withstand severe weather events like hail and high winds. Made with flexible SBS material, these shingles undergo rigorous UL 2218 Impact Resistance Tests, with Class 4 being the highest rating. While not invincible, they significantly reduce severe damage compared to standard asphalt shingles. Though costing 10-25% more, the investment can be worthwhile, especially in storm-prone areas, as they may lead to lower future repair costs and potential insurance discounts. This article provides valuable information for homeowners considering a roof replacement.</p>
