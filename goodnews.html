          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the United States will maintain its existing tariffs on Chinese imports, even as trade negotiations continue between Washington and Beijing. This decision follows high-level trade talks in London, where both sides aimed to finalize a trade deal. Despite President Trump's claim of a completed deal, subject to final approval, Lutnick clarified that current tariffs will remain unchanged. This stance reflects ongoing tensions and unresolved issues in the trade relationship between the two economic superpowers. This suggests a cautious approach by the U.S. as it seeks a more balanced and reliable trade partnership with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of parents are adding their young children, even toddlers, as authorized users on their credit cards to help them establish a credit rating early in life. Financial experts suggest that this practice can provide children with a head start in building their credit history, which can be beneficial for future financial endeavors. Parents are also using this method to teach their children about the value of money and responsible spending habits. However, it's important for parents to manage their credit responsibly to avoid negatively impacting their children's credit scores. The practice reflects a growing awareness of the importance of credit in modern financial planning.</p>

          <p>Disney and Universal have filed a lawsuit against Midjourney, an AI image generator, alleging copyright infringement of their iconic characters. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney generates images that "blatantly incorporate and copy" characters from franchises like "Star Wars," Marvel, and "Despicable Me." The studios argue that Midjourney is a "quintessential copyright free-rider" and uses these images to promote its service. This marks the first time major studios have taken legal action against alleged AI-enabled intellectual property theft. The case underscores the growing concerns in Hollywood about the unauthorized use of generative AI.</p>

          <p>Many people experience a decline in friendships when they enter romantic relationships due to cultural emphasis on romantic partnerships. Society often prioritizes romantic relationships over platonic ones, leading to less time and effort invested in friendships. This can result in a sense of loss and alienation for friends who are not in romantic relationships. However, it is possible to prioritize both love and friendship by intentionally making time for friends and recognizing their distinct roles in one's life. Maintaining strong friendships alongside romantic relationships can enhance overall well-being.</p>
