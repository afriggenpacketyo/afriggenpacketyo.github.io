          <p>Prime Minister Modi informed President Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, without U.S. mediation. Modi emphasized India's consistent policy of rejecting third-party intervention in matters concerning Kashmir, clarifying that no trade deal discussions or U.S. mediation occurred between the Pahalgam attack and the ceasefire. Modi conveyed that India now views cross-border terrorism as an act of war and that operations against terrorists are ongoing, and the two leaders agreed to meet in person soon. The conversation aimed to address conflicting narratives and reaffirm India's stance on bilateral relations and counter-terrorism efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are using "tariff engineering" to reclassify products and lower duty rates by altering materials, dimensions, or compositions. This practice, which predates Trump's second term, involves strategically designing products to fit into different harmonized system codes with lower tariffs. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and modifying footwear to be categorized as slippers; however, heavily regulated sectors face challenges due to extensive validation requirements for even minor changes. While legal, this practice highlights the complexities of navigating international trade policies and the creative ways companies adapt to reduce tariff liabilities.</p>

The offer is intended to show that the Co-op is "on the front foot" ahead of summer trading and to encourage members who may have started shopping elsewhere to return.
