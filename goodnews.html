          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 12:28:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines four common mistakes homeowners should avoid when considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) this July. With interest rates lower than alternatives like personal loans and credit cards, it's crucial to monitor the rate climate actively and not assume HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions. The piece advises against overborrowing, as the home serves as collateral, and suggests using the funds for strategic purposes like value-adding renovations rather than discretionary spending. It emphasizes that an informed and cautious approach is key to successfully leveraging home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch, there is one crucial question candidates should ask at the end of a job interview to uncover a company's true culture: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers, revealing the organization's real values beyond corporate platitudes. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" or "someone who's too social" provide genuine insight into work-life balance and office dynamics. Welch advises asking this question after receiving an offer to ensure good rapport and to help candidates determine if the company is the right fit.</p>

These gains were achieved despite market turbulence driven by trade wars and geopolitical conflict.

The automaker sold 612,095 vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks, which had their best second quarter since 2019. Sales of "electrified" vehicles, including hybrids and EVs, also grew, though the increase was driven entirely by a 23.5% surge in hybrid sales, as pure EV sales dropped by 31.4%. This robust performance comes as the auto industry navigates the potential impacts of tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. (not investment advice)</p>

While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs reaching up to 4.40% APY. The report highlights the phenomenon of an "inverted yield curve," where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones.

          <p>In remarks at a European Central Bank forum, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated he would not rule out a potential interest rate cut at the Fed's upcoming meeting in July. While emphasizing that any decision depends on incoming economic data, the comment comes amid a sustained public pressure campaign from President Trump for the central bank to lower rates. Powell deflected direct questions about political pressure, stating the Fed remains "100% focused" on its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maximizing employment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With over 100 million Americans facing medical debt, this article outlines several potential avenues for relief. The most direct path is hospital charity care, which federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to offer, often providing free or discounted care to households with incomes up to 300-400% of the federal poverty level. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances, though this can impact credit scores. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or reorganize overwhelming medical debt, but this has serious long-term financial consequences.</p>
