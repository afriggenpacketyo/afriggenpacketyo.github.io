          <p>Existing home sales in the US recorded their slowest May since 2009, reflecting ongoing market challenges.  While sales increased slightly month-over-month, they were down compared to last year.  Affordability issues, high mortgage rates, and economic uncertainty are cited as contributing factors.  Despite rising inventory, home prices continue to increase, albeit at a slower pace.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced a 10-year industrial strategy including plans to lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green levies.  This measure aims to boost growth and competitiveness, potentially reducing energy bills by up to 25% for thousands of firms.  The strategy also includes initiatives to improve worker skills, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending. The plan aims to mitigate challenges from abroad and enhance the UK's economic standing.</p>

          <h2>Fed Governor Bowman Suggests Potential July Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 10:33:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated support for an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting, contingent on sustained low inflation.  Her statement follows similar comments from Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a potential shift in the Fed's approach.  The comments consider the likely muted impact of President Trump's tariffs on inflation.  The market's expectation of a rate cut in July remains relatively low (not investment advice).</p>
