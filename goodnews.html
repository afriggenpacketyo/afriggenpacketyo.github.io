          <p>An Austrian court has overturned Sebastian Kurz's conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. Kurz, once a rising star among European conservatives, had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence. He resigned as chancellor in 2021 after heading governing coalitions with both the far-right Freedom Party and the environmentalist Greens. The three-member panel of judges stated, "Sebastian Kurz... is acquitted," marking the end of a legal battle that has shadowed his post-chancellor career. The article provides context on Kurz's political background and the circumstances leading to his resignation.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker known for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which debunked the myth of widespread French resistance to Nazi occupation, has died at 97. The film, initially banned from French television, interviewed ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, revealing the complexities of collaboration and resistance during the war. Ophuls also directed "H√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," winning an Oscar for his work on the former head of the Gestapo in Lyon.

          <p>Food apps that rate the healthfulness of packaged foods are increasingly popular, but nutrition experts advise using them with skepticism. These apps can help consumers decode nutrition labels and nudge them toward healthier choices, but scores can vary between apps and may not always be justified. Experts recommend opting for apps that assess overall nutrient content rather than focusing solely on individual ingredients. It is also important to consider the quantity of ingredients and not to panic over minor additives, as some apps may overemphasize their impact.</p>

          <p>Japan has begun allowing Taiwanese individuals marrying Japanese citizens to list Taiwan as their place of origin in the family registry system, instead of China. The Justice Ministry's revision aligns the family register with Japan's residence registry. Taiwan has welcomed the move as a protection of Taiwanese rights in Japan, while China has criticized it, asserting Taiwan is part of its territory. This decision reflects Japan's stance of respecting China's claim on Taiwan while maintaining nongovernmental relations with the island.</p>

          <p>A review of BBC Sport pundits' Premier League predictions reveals that none of the 30 pundits correctly predicted Liverpool's title triumph. Opta's supercomputer, which simulated the season 10,000 times, favored Manchester City to win. However, five BBC pundits, including Fara Williams, correctly identified the top four teams, with Williams also accurately placing Arsenal in second and Chelsea in fourth.
