          <p>Singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts following a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition where cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain. This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance, according to Joel's website. NPH primarily affects older people and can cause gait issues, urinary incontinence, and cognitive difficulties. The most common treatment involves a surgical procedure called shunting, which regulates the amount of fluid in the brain, with symptoms typically improving within days or weeks of the shunt being implanted. </p>

Bethell, who missed the match against Zimbabwe due to his participation in the Indian Premier League, previously made three half-centuries in his debut series against New Zealand.

          <p>United Airlines will require all domestic passengers without checked luggage to check in at least 45 minutes ahead of departure, effective June 3. This change, an increase from the previous 30-minute requirement, aims to improve efficiency and streamline the check-in process. The airline says the added time will help their agents assist those who make the cut with their luggage, seating and arrangements. United Airlines stated that the new rule will be strictly enforced without exceptions. The check-in time for international travelers remains unchanged at 60 minutes. </p>
