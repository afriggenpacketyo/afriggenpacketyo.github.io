          <p>New research suggests that California could potentially support a robust grizzly bear population, reviving an old dream of bringing the iconic animal back to the state. The study identifies three regions suitable for reintroduction, citing the ecological benefits of having a top predator. While public support is mixed, with concerns about human-wildlife conflict, proponents emphasize a slow, deliberate reintroduction process. The return of grizzlies could have a symbolic impact, restoring a keystone species and honoring the cultural significance of the animal to Indigenous groups.</p>

The lead author of the study, Dr. Sanjula Singh, emphasized the interconnectedness of these conditions, noting that individuals who have experienced a stroke are more likely to develop depression or dementia, and vice versa.</p>

The Dalton High School in Alsdorf requires students to keep their phones turned off in their bags throughout the school day. Many teachers welcome the idea, saying that younger children are more relaxed and less distracted.
