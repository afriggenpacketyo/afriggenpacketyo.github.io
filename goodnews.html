          <p>During a speech at an investment conference in Riyadh, President Trump criticized decades of American policy in the Middle East, denouncing nation-building and interventionism. He urged the people of the region to chart their own destinies and expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a nuclear deal with Iran. Reactions to his speech were mixed, with some praising his emphasis on sovereignty and others questioning the potential impact on human rights. The article also notes Trump's meeting with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist, sparking controversy in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded healthcare benefits starting in 2026, citing a $12 billion budget deficit. The freeze, driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty, will not affect those already enrolled or children. Additionally, starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom attributed the shortfalls to President Trump's tariff policies, estimating a $16 billion loss in tax revenues for the state.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber will take a voluntary 25% pay cut following the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to the institution. The move comes after dozens of tenured professors pledged to donate 10% of their salaries to support the university's legal challenge against the funding freeze. The Trump administration cites Harvard's alleged failure to address race discrimination and antisemitism as justification for the funding cuts, while Harvard argues the cuts could impair research and staffing, rejecting conditions like halting diversity policies for resuming funding.</p>
