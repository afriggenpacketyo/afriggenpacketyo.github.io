Encounters range from gated communities in Arizona to white nationalist rallies in Tennessee, highlighting divisions and a loss of faith in living alongside others. The author contrasts these experiences with stories of collective support, such as the Denton Women‚Äôs Interracial Fellowship in Texas, which worked to desegregate their town. The narrative emphasizes the need to rekindle a spirit of kinship and neighborly concern to overcome societal divides.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist outlines six strategies for parents to foster trust with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, modeling behavior instead of interrogating, incorporating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies. The specialist emphasizes that trust is built through small, consistent actions and open communication. By implementing these practices, parents can create a safe and supportive environment where children feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and emotions.</p>

The US State Department has announced stricter screening and visa revocations for Chinese nationals, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred due to light scattering, tests showed that humans could recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, although critics note that existing night vision devices are more powerful.</p>
