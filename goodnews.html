          <p>A Chinese woman, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her involvement in a massive cryptocurrency money laundering scheme. Between 2014 and 2017, she orchestrated a scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims, converting the stolen funds into bitcoin. Following a seven-year investigation, UK authorities seized 61,000 bitcoins, valued at more than £5 billion, marking the largest crypto seizure in the country's history. Qian, who fled China and used false documents to enter the UK, pleaded guilty and now awaits sentencing for her role in the global operation.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive 20-point peace plan for the Gaza Strip, unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been presented to Hamas. The proposal mandates the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of a transitional government in Gaza. Key provisions also include an immediate halt to Israeli military operations, guarantees for unimpeded humanitarian aid, and a pathway toward a demilitarized Palestinian state. The international community, including several Arab nations, has expressed support for the initiative as it awaits a formal response from Hamas.</p>

          <p>A court in China has sentenced 11 members of the Ming crime family to death for running extensive scam and gambling operations from Laukkaing, a town in Myanmar near the Chinese border. Dozens of other family members received lengthy prison sentences, including life imprisonment, for crimes such as telecommunications fraud, drug trafficking, and murder. The criminal syndicate, which generated over $1.4 billion, was dismantled after an offensive by insurgent groups in Myanmar, leading to the arrest and extradition of its members to China. The harsh sentences signal Beijing's intensified crackdown on cross-border criminal enterprises.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to introduce an online NHS hospital service in England by 2027 to help alleviate extensive waiting lists. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the digital platform, accessible via the NHS app, will manage assessments, consultant check-ups, and follow-up appointments for specific conditions like ophthalmology and gynaecology. The initiative aims to deliver up to 8.5 million virtual appointments in its first three years, freeing up in-person resources for patients who need them most. While proponents highlight its potential for modernization and efficiency, critics raise concerns about digital exclusion and the sourcing of medical staff.</p>

          <p>Shares of Zijin Gold experienced a dramatic surge of over 60% during their first day of trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The Chinese mining company raised approximately $3.2 billion in its initial public offering, making it the second-largest IPO globally this year. The successful debut comes as gold prices have reached record highs, driven by global economic uncertainty and expectations of interest rate cuts. This listing is a significant boost for Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen a substantial resurgence in capital raising compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, citing persistent inflation, which recently hit its highest level in over a year. The move was widely anticipated by economists and follows a period of rate cuts earlier in the year aimed at curbing rising prices. In its statement, the RBA noted that inflation in the September quarter might be higher than previously forecast and highlighted uncertainty in the economic outlook. The central bank remains focused on its 2-3% inflation target while monitoring both domestic demand and global economic developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September was 49.8, indicating a sixth consecutive month of contraction but also the sector's strongest reading since March. The figure surpassed economists' expectations, suggesting that Beijing's efforts to manage industrial overcapacity may be having some effect. A separate private survey from RatingDog showed a more optimistic picture, with its PMI rising to 51.2, marking an expansion. Despite the slight uptick in production and new orders, the manufacturing sector continues to face challenges from weak domestic demand and ongoing global trade disruptions.

          <p>President Trump has presented a 20-point plan aimed at ending the Israel-Hamas war, which has received backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Governance of the territory would be transferred to an apolitical Palestinian committee overseen by an international stabilization force backed by the U.S. and Arab states. While the plan provides a detailed roadmap, its success hinges on Hamas's response and the resolution of several unanswered questions.</p>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the successful discount models of European chains like Aldi and Lidl. Amid an economic slowdown, these companies are reducing clutter, streamlining operations, and heavily promoting their own private-label brands to appeal to increasingly frugal shoppers. By offering quality comparable to name brands at lower prices, they aim to win back customers and combat flat sales. This strategic shift reflects a broader change in Chinese consumer behavior, with a growing demand for value-for-money products as economic uncertainty persists.</p>

The cubs underwent months of specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to ensure they did not become habituated. This rehabilitation is crucial for the near-threatened species, whose population in California is estimated to be between 3,200 and 4,500. The goal is for the young predators to thrive in their natural habitat and avoid conflicts with humans.</p>

Unlike last year, the Dodgers begin their playoff run with a healthy starting rotation, though their bullpen remains a question mark.
