          <p>A recent report indicates the Chinese yuan's international usage grew by approximately 11% in 2024, solidifying its position ahead of the British pound and Japanese yen. While the US dollar remains dominant, its influence has slightly decreased. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the rise of US-backed stablecoins is viewed as a potential threat to this expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon World zoo on the Isle of Wight has announced the successful birth of red panda twins, a significant event for the endangered species. The cubs were born on June 17 to a 10-year-old mother, Xiao, and a 10-month-old father, Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo as part of a breeding program. The zoo expressed its delight, noting the cubs are being monitored via CCTV and will remain in their nest box for about three months. The birth is a positive development in the conservation efforts for red pandas, which face threats from poaching and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>Despite forecasting a near tripling of its net profit for the first half of 2025, shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold have fallen for nine consecutive sessions. The company, known for its modern designs inspired by ancient craftsmanship, attributed its projected revenue and profit growth to successful online and offline expansion. However, analysts suggest the stock's decline is due to profit-taking by investors after a massive surge, along with concerns about rising gold prices and a reset in market expectations. The company's performance contrasts with more sluggish consumer spending in the broader Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Pete Buttigieg Argues Democrats Should Embrace Change, Not Just Restore the Pre-Trump Status Quo</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg cautioned the Democratic party against simply aiming to restore the political landscape that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that the pre-2025 status quo was already failing many Americans and that Democrats should embrace significant change rather than being "too attached" to failing institutions. Buttigieg also commented on the public's loss of trust in government, citing the continued interest in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as an example. He advocated for a "politics of courage" to counter what he sees as a growing politics of fear in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in 2026, Minnesota will require social media companies to display a pop-up warning to users before they log on, acknowledging the potential mental health hazards of prolonged use. The new law, the first of its kind in the nation, aims to encourage users, especially young people, to be more mindful of their online habits. While supporters compare the labels to warnings on tobacco and alcohol, tech industry groups like NetChoice oppose the measure, arguing it compels private companies to spread the state's message and may face legal challenges on free speech grounds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are highlighting that not all children respond to ultra-processed foods in the same way, with some having a naturally stronger "food reward drive." This disposition makes them more motivated to eat, less likely to feel full, and particularly vulnerable to overconsumption of highly engineered foods. Psychologists suggest that for these children, standard advice may not be effective. Instead, they recommend creating a safer home environment by limiting the availability of ultra-processed items and focusing on whole foods, while allowing for occasional treats in social settings.</p>

The discovery offers a direct, personal connection to the ancient craftspeople who are often overlooked in history, providing a unique glimpse into their lives and work.</p>
