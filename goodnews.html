          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market is defying the overall national slump, with wealthy buyers investing in luxury homes as value-preserving assets. A luxury development in Shanghai's core Huangpu district, One Central Park, sold all 64 units for 4 billion yuan (US$556 million). The project is developed by Sunac China Holdings, Citic Group, and Xinhu Group and has seen sales exceed 10.8 billion yuan year-to-date, making it the first residential project in China to surpass 10 billion yuan in 2025. New home prices in Shanghai have risen in April and May, outpacing national averages. </p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's eastern entrance, Tioga Road, will reopen on Memorial Day, after being closed since November due to ice and snow. The road's reopening is about two weeks earlier than last year, but cyclists will not be granted early access this year. Visitors planning to enter Yosemite between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. during the holiday weekend will need a reservation and should expect extended wait times. The park may face staffing shortages this year due to cuts at the National Park Service.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. The Dodgers' overworked bullpen and the performance of their starting pitcher, Tony Gonsolin, were key factors in the game. Gonsolin struggled in the fourth inning, issuing walks and allowing Soto to capitalize with his crucial hit. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, contributing to the Dodgers' offensive struggles.</p>
