          <p>Bill Gates has announced plans to donate the majority of his $200 billion fortune to Africa over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. Speaking at the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Gates emphasized his commitment to funding causes that improve health and education across the continent.

          <p>A rare 10-carat pink diamond, known as the Marie-Th√©r√®se Pink Diamond, with ties to Marie Antoinette, will be displayed and auctioned at Christie's Auction House in New York City. According to royal lore, the diamond was entrusted to Antoinette‚Äôs coiffeur before her attempted escape from Paris in 1791. The diamond resurfaced at auction in Geneva in 1996 and has remained out of public view until now. The piece is expected to sell for between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000, while a sapphire and diamond necklace, "The Blue Belle," is expected to lead the sale, estimated at $8,000,000 to $12,000,000.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that removing fluoride from public water supplies could lead to a substantial increase in tooth decay and dental care costs for children in the United States. The study, published in JAMA Health Forum, estimates that eliminating fluoride would result in 25.4 million additional cases of tooth decay and approximately $9.8 billion in costs over five years. The study emphasizes that publicly insured and uninsured children would be disproportionately affected. While fluoride is a common ingredient in toothpaste, drinking water remains a primary source of fluoride for many Americans.</p>

          <p>A decision coach who helps people make significant life choices in single sessions notes that many clients take too long to make decisions, exacerbating the difficulty. Lengthy decision-making processes add too many details, making it harder to weigh advantages and disadvantages effectively. This prolonged deliberation drains energy and mental space, negatively impacting overall well-being. The coach advises against overanalyzing and spending excessive time on decisions, as it often makes life demonstrably worse.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that following the MIND diet, even when started later in life, may significantly reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The MIND diet combines elements of the Mediterranean diet and DASH diet, emphasizing brain-healthy foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil. Participants who closely followed the MIND diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia, while those who improved their adherence over 10 years had a 25% lower risk. The study suggests that adopting a healthy diet can be beneficial for preventing dementia at any stage of life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. office market has reached an inflection point, with more office space being removed through conversions and demolitions than being added through new construction for the first time in at least 25 years. CBRE Group data indicates that 23.3 million square feet of office space is slated for demolition or conversion in the largest 58 U.S. markets by the end of the year, while only 12.7 million square feet of new office space is projected to be completed. This trend is driven by the shift in office attendance due to remote work, which has led to record-high vacancy rates.</p>
