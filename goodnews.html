          <p>JPMorgan Chase is in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card business from Goldman Sachs, which would further solidify its position as the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. The move would allow Goldman Sachs to exit its troubled foray into consumer credit cards, a venture that faced challenges with high growth rates and loan loss provisions. For Apple, this potential partnership shifts its high-profile credit card to a more established consumer banking giant. Other contenders like American Express and Barclays have reportedly dropped out of the bidding process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue, fueled by its highest airplane delivery numbers since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," citing improved stability in production and performance, though the company still faces challenges, including a delay in the certification of its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models. The aerospace giant has stabilized production of its 737 Max at the FAA's limit of 38 per month following intense scrutiny after a mid-air door plug incident. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has been openly pressuring Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, but economists widely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate to combat inflation, and despite the President's criticism, Powell has indicated no immediate cuts are necessary given the solid economy. With the labor market holding up and potential inflationary effects from new tariffs, policymakers are expected to remain cautious. Most analysts predict a potential rate cut is more likely at the September meeting, not this week. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a surge in U.S. imports as companies rushed to stock up before potential tariff hikes. The IMF now projects global growth of 3% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, an increase from its April predictions. However, the organization warned that this "front-loading" of trade creates risks, such as excess inventory, and that sustained high tariffs and uncertainty could still weaken future economic activity. The UK's growth forecast remained unchanged and is projected to be among the fastest of advanced economies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a record number of certificates of deposit (CDs) maturing this year, savers face a key decision on where to place their funds next. Experts advise against passively allowing a CD to auto-renew, as current interest rates may be lower than what could be found by shopping around. Instead, savers should assess their financial needs, considering whether they require liquidity, which might favor a high-yield savings account. Given that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates later this year, locking in a new 12-to-18-month CD now could be a smart move to secure a guaranteed high yield. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of the 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence that its society was centered around women. By analyzing DNA from skeletons buried under homes, researchers discovered that households were often formed on a matrilineal basis, with men moving in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence, combined with the finding that female graves contained significantly more burial goods than male ones, confirms long-held archaeological theories about the elevated status of women in this ancient community. The findings offer a fascinating glimpse into a prehistoric society with a social structure different from later patriarchal models.</p>

          <p>India is home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tiger population, with numbers on the rise, but conservationists warn of ongoing risks to their long-term survival. The primary threats are habitat fragmentation due to deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects, which isolates tiger populations and affects their movement and breeding. Human-wildlife conflict is also a major concern, particularly in areas where settlements and forests overlap. While India has implemented modern monitoring techniques and established numerous tiger reserves, experts stress that protecting the quality and connectivity of these habitats is crucial for a sustainable future for the species.</p>

          <p>A psychologist with over 20 years of experience outlines several common but potentially harmful statements that well-meaning parents tell their children. Phrases like "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" can create self-blame when things don't work out, while "big kids don't cry" can teach children to suppress valid emotions. The article suggests that these fibs and half-truths can negatively affect a child's resilience, emotional health, and ability to ask for help. Instead, parents are encouraged to be more realistic, validate all feelings, and teach a balanced approach to independence and self-care.</p>

          <p>A lead researcher who has studied hundreds of companies shifting to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three core strategies for a successful transition. The first is to increase productivity by shortening or eliminating meetings and protecting focused work time. The second involves re-engineering work processes to be more efficient, such as by optimizing the division of labor. Finally, successful companies re-evaluate their work to eliminate low-impact tasks and projects that are not aligned with their main goals. These changes have led to reduced burnout, higher engagement, and boosted profits for the businesses involved.</p>
