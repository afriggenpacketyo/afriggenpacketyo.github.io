        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and Russia have launched their first joint oceanographic expedition in five years, signaling renewed scientific cooperation with a focus on climate change and potential Arctic ambitions. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission to study the deep-sea environments of the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The research aims to understand the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems over the last 126,000 years. This collaboration marks a significant step in their bilateral marine research, framed by officials as a shared commitment to addressing global environmental challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed that the Trump administration's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision, stating that the proposed interpretation denying citizenship to many individuals born in the United States violates the Constitution. This ruling represents another significant legal obstacle for the administration's policy, which has faced multiple injunctions since its inception. The case reinforces the legal precedent of the 14th Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil, and moves the issue closer to a potential Supreme Court showdown.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Are Sufficient for Significant Health Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:27:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps per day can significantly reduce the risk of serious health issues like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research suggests this more attainable target could be more effective for public health than the widely-known but less evidence-based 10,000-step goal. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, not scientific research. Researchers believe that promoting a 7,000-step goal could encourage more people to track their activity and improve their overall health by providing a realistic and beneficial target.</p>

          <h2>Australian Women Win Right to Sue Qatar Airways Over Invasive Airport Searches</h2>

          <p>An Australian federal court has ruled that five women can proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways over invasive searches conducted at Doha's airport in 2020. The women were among a group ordered off a flight and subjected to physical examinations after a baby was found abandoned in a terminal restroom. A lower court had previously dismissed the case, arguing the airline was protected by international travel laws and could not have prevented the actions of Qatari police. This appeal victory overturns that decision, allowing the women to seek damages for alleged unlawful physical contact and false imprisonment.</p>

          <p>During a summit in Beijing marking 50 years of diplomatic relations, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the European Union to strengthen mutual trust and deepen cooperation. Addressing European Commission and Council presidents, Xi described China and the EU as "two big guys" on the world stage who must work together to provide global stability. The meeting occurs amid significant disagreements over trade, market access for EU firms, and industrial subsidies. Despite the tensions, Chinese state media emphasized that China is a "critical partner" to Europe, not a systemic rival, urging a focus on common ground.</p>

          <p>A rare, vibrant purple sea snail, known as Janthina janthina, was recently discovered on a La Jolla beach, an unusual sighting for Southern California. These snails typically inhabit warmer subtropical and tropical waters, staying afloat on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft. Researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, who had not seen the species locally in a decade, speculate that its appearance may be linked to warmer offshore waters moving toward the coast. While a direct connection to climate change is not confirmed, scientists will monitor for more sightings if ocean temperatures continue to rise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to strong global demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company anticipates this robust demand will continue, driven by ongoing AI investments from major tech firms and the proliferation of AI in consumer devices. SK Hynix plans to increase capital expenditure to maintain its leadership in the competitive HBM market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new UK law, part of the Online Safety Act, now requires websites with pornographic content to implement robust age verification systems to prevent access by minors. Methods approved by the regulator Ofcom include credit card checks, photo ID matching, and age estimation via selfie. Websites failing to comply face substantial fines of up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue. While the goal is to protect children, concerns remain about user privacy, data security, and the potential for users to circumvent these checks with tools like VPNs, posing an ongoing challenge for regulators.</p>

          <p>In a surprising reversal, former Red Sox designated hitter Rafael Devers stated he prefers playing a defensive position after making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants. Devers, who had previously been firm about wanting to be an exclusive DH in Boston, explained that being on the field keeps him more engaged in the game. This contrasts sharply with his stance during a tense spring training where he and Red Sox management appeared at odds over his role. His debut at first base for the Giants, during which he had two hits, marks a new chapter for the three-time All-Star.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of this growth. They warn that the externally facing economy could struggle if global trade softens under the threat of new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This perspective contrasts with other market experts who have urged Apple to make a major acquisition to accelerate its AI capabilities.
