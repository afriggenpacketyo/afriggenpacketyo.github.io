Intel's CEO welcomed the investment, highlighting a long-standing professional relationship, while SoftBank's founder emphasized the strategic importance of expanding advanced chip manufacturing within the United States. The investment aims to bolster Intel as its foundry business works to secure major clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could serve as an opportunity to geographically realign teams, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that grouping teams into divisions based on location, such as Eastern and Western Conferences, could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason formats. While this could face resistance from traditionalists, the commissioner argued it would optimize broadcast schedules for different time zones. Nashville and Salt Lake City are reported to be leading candidates for new expansion franchises.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit brought by Santa Clara County and other California jurisdictions. The lawsuit alleged that the company misled customers with its automatic renewal subscriptions and made the cancellation process difficult, in violation of state laws. While HelloFresh denies any wrongdoing, the settlement includes $6.38 million in civil penalties and $1 million in restitution for eligible California consumers who were unknowingly charged for subscriptions. The case was part of a broader effort by the state's Automatic Renewal Task Force to combat deceptive business practices.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old man named David Dickson has gone viral on social media for the remarkable results of a facelift he received in Guadalajara, Mexico.

          <h2>California Legislature Passes Bill Requiring Interest on Insurance Payouts to Homeowners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 18:11:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest accrued on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters. When insurers issue payments, funds are often held in an escrow account by the lender, where they can earn interest that banks typically keep. This new legislation mandates that homeowners will be guaranteed at least 2% simple interest on these funds. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, aims to close a loophole and provide additional financial support to residents during the difficult process of rebuilding their homes.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the South China Morning Post explores the implications of China's plan to build a large new embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London. The article argues that the project is a powerful symbol of China's rising global status and its long-term commitment to its relationship with the United Kingdom. While the proposal has faced some political opposition over security concerns, the author suggests that a significant diplomatic presence can foster stronger ties in finance, trade, and diplomacy. The piece frames the dispute as a microcosm of the complex UK-China relationship and a test of Britain's international standing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has accepted the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt and Qatar. The deal is said to be based on a U.S. framework and involves an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. Israel's official response remains unclear, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously demanded the release of all hostages at once. The development comes amid intensifying Israeli military operations in Gaza City and increasing domestic pressure in Israel to secure a deal.</p>
