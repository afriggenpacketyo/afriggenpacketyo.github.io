        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume increased by 12.5% last week, reaching the highest level in over a month, after adjustments for the Memorial Day holiday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances increased slightly to 6.93%, while refinance applications rose 16% and purchase applications climbed 10% year-over-year. The increase in purchase applications may be attributed to a loosening housing inventory, with supply being approximately 31% higher than the previous year, and home prices starting to ease. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers appear to be taking advantage of the increased inventory, but upcoming inflation data and trade talks with China could influence bond markets.

          <p>The article explores the evolving role of friendship in a culture that often prioritizes romantic relationships, examining how friendships can be as significant and intimate as marriage. Historically, friendships were highly valued, with Renaissance-era men living alongside their friends and women expressing passionate affection for each other, but societal norms have shifted, placing romantic partners at the forefront. This hierarchy of connection can lead to feelings of loss when friends enter romantic relationships, and the article suggests reimagining free time to include friends and prioritizing both love and friendship. The piece highlights that close friendships can be better for mental health than romantic relationships, emphasizing the importance of encouraging connections outside of romantic partnerships. </p>

          <p>The article explores the idea of "recession pop," upbeat music from the time of the Great Recession, and whether music can predict economic downturns. Experts suggest that while there was plenty of upbeat music during uncertain times, music of all kinds existed, making the genre a slippery one. The article suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more about millennials aging out of being cool and asserting their cultural power. The author concludes that recession pop is a made-up term that represents a lot of different kinds of music and was only recently coined. </p>

Smoking has long been associated with French culture, from literary figures like Meursault in Camus's *The Stranger* to iconic actors and artists. The author reflects on their own experience of learning to smoke in Paris, linking it to the idea of pressing "pause" and savoring moments of idleness. While acknowledging the health risks of smoking, the article suggests that it represents a cultural preference for leisure and enjoyment, potentially threatened by the ban. </p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe are experiencing a rebound in 2025, with over 2.2 million electrified vehicles registered from January to April, marking a 20% surge compared to the previous year. While factors such as advances in battery range and expanded charging infrastructure contribute, the primary driver is a January 1 EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15%. Public enthusiasm for EVs, however, isn't growing as fast as policymakers would like, and charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier, while Chinese brands are gaining ground due to heavy state subsidies. Despite the recovery, challenges such as consumer skepticism and competition persist. </p>

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees across several divisions, including its knowledge and information, central engineering, marketing, research, and communications units, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are mandating office returns for remote workers near an office. Google executive Nick Fox stated that employees who are not meeting expectations may want to take the buyout, while those performing well should remain with the company. The buyouts come as Google expands its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and focuses on cost-cutting measures. </p>
