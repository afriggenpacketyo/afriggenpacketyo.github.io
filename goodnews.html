        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional investors. According to CoinShares, broader macro concerns, such as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, further fueled Bitcoin's rally as investors sought alternative stores of value. This price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, indicating a potential divergence from its typical correlation with equity markets. Investors may be viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability, contributing to its continued appeal and value. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing in April was higher than anticipated, reaching £20.2 billion, which is £1 billion more than the borrowing figure from April of the previous year. According to the Office for National Statistics, this borrowing figure represents the difference between government spending and tax income. Analysts had predicted a borrowing figure of £17.9 billion, making the actual amount higher than expected. This April's borrowing marks the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993, signaling potential challenges in the UK's fiscal management.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues during ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement implies that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is not a significant concern in trade talks, differing from President Trump's previous stance on Japan's trade deficit. Meanwhile, Japan has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy to reduce prices by 10 yen per liter, aiming to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The BOJ also indicated it would take a cautious approach on raising short-term interest rates.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, are expected to continue their rally, which has already seen gains of nearly 80% this year, as the company introduces new models and progresses towards profitability. Xpeng's shares in Hong Kong increased significantly after reporting strong earnings and an optimistic revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, and its net loss narrowed, improving its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, supported by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after winning the general election, the Labour government is attempting to highlight its achievements while blaming the Conservatives for current challenges. The government points to the handover of the Chagos Islands and the sentencing review as examples of Conservative failures. However, this strategy raises questions about the diminishing returns of blaming the predecessor government as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office. Meanwhile, the Justice Secretary is considering mandatory chemical castration for sexual assault offenders, and new data on net migration is expected.</p>

However, tax experts note that the accounts function similarly to typical investment accounts, with post-tax contributions and taxed gains, rather than offering tax advantages like IRAs or HSAs.
