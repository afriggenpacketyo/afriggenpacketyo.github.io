          <p>New Zealand's All Blacks have secured the Bledisloe Cup for the 23rd consecutive year after a 33-24 victory against Australia's Wallabies in Auckland. Despite a strong start from the All Blacks, Australia mounted a significant comeback, narrowing the score to within three points in the final ten minutes. However, a late try by Cam Roigard sealed the win for New Zealand, extending their unbeaten streak at Eden Park. The victory also places the All Blacks at the top of the Rugby Championship standings ahead of the final matches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are significantly shaping the design of a new generation of towns in England. Government plans for 12 new towns emphasize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" with traditional housing styles like terraces, echoing the King's own projects like Poundbury. Architectural experts note that the King's views, once criticized by the architectural establishment, have now become mainstream, with a greater focus on creating community-oriented and aesthetically pleasing public spaces. These new developments aim to learn from the mistakes of post-war towns by prioritizing human-centric design over car-dependent layouts.</p>

          <p>China is turning its focus to advancements in women's rights as it prepares to host a global summit on the topic, expected to take place in October. A foreign ministry spokesperson stated that China is not only an advocate but also an "active actor" in promoting gender equality and women's development. The statement comes as two new books by President Xi Jinping were published, featuring speeches on issues from gender equality to traditional family values. While international officials are expected to attend the summit, sources suggest domestic grassroots NGOs may not be invited unless sponsored by overseas entities.</p>

          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers, Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, who were killed in the Battle of Loos during World War I, have been identified over 100 years after their deaths. The discovery was made at a construction site in northern France, leading to a meticulous investigation by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the UK's Ministry of Defence "war detectives." Investigators used artifacts, including regimental badges and distinctive tramway buttons found with one soldier, along with genealogical research and DNA testing with living relatives, to confirm the identities, bringing closure to their families.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, pilots from commercial companies and civilian networks were among the first to witness the widespread destruction and conduct rescue missions. These volunteers flew hundreds of missions, initially rescuing stranded residents and later airlifting essential supplies like medicine and food. Their efforts, coordinated with groups like the United Cajun Navy, were vital in the first days before larger-scale aid from organizations like the National Guard could fully mobilize.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the Brazilian Amazon have captured unprecedented footage of a black-coated jaguar mating with a spotted jaguar in the wild, a behavior previously observed only in captivity. The rare six-minute video was recorded by trail cameras in the Serra do Pardo National Park as part of a broader biodiversity study. Researchers described the discovery as hitting the "proverbial jackpot," as jaguars are solitary and elusive, making them difficult to study. This unique observation provides valuable insights into the natural behavior of the species, which is essential for improving conservation and breeding programs worldwide.</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of navigating the immense pressure of failure and finding new paths to success. Entrepreneurs describe the emotional toll of shutting down a business, which can involve disappointing investors, laying off employees, and facing a personal identity crisis. While some recruiters exhibit an "entrepreneurship penalty," many former founders find that the skills they developed, such as multitasking and a holistic understanding of business operations, make them highly effective employees. The article suggests that reframing failure and focusing on a deep sense of purpose are key to building resilience and bouncing back.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada puts a spotlight on the significant financial gap in the sport. England's team is the best-funded in the world, with 32 full-time professional players and a robust domestic league, backed by millions in investment from the Rugby Football Union. In contrast, the Canadian team relies on a fraction of that funding, with players earning minimal amounts and the national body launching a fundraising drive to cover World Cup costs. Despite this disparity, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, raising questions about whether their success could inadvertently discourage other unions from investing in full-time professionalism.</p>

Many other players, including a former primary school teacher and a painter/decorator, have transitioned from day jobs to full-time contracts in recent years. Their stories highlight the dedication required before the women's game was able to offer professional opportunities, a stark contrast to their amateur past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow young people aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, which Reeves argues would be beneficial for growth and business. The Chancellor is also pushing for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of such a deal into its official forecasts. This could potentially reduce the need for future spending cuts or tax increases to fill a projected fiscal gap. (not investment advice)</p>
