          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, former executives of the sexual wellness company OneTaste, have been convicted of forced labor conspiracy. They were found guilty of manipulating young women into performing degrading sex acts for the company's benefit, including sexually servicing potential investors. Prosecutors accused the executives of recruiting people with prior trauma and subjecting them to constant surveillance and intimidation. Daedone and Cherwitz face up to 20 years in prison for their crimes, which involved coercing employees into working long hours with little to no pay and intimidating them into financial ruin to pay for expensive OneTaste courses and retreats. This is a victory for the victims of sexual assault.</p>

Concerns exist that such deployment could violate federal law. This decision follows testimony from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. Hegseth and President Trump have defended the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, despite objections from Democrats.

This offering signals a loosening in the fintech IPO market after a years-long freeze, as rising interest rates and valuation resets kept many late-stage companies on the sidelines.

The two had a public fallout after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had previously claimed, without evidence, that Trump appeared in unreleased government files linked to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
