A preliminary vote count shows strong support for incorporating the area into its own city, but the project has raised concerns about SpaceX's control over the area and potential limitations on public access to Boca Chica Beach. The proposed municipality would have the power to create its own fire department, emergency services, and even a school district. SpaceX has asked the FAA for permits that would allow SpaceX to launch up to 25 times a year.</p>
