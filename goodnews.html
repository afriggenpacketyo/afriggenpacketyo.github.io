          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 275,000 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs from 2022-2024 due to a potentially bent front brake line that could lead to brake failure. The issue stems from a faulty assembly process during engine installation at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant. A brake line leak may cause longer brake pedal travel and reduce deceleration, increasing the risk of a crash. Ford will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe at no cost to owners, with notifications mailed starting May 26, 2025.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year, surpassing expectations due to strong spending on services like retail and hospitality. This growth rate is the highest among G7 countries, despite global trade shocks from US tariffs. However, economists caution that this growth may not last, as the full impact of US tariffs is yet to be felt and tax increases could dampen consumer spending. While the UK-US tariff deal offers some relief, its effects remain uncertain.</p>
