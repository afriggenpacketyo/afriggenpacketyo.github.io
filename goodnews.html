          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba championed the importance of maintaining the global economic order and reducing trade barriers at the G7 summit in Canada, amidst rising concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral approach to trade. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world. Trump reiterated his discontent with Russia's exclusion from the group and suggested the inclusion of China. The summit was also impacted by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, prompting Trump to leave early, while G7 leaders called for de-escalation and affirmed support for Israel's security. The article reflects the challenges in achieving consensus on global issues due to differing agendas among G7 nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts indicate a resurgence in China's private sector as regulatory restrictions are relaxed to encourage technological advancements and international expansion. Investment patterns signal a renewed focus on capital expenditure, overseas growth, research, and fundraising. The report highlights the private sector's significant contribution to China's GDP, urban employment, and tax revenue, despite receiving a smaller share of bank loans. Beijing's support for the private sector is seen as crucial for economic momentum amid growing competition with the United States. The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order implementing parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The deal allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the previously imposed 25% import tax. While the order addresses car tariffs and aerospace products, it does not include the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government aims to further reduce tariffs on core steel products, but technical details are still being worked out due to Tata Steel's import of steel from overseas during its transition to electric furnace operations.</p>
