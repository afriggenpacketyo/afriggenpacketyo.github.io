          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to support the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a comprehensive tax bill passed by the House. The White House is mounting an "all-out advocacy effort," with administration officials pressuring senators to agree to the bill's broad contours. Sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, with Trump assuring no Medicaid benefit cuts would occur. The Senate must approve changes made by the House, and the House must accept any changes made by the Senate due to the Byrd rule.</p>

Trump claims the bill will unleash American energy, protect children, and kick millions of illegals off Medicaid.

The administration is committed to protecting Social Security recipients who often rely on a fixed income. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default on their federal student loans and likely to be receiving Social Security benefits. The administration's reprieve gives older student borrowers more time to try to get current, and to avoid a reduced benefit check down the line. (not investment advice)</p>
