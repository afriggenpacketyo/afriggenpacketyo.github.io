          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amid EV Battery Boom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. Despite facing scrutiny from the U.S. and EU due to trade tensions and alleged military links, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year over year, though annual revenue dropped slightly due to intense competition in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war initiated by former U.S. President Donald Trump. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift away from U.S. dollar assets, driven by China's economic recovery and a weaker U.S. dollar. Bank of America analysts noted that the U.S. downgrade and bond yield increases signal a favorable environment for emerging markets like China.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is launching offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, reducing reliance on forests for CO2 capture.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 22:03:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move aims to stimulate the economy, supported by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. State-backed commercial lenders also reduced deposit rates to protect their net interest margins, paving the way for lower lending rates. Economists anticipate further policy easing by the PBOC, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new EU deal reminds us of the UK's uneasy relationship with its neighbors, existing both as members and non-members of the European Union. The government calls it a "reset," but this resetting is likely permanent, with the current trajectory leaning toward a closer relationship. However, some Brexiteers find parts thin and oversold, seeing it as a breach of a crucial principle: accepting "dynamic alignment" in some areas. This trade-off involves making trade easier at the expense of handing over some power.</p>

          <p>The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill, the GENIUS Act, after overcoming initial Democratic opposition related to concerns about the Trump family's ties to the digital asset industry. The bill aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to assets like the U.S. dollar. Despite some Democratic holdouts, the measure gained support after negotiations, with Senator Mark Warner calling it a "meaningful step forward." However, Senator Elizabeth Warren continues to oppose the bill, citing consumer risks and corruption concerns.</p>
