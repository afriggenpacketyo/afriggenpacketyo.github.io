          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly interested in returning to the moon, driven by the moon's abundant resources and its potential as a base for missions to Mars. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole, while China and Russia plan to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, could be used to make lunar bases self-sufficient and provide fuel for spacecraft. Scientific research on the moon will also focus on understanding lunar environments and developing technologies that benefit life on Earth. </p>
