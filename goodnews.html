          <p>A UK Education Select Committee report has strongly recommended against scrapping the individual care plans, known as EHCPs, for children with special educational needs. The committee of MPs also called for new national minimum standards for special needs support in schools and increased training for all teachers. This recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) system, which has faced financial sustainability challenges despite a rising number of children requiring support. Parent campaign groups have voiced strong opposition to any changes that might weaken the legal protections afforded by the current plans.</p>

The company, which will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker "NTSK," raised $908.2 million in the offering. This IPO comes during a recent resurgence in market activity after a prolonged quiet period, with other tech companies like Klarna and CoreWeave also recently going public. Founded in 2012, Netskope provides IT security and networking services, competing with major players like Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler in a sector seeing increased dealmaking.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Atletico Madrid 3-2 in their Champions League opener with a dramatic stoppage-time winner from captain Virgil van Dijk. The match at Anfield saw Liverpool take an early 2-0 lead before Atletico fought back to equalize, continuing a trend of late-game heroics for the English club this season. The game also marked the debut of Liverpool's record £125 million signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs of linking up with new playmaker Florian Wirtz despite looking rusty. Manager Arne Slot celebrated the victory but expressed a desire for his team to secure wins more comfortably in the future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump praised the "special relationship" between the United States and the United Kingdom during a lavish state visit hosted by King Charles. The trip featured extensive royal pageantry, including a military welcome and a formal banquet at Windsor Castle, which Trump described as a great honor. While the visit aims to strengthen economic ties, with billions in tech investments already pledged, it was also met with significant public opposition, as thousands of protestors marched in London. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hopes the visit will yield further progress on trade and geopolitical issues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:09:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This decision would follow the Bank's previous rate cut in August and comes a day after the US Federal Reserve also lowered its key interest rate. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the target rate, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut this year. The stability of the Bank rate has a significant impact on borrowing costs for consumers, particularly for new fixed-rate mortgages, which have seen slight decreases recently.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time in 2025, reducing it by 25 basis points to align with the recent decision by the US Federal Reserve. This move is intended to lower the cost of funding for businesses and ease the financial burden on mortgage holders in the city. The US Federal Reserve justified its rate cut by pointing to a softening labor market, a shift from its previous stance. The coordinated action was widely anticipated by markets and is seen as the beginning of a potential cycle of rate cuts extending into the next year.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate by a Quarter Point Amid Mixed Economic Signals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 17:24:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, bringing it to a target range of 4%-4.25% in a widely expected move. The central bank's updated forecast, or "dot plot," signals the possibility of two more cuts before the end of the year but a more cautious approach in subsequent years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut, balancing a weaker labor market against persistent inflation. The mixed signals from the Fed, combining short-term dovishness with a longer-term hawkish outlook, led to an uneven reaction in the financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>
