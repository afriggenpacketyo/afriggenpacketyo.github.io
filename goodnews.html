          <p>The United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, has revealed he is actively lobbying for the NFL's Super Bowl to be held in Britain for the first time. Mandelson expressed his strong desire for the event to be announced during his tenure, highlighting the UK's love for American football. This effort is supported by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who believes hosting the game would cement London's status as a global sports capital. The NFL has held regular-season games in London since 2007, but the Super Bowl has never been played outside the U.S.</p>

Trump framed the talks as a significant early step in resolving the nearly four-year-long war, with key administration officials coordinating the logistics. European leaders present at the White House emphasized the critical need for robust, NATO-like security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure a lasting peace. While progress was noted, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson rejected any scenarios involving a NATO military presence in Ukraine, highlighting ongoing diplomatic challenges.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 18:11:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill requiring mortgage lenders to pay homeowners at least 2% interest on insurance payouts held in escrow after a natural disaster. The legislation addresses a loophole where lenders could deposit insurance funds into an account and keep the accrued interest while homeowners waited for the money to be released for rebuilding. Authored by Assemblymember John Harabedian and sponsored by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill aims to provide additional financial support to residents recovering from events like the state's recent wildfires. The new law will apply to both new and existing escrow accounts holding disaster-related insurance funds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a high-stakes meeting at the White House, top European leaders pressed President Trump to secure a ceasefire from Russia as a precondition for advancing peace negotiations with Ukraine. Leaders from Germany, France, and others emphasized that future talks would be untenable without a halt to the fighting, urging Trump to "put pressure on Russia." This united European front emerged following concerns sparked by Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where the U.S. president appeared to back away from demanding an immediate ceasefire. The meeting highlighted a potential divergence in strategy between the U.S. and its European allies on the path to resolving the war.</p>

          <p>Iowa Democratic state Representative J.D. Scholten has suspended his campaign for the 2026 U.S. Senate primary. In his announcement, he endorsed fellow Democratic Representative Josh Turek, calling him the "best hope" to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Joni Ernst. The move consolidates some of the Democratic field in a race to unseat Ernst, who has not yet formally announced her bid for a third term but is actively fundraising. The development comes as Republicans face challenges in other key 2026 Senate races, making the Iowa contest significant for maintaining the party's majority control.</p>

With four wins in five matches, the team is now in a strong position to secure a spot in the final stages of the competition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:51:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatar mediators. The plan is reportedly based on a U.S. framework and would involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The deal would also include negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict. Israel's response remains uncertain, as the prime minister's office previously stated it would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once. The development comes amid intensified Israeli military operations in Gaza City.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Can Buy Now, Pay Later Debt Be Included in Forgiveness Programs?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:46:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether debt from popular "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services can be managed through debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans are technically eligible, similar to credit card or personal loan debt. However, their inclusion is not guaranteed, as these services are relatively new and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements with debt relief companies. The article notes that with defaults on BNPL plans rising, consumers should be aware that unpaid debt can be sold to collectors. It also suggests alternative strategies for managing this debt, such as direct negotiation with the provider or debt consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>
