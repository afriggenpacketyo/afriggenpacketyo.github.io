          <p>A federal judge in Boston has delivered a significant ruling stating that the Trump administration unconstitutionally targeted non-citizens for deportation based on their political speech. The 161-page decision emphasized that First Amendment rights are not limited by citizenship status, citing the case of a Tufts University student arrested by ICE after co-authoring an op-ed about the war in Gaza. The judge condemned the practice, asserting that the nation must not imprison or deport people for expressing their views. This ruling is seen as a major vindication of free speech protections for immigrants.</p>

          <p>In a rare television event, late-night hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert appeared as guests on each other's shows on the same night. The crossover was a display of solidarity and humor amidst recent pressures on their programs, which they attribute to the political climate. Kimmel discussed his show's temporary suspension by ABC, while Colbert shared the story of how he learned his own show on CBS was being canceled. The hosts used the unique format to trade stories, mock President Trump, and toast to their friendship and the world of late-night television.</p>

          <p>In response to increasing airspace violations and security threats, several European nations are proposing the creation of a "drone wall" along the continent's eastern flank. This initiative would not be a physical barrier but a coordinated counter-drone system designed to detect, track, and intercept unauthorized drones, particularly those suspected to be from Russia. The proposal is strongly supported by Baltic and Eastern European states as a way to bolster collective defense. However, the project faces significant financial, technical, and geopolitical hurdles before it can be realized.</p>

          <p>Mike Minogue, a Republican combat veteran and former CEO of the medical device company Abiomed, has announced his candidacy for governor of Massachusetts. In his campaign launch, Minogue positioned himself as a problem-solver aiming to challenge the state's Democratic-controlled government, which he argues has left working people behind. His platform focuses on lowering taxes, improving the economy, and expanding educational options. Minogue joins a growing field of Republican candidates seeking to unseat the incumbent Democratic governor, Maura Healey, in the traditionally blue state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Andrew Puzder, has identified creating a joint U.S.-EU strategy on China as a top diplomatic priority. Speaking at an Atlantic Council event, Puzder stressed the importance of a shared recognition of the strategic and economic threats posed by Beijing. While acknowledging existing policy differences between the U.S. and EU on matters like digital regulation, he indicated that aligning on China is crucial. This push for a common front underscores the growing consensus in Western capitals about the need to collectively address challenges from China.</p>

          <h2>The Etymology of 'Hoax' Traced Back to 'Hocus Pocus' and 17th-Century Magic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" has a fascinating origin, evolving directly from the magical incantation "hocus pocus." Linguistic analysis traces the phrase to the stage name of a popular 17th-century English magician, William Vincent, who used it during his tricks. One theory suggests Vincent created the phrase as a satirical corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum." Over time, "hocus pocus" became synonymous with trickery, and its shortened form, "hoax," emerged around 1800 to describe a grander, more elaborate deception.</p>

          <p>The small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, has successfully transformed its local legend of the Mothman into a major economic driver. The annual Mothman Festival, celebrating the mysterious winged creature reportedly sighted in 1966, now attracts over 20,000 visitors, injecting millions of dollars into the local economy. What began as a small gathering has grown into a large-scale event with vendors, music, and guest speakers, revitalizing the town's downtown and putting it on the map for paranormal tourism. This has brought new life and business to a community of fewer than 5,000 residents.</p>

          <p>New data from the trade body UK Finance indicates a major shift in payment habits, with half of all adults in the UK now regularly using mobile payments. Services like Apple Pay and Google Pay saw a surge in usage across all age groups in the past year, with adoption being most prevalent among those aged 16 to 24. This growing comfort with paying via smartphone or watch has led to a slight decrease in the use of physical contactless cards. Despite the trend towards digital, campaigners emphasize the need to maintain cash access for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The world of women's football is experiencing unprecedented financial growth, with the world transfer record being broken five times in 2025 alone. This surge in spending, primarily from clubs in England's Women's Super League and the US's NWSL, signals a new era of commercial investment in the sport. However, this rapid escalation is also creating a significant financial gap between the top leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga. Experts warn that this could lead to a concentration of talent in a few elite clubs, threatening competitive balance across the globe.</p>

The central bank is currently evaluating the economic effects of a significant 50-basis-point rate cut implemented in June. While inflation has shown signs of moderation, the RBI governor noted that global trade uncertainties could potentially slow down economic growth in the second half of the fiscal year. This pause allows the Monetary Policy Committee more time to observe unfolding economic trends. (not investment advice)</p>

The new restrictions, which apply to supermarkets and other large retailers, had been delayed due to cost-of-living concerns but are now in effect. Health officials argue these deals encourage over-consumption and do not save consumers money in the long run.
