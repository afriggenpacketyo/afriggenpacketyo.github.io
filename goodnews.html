        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House, through press secretary Karoline Leavitt, has strongly condemned federal judges for impeding President Trump's ability to enact global tariffs, a central element of his second-term agenda. Leavitt described the court rulings as "judicial overreach" and emphasized the need for the Supreme Court to intervene to safeguard the Constitution and the country's credibility on the international stage. She highlighted the Senate's rejection of a bipartisan effort to block Trump's tariffs, arguing that the courts should not interfere. The administration is exploring alternative legal avenues to implement Trump's tariff policies, while still adhering to court orders. Optimism is moderate as the administration seeks to navigate legal challenges to its trade policies.</p>

The national average savings account interest rate is 0.42%, but high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Online banks often provide the best high-yield options due to lower overhead costs, and comparing different accounts is essential to find the most beneficial rates and terms. Maximizing savings through high-yield accounts can significantly increase earnings over time, providing a better financial safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Radio host and opera singer Wynne Evans has announced his departure from his BBC Radio Wales show after the broadcaster decided not to renew his contract. This follows an apology Evans made for an "inappropriate and unacceptable" comment during the launch of the Strictly Come Dancing live tour in December. Evans, known for his role in the Go Compare adverts, expressed his disappointment but also announced the launch of a new online radio show. The article also references other incidents involving Evans during his time on Strictly Come Dancing, including a perceived awkward moment with Katya Jones, which both parties later dismissed as a joke.

          <p>Brood XIV cicadas have begun emerging from underground in several U.S. states, including Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of Georgia and Illinois. This emergence, occurring every 17 years, involves billions of cicadas surfacing as the soil warms to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. While the current emergence is limited to Brood XIV, experts assure that cicadas are harmless to humans and pets, and beneficial to the ecosystem, serving as food for birds and aerating soil.

Consumer spending slowed to a 0.2% increase, while personal income surged by 0.8%, exceeding forecasts.

          <p>Costco reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, with sales increasing by 8% year-over-year; however, shares fell slightly despite the positive results. The company's leaders discussed the challenges and increased costs resulting from tariffs during an earnings call. Costco's CFO, Gary Millerchip, noted that about a third of U.S. sales are from imported goods, with 8% originating from China. While some retailers are raising prices due to tariffs, Costco is attempting to mitigate these costs by sourcing more private-brand items locally and absorbing some cost differences. The company's approach to managing tariffs and maintaining competitive prices could benefit from increased consumer traffic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores two acronyms influencing investment strategies in response to President Trump's tariff policies: "Taco" (Trump always chickens out) and "Tina" (there is no alternative). Taco trades involve selling assets when Trump threatens high tariffs and rebuying them when he backs down, capitalizing on market fluctuations. Conversely, Tina reflects the belief that U.S. assets remain the best investment option despite policy uncertainties. The S&P 500's reaction to Trump's tariff announcements illustrates the dynamics of Taco trades, while the continued investment in U.S. assets underscores the Tina mentality. The market appetite depends on an investor's perception of Trump's policy consistency.</p>

This dismissal coincides with a shift in the political landscape, as the Trump administration is taking steps to demonstrate support for the crypto industry. Binance has forged new partnerships, including one with World Liberty Financial, signaling a change in the regulatory environment for digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zhou Zhongpeng, a former Peking University doctoral student turned tech engineer, has made a breakthrough in deciphering Shinichi Mochizuki's Inter-universal Teichmueller Theory (IUT). This theory, known for its complexity and alien-like notation, has baffled mathematicians since its introduction in 2012. Zhou's work may transform the ABC conjecture, a significant problem in number theory, from a conceptual idea into a computationally usable tool. Professor Ivan Fesenko, a leading IUT authority, praised Zhou's results as stronger than Andrew Wiles‚Äô proof of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. The accomplishment highlights the potential for innovation outside traditional academic settings.</p>

          <h2>Are We Misinterpreting Machiavelli's Intentions?</h2>

          <p>The article questions the common interpretation of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, suggesting that his famous work, The Prince, may be a veiled critique of authoritarian power rather than a manual for tyrants. Political philosopher Erica Benner argues that Machiavelli was a republican who valued shared power and warned against the dangers of inequality and partisanship. The article explores whether Machiavelli's writings offer insights into contemporary politics, particularly in the context of leaders who challenge established institutions. The author suggests that a nuanced understanding of Machiavelli reveals a more complex and relevant perspective on power and governance.</p>
