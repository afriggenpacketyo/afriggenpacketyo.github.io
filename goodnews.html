          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has officially formed over the central Atlantic, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center expect Gabrielle to intensify into a hurricane by Sunday, though its current trajectory is projected to remain over open waters, passing north of the Caribbean and potentially east of Bermuda next week. While there are no immediate land hazards, Bermuda may experience some impacts early next week. This season has been quieter than initially predicted by the NOAA, which had anticipated a more active period for named storms and hurricanes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping engaged in a crucial call aimed at finalizing a deal to prevent TikTok from being shut down in the United States. This discussion follows a "framework" agreement established earlier this week, offering a pathway for ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to avoid a federal mandate requiring divestment of its American operations. President Trump, a vocal supporter of TikTok, has consistently extended the divestment deadline, emphasizing the platform's significant value. The ongoing negotiations reflect efforts to balance national security concerns, raised by bipartisan lawmakers regarding foreign influence, with the platform's widespread popularity and economic impact.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris experienced a significant setback during Friday practice at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, crashing his McLaren at Turn Four and sustaining rear suspension damage, which prematurely ended his session. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton led a dominant Ferrari performance, securing a one-two finish with Charles Leclerc. This messy session for McLaren also saw Norris's teammate, Oscar Piastri, brush the wall, though without significant damage. Norris is currently focused on reducing the 31-point championship lead held by Piastri, as McLaren vies for its second consecutive constructors' championship this weekend.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has announced that the agency will propose a rule change concerning corporate earnings reports, following President Donald Trump's suggestion to transition from quarterly to semiannual reporting. Atkins expressed support for the concept, believing that the market should ultimately determine the appropriate reporting frequency for companies. Current regulations mandate quarterly disclosures for publicly traded entities. Proponents argue that less frequent reporting would enable companies to prioritize long-term strategic goals, while opponents raise concerns about reduced transparency for investors. The SEC, with a Republican majority, is poised to consider this significant regulatory shift.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban for nearly eight months, have been released through Qatari mediation. Their family expressed "immense joy and relief" at the news, acknowledging the power of diplomacy and international cooperation in securing their freedom. The couple, who had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years running charitable programs, were arrested on February 1st, with the Taliban citing unspecified violations of Afghan law. Concerns had been raised about their deteriorating health during detention. They are now en route to Qatar for medical evaluation before returning to the UK.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari expressed his expectation for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the recent one, totaling three for 2025. He believes President Trump's tariffs will exert only minimal long-term pressure on inflation, thereby creating room for further monetary easing. Kashkari's dovish outlook is also influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation levels exceeding the Fed's 2% target. He clarified that while these factors support rate reductions, the central bank is not satisfied with 3% inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly employing a "tariff arbitrage" strategy, dubbed "tariff hacking," to navigate President Trump's trade war and maintain stable consumer prices. This involves utilizing wholesale middlemen, or a B2B2C model, where a U.S. entity acts as the merchant of record, purchasing products at wholesale prices and paying tariffs on this lower value. This innovative approach has reportedly halved tariff costs for some retailers, enabling them to safeguard profit margins and avoid price increases for customers. While seen as a clever adaptation, some logistics experts caution that this method might only offer short-term relief and could potentially lead to future compliance issues or inflationary pressures.

While some analyses forecast a significant drop in China's population to approximately 1.12 billion by the end of the century, this article questions the severity of such predictions. It highlights that similar drastic declines are projected for Russia, whereas the United States is expected to see substantial population growth, without clear justifications for these disparities. Alternative forecasts from Chinese universities suggest a more moderate scenario, indicating China's population could stabilize around 1.12 billion, challenging the more gloomy outlooks.</p>
