          <p>Double the number of households in Britain will get ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules on who qualifies for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification about property size, type and home energy score is being scrapped. As a result this winter 2.7 million more homes will get this extra energy bill help, including almost a million households with children. The bill for expanding the Warm Home Discount will be paid by energy companies and could be passed on through the standing charge, so it is possible all customers will see a slight increase in bills in the autumn to cover this announcement.

          <p>Adam Ratcliffe, a former engineer, has joined three ex-Royal Marines in an attempt to break the world record for rowing across the North Atlantic, aiming to raise awareness and funds for veterans' mental health. The team, "Team United We Conquer," plans to depart from New Jersey and reach the British Isles of Scilly in under 43 days. The team aims to raise ¬£50,000 for Head Up, a mental health charity benefiting the British armed forces community. The journey is not without risk, as the North Atlantic is less frequently traversed than the Mid-Atlantic, and people have died attempting this route.</p>

          <p>Students should be ready to be shocked and offended at university, according to Arif Ahmed from the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS has published guidance for universities in England on how a new law, designed to protect free speech, will work when it comes into force from August. Ahmed told the BBC that exposure to views which students might find offensive was "part of the process of education". The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities in England to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>People across the country are celebrating Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the end of slavery in the United States after the Civil War. Communities have paid homage to that date for well over a century, with the earliest documented Juneteenth celebrations dating back to the first anniversary of emancipation in Galveston, Texas. Juneteenth became a U.S. holiday under the Biden administration in 2021. The article provides a series of photographs showcasing various Juneteenth celebrations across the country.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that SiriusXM Holdings is poised to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years. The satellite radio leader's subscriber base peaked in 2019 and isn't heading in the right direction, with a decrease of about 303,000 self-pay subscribers in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Profitability is also heading in the wrong direction, with free cash slow down by about 33% over the past two full years. The first phase of SiriusXM's turnaround plan was mainly focused on cost reduction, and after a couple of years, the company has done a great job in this area. (not investment advice)</p>

Temperatures will widely be between 27C and 30C on Thursday across east Wales, the Midlands, and East and South East England with a few locations around Greater London and the home counties reaching 31C.</p>

          <p>Samsung is planning to launch a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold6, to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have released thinner and lighter devices. Slimness has become a critical factor for foldable phones, as consumers are less willing to compromise on thickness for the larger screen. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said Apple plans to make a folding iPhone starting next year. Despite advances, the market for foldable devices remains small, accounting for just 2% of the overall smartphone market this year.</p>

Bengio, who helped lay the foundation for today‚Äôs advanced AI, is increasingly worried about the technology and its potential risks. He is now pivoting to a backup plan, developing "Scientist AI" to block harmful actions by other AIs. Scientist AI would calculate the probability that an AI's action would cause harm and block it if the risk is too high, acting as a guardrail for AI systems.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay a total of 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers, ruling that in some cases their repeated detentions by the country's immigration agency did not take account of their physical and mental conditions. The court said that on some occasions, they were detained despite deteriorating health conditions, such as a diagnosis of depression. The plaintiffs also questioned the immigration law itself, which allows detention without going through a review process such as trials, saying that it infringes the human rights covenants.</p>
