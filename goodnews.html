          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a massive $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to an unnamed major company, causing its shares to rise over 2%. The long-term deal is effective immediately and will run until the end of 2033. Citing the need to protect trade secrets at the request of its counterparty, Samsung will not disclose further details until the contract concludes. This significant agreement comes as the South Korean tech giant, the world's second-largest foundry service provider, aims to bolster its chip business amid struggles to capture demand in the competitive AI sector.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service took an individual into custody after they climbed a fence at the U.S. Treasury Building, which is adjacent to the White House. The incident occurred Sunday afternoon, prompting a security response that included the Metropolitan Police Department's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team to clear a bag the suspect had dropped. The individual was transported for a medical evaluation and will face charges for unlawful entry and a fugitive from justice warrant. The article notes this event occurs amid heightened security awareness following two past assassination attempts on President Trump.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material as part of an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull." The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led and used the network, which at its peak had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. One of the key figures, labeled a significant global purveyor of such material, was sentenced to life in prison. Officials called the operation one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy applies to universities, hospitals, and companies, stating that individuals should not be punished or have their performance evaluations affected if failures are due to technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct. The move is designed to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and take risks without fear of reprisal for unsuccessful outcomes, fostering a more robust environment for scientific and technological breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>Leaders across Europe have generally welcomed the new trade agreement with the United States, which sets a 15% tariff on most European goods. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the deal "positive" and said it ensures stability, a sentiment echoed by Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who noted it would protect jobs. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the agreement preserved Germany's fundamental interests by averting a more damaging trade war. While many leaders, like Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, conceded that a zero-tariff scenario would have been preferable, the consensus is that the deal provides crucial clarity and predictability for European businesses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a significant trade deal, ending months of tense negotiations. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods imported into the U.S., half the rate Trump had threatened, while a 50% tariff on steel remains. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. energy products and investing heavily in the U.S. economy. The agreement brings stability to the €1.4 trillion transatlantic trade relationship, though it marks a victory for Trump's tariff tactics, with EU exporters facing higher rates than before his presidency.</p>

Despite the company reporting a beat and raise, the stock fell sharply, which Cramer attributes to factors like the complexity of its upcoming three-way split, a lack of data center exposure, and general market impatience. He argues that the company is a strong participant in American reindustrialization and that the long-term value from the breakup is being overlooked.
