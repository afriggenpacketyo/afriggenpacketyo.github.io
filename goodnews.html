          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 19:17:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) is pushing for the County Championship season to be shortened from 14 to 12 games per team. The association argues this reduction is the "only reasonable option" to protect player welfare and enhance the quality of the competition. Citing research where 83% of players expressed concern for their physical wellbeing under the current schedule, the PCA supports a new conference-style model or a traditional divisional structure, as long as the number of matches is reduced. This proposal comes as a broader review of England's domestic cricket structure is nearing its conclusion.</p>

          <h2>National Park Service Debunks Viral Rumors of Mass Wildlife Migration from Yellowstone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 18:42:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Park Service (NPS) has refuted false rumors circulating on social media that claim wildlife is migrating out of Yellowstone National Park in large numbers. Viral videos, believed to be AI-generated or satirical, depicted herds of bison, bears, and other animals leaving the park, fueling speculation about a potential supervolcano eruption. Wildlife experts confirm that animal movements are normal, with some seasonal migration for food, but there is no mass exodus. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the volcano's alert level is normal, and officials are working to correct the misinformation.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding its future energy security and supply, making continued opposition counterproductive. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including measures to further restrict oil and gas revenue and disconnect more banks from the SWIFT payment system.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after noticing mild swelling in his legs. A letter from his physician described the condition as "benign" and common in adults over 70. Chronic venous insufficiency is a circulatory issue where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood return to the heart, causing blood to pool. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods like wearing compression stockings and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which help pump blood. The president is reported to be in otherwise "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The city of Long Beach is considering a proposal to bring a new independent minor league baseball team to play at the historic Blair Field. The city council is set to review a plan to work with an ownership group that includes a co-founder of the successful Oakland Ballers. If approved, the new team would join the Pioneer League as an expansion team for the next season. Proponents believe that despite past failures of independent league teams in the city, Long Beach's strong baseball tradition and current growth make it an ideal time to reintroduce professional baseball.</p>

          <p>Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China tripled in the first half of 2025, a significant increase that analysts believe reflects shifting global supply chains due to U.S.-China trade tensions. While the absolute value is still small, the growth is seen as part of China's strategy to diversify its access to strategic minerals. A report from the China-Brazil Business Council noted that as trade barriers between Washington and Beijing harden, emerging economies like Brazil are absorbing some of the impact. Overall, Brazil's trade surplus with China has narrowed significantly compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $11.08 billion. The company's net income rose to $3.1 billion, and it increased its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy member growth and a weaker U.S. dollar. This is the second quarter Netflix has not released specific subscriber data, instead focusing on metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the strong results, the company warned that margins in the second half of the year would be lower due to higher costs associated with its upcoming content slate. (not investment advice)</p>
