          <p>San Francisco's Tommy's Mexican Restaurant, celebrating its 60th anniversary, is recognized as a global epicenter for tequila, significantly contributing to the spirit's surging popularity. Owner Julio Bermejo, a global ambassador for the tequila industry, pioneered the use of 100% agave tequila and created the widely adopted Tommy's margarita recipe. Tequila sales in the U.S. rose by nearly 8% last year, surpassing American whiskey and bourbon to become the second-highest-selling spirit after vodka. Bermejo's dedication has fostered a loyal community, including a club with over 10,000 members and educational excursions to Mexico.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating flooding that closed Tennessee's Nolichucky River to whitewater rafting, a group of former raft guides has launched a significant clean-up mission. Funded by state relief grants, these guides, including Amelia Taylor now a "professional trash lady," are diligently removing extensive debris, such as car parts and household items, from the riverbanks. While the river is anticipated to reopen for the 2026 season, guides will require retraining due to the "New-lichucky's" altered rapids. This community-led effort symbolizes a powerful rebirth and reconnection with the vital waterway.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, this article details the potential earnings for a $20,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account, highlighting that while rates have seen a decline, savers can still accumulate hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest. For instance, a one-year CD at 4.20% could yield $840 upon maturity, and a five-year CD at 3.85% could earn over $4,000. The article advises potential investors to act promptly to secure current rates, as further Fed cuts are anticipated, potentially leading to lower offers from banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article calculates the monthly costs of a $60,000 home equity loan after a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, noting that fixed-rate loans are becoming more affordable for homeowners. For example, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% would cost approximately $739 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be around $581 monthly. The article also compares these options to Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer lower variable rates but carry the inherent risk of future increases. It emphasizes the critical importance of borrowing only what can be comfortably repaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stress physiologist Dr. Rebecca Heiss challenges conventional stress management advice, asserting that focusing inward through self-care is often ineffective, with her research showing 58% of people stress more when trying to control it. Instead, she advocates for "stress springboarding," channeling stress energy outward by helping others, as studies on workplace wellness programs confirm its efficacy. Heiss explains that stress is inherently a social experience, triggering oxytocin to foster connection, and that actively contributing to others' well-being literally rewires the brain, activating reward centers and reducing stress-related activity.</p>
