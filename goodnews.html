          <h2>Experts Analyze Demographics of 'No Kings' Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 16:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to experts, the "No Kings" protests in Washington, D.C., were primarily attended by educated White women in their 40s, who organized via social media. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert suggests these protests serve as a form of group therapy, providing a sense of community and validation for shared grievances. However, Alpert cautions that this catharsis can mask personal unhappiness and project anger onto others, and he added that some participants inaccurately equate the movement with the Civil Rights movement, distorting their perspective. The rallies also featured individuals in inflatable costumes, a tactic intended to draw attention without inciting violence, which began in Portland during protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. The article highlights the blurring lines between emotional expression and civic engagement in contemporary activism. Optimism score is not directly related to the article's content.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland, securing a landslide victory and becoming the first president to secure over 900,000 votes. Connolly, an independent backed by left-wing parties, pledged to be an inclusive president who listens and reflects, advocating for peace, neutrality, and action on climate change. The election saw an unprecedented number of spoiled votes and a turnout of 46%, as Humphreys conceded defeat. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Simon Harris congratulated Connolly, while Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald hailed it as a victory for the combined opposition, as Connolly will be inaugurated on November 11, succeeding Michael D. Higgins. The article details the political landscape of Ireland during the election.</p>

          <p>June Lockhart, known for her iconic roles as a mother on television shows such as “Lassie” and “Lost in Space,” passed away at the age of 100. Lockhart's career spanned decades, during which she happily played supportive roles to children, animals, and robots. She also worked as an unofficial member of the White House press corps, attending briefings and traveling with presidents. The article highlights her ability to adapt to different roles, and her lasting impact on television, as Lockhart's career included roles on “Full House,” “Las Vegas,” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” and is survived by her daughters and grandchildren, and the family requests donations to the Actors Fund, ProPublica, and International Hearing Dog Inc.</p>

          <p>Negotiators from China and the U.S. have initiated a new round of trade discussions in Malaysia, preceding a highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea. Trump expressed his hope for a productive meeting with Xi and expects China to negotiate a deal to avoid additional tariffs, while Beijing recently implemented tighter export controls on rare earths and other critical minerals. Trump also stated his openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, potentially their first meeting since 2019, though Kim has stated that he would only be open to meeting with Trump if Washington recognizes the country as a nuclear state. Seoul's reunification minister believes there is a considerable chance that Trump and Kim will meet.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Misleading Statistics on Sexual Assault in Europe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 14:58:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An X post is circulating with a bar graph purporting to show the UK as having the highest rate of sexual assault in Europe, but this claim is misleading due to differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. The UK's high rate is more reflective of its reporting practices and legal definitions than actual prevalence, and some countries have very narrow legal definitions requiring proof of physical attack, threat, or coercion. Criminologists recommend victim surveys, which ask representative samples of people about their experiences, as a better way to measure sexual assault rates. The claim that uncontrolled mass immigration is driving the higher rates of sexual assault is false, and there is no evidence to suggest that that's the case at all.</p>

          <p>Germany plans to bolster its ability to detect Russian submarines by acquiring eight Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, designed for reconnaissance and surveillance. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius observed the aircraft's capabilities during a flight with the Royal British Air Force, noting the effectiveness of sonar buoys in detecting ships. The German Navy will collaborate with NATO allies to monitor the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea from air bases in Scotland, Iceland, and Germany. This move is part of a broader effort to enhance European security and address the increasing presence of Russian submarines in the region.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has indicated the possibility of another presidential run, stating, "I am not done," in an interview with the BBC, where she promoted her new book about her 2024 campaign. Harris criticized President Trump, calling him a "tyrant," and expressed her belief that her warnings about his authoritarian tendencies had been validated. The White House responded to Harris' assertions, dismissing her claims, and CBS News polling indicates limited support for a Harris presidential run in 2028, even among California Democrats. Harris emphasized her commitment to a life of service and suggested that a woman would eventually hold the presidency.</p>

          <p>The "VOO and chill" investment strategy, which involves passively investing in ETFs tied to market indexes, may be losing its appeal as investors seek greater diversification. Tidal Financial Group's Gavin Filmore notes that many clients are no longer satisfied with simply buying the index in an ETF, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, and Strategas Securities' Todd Sohn contends that the S&P 500 is becoming increasingly imbalanced, with technology stocks dominating the index. Investors are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, and the Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past six months. Major tech companies are due to report earnings next week.</p>

          <p>The European Union is actively working to reduce its reliance on rare earth elements from China, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China is the top producer and exporter of rare earths, vital for various technologies, and has recently imposed new license requirements and curbs on exports. The EU says the curbs are forcing some of the bloc's companies to suspend production and are inflicting significant economic damage, and von der Leyen said the EU was still trying to find solutions with China in the "short term," but she warned that the bloc was "ready to use all the instruments in our toolbox to respond if needed." The EU plans to secure alternative sources, promote recycling, and establish partnerships with countries that produce critical raw materials.</p>

Cuban argues that saving 40% on household items like toothpaste and toilet paper can result in significant savings over a year, he suggests people use credit cards for purchases they can't pay off immediately. He emphasizes the importance of practical money management over flashy investments, as the article highlights Cuban's logic rooted in what actually works, not what sounds good, and he has been open in the past about how getting his own card cut up was one of the toughest lessons he ever learned.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which proposes redrawing congressional district lines, may prevail due to strong anti-Trump sentiment among California voters. The measure aims to counterbalance Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states, and Democrats are framing it as an opportunity to "screw Trump". Polls suggest rising support for the measure, with many voters motivated by their opposition to Trump, as the "yes" side has significantly outraised the "no" side, and even Arnold Schwarzenegger's opposition has proven ineffective.
