          <h2>Greenlandic Bricklayer Gains Unlikely Political Influence Through Trump Support</h2>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become a political influencer due to his fervent support for President Trump, even facing hostility at home. His championing of Trump, who has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, has made him unpopular among many Greenlanders, but has also opened doors to investors and media attention. Boassen now works for a nonprofit promoting closer ties between the U.S. and Greenland, advocating for a security alliance between an independent Greenland and Washington, viewing Denmark as inadequate for defending the island. Despite some criticism, Boassen believes he is part of something bigger and wants Greenland to seize the opportunity while Trump's attention is focused on the region.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in flight missions. This breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, allows drones to execute high-risk maneuvers previously considered unstable, drawing inspiration from the aerial acrobatics of birds and bats. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasizes that transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards' redefines traditional drone flight paradigms. Aerobatic flight, as the name suggests, involves high-risk manoeuvres that require unstable postures ‚Äì movements rarely executed in conventional flight operations for most aircraft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing potential strain on state finances. Senior officials within his administration have also been dismissive of such a cut, as the government seeks to formulate an economic package before the House of Councillors election. While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative ways to support those in need, also noting that Japan will continue to seek a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by ICE in March. A federal judge ordered her release, citing concerns that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated. Ozturk was detained after co-authoring an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper regarding Israel's war with Hamas, which the Trump administration cited as the main reason for revoking her student visa. Supporters, including Sen. Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, welcomed Ozturk home and vowed to continue fighting for her exoneration and visa restoration.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial, led by Chinese and US scientists, indicates that a new medication shows promise for treating a difficult type of lung cancer. The oral medication zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking tyrosine kinase activity. Unlike existing intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, zongertinib carries fewer risks of adverse effects. The study, conducted across 82 sites globally, suggests zongertinib could establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC, according to Professor Wang Xin.</p>

          <p>China's car sales increased for the third consecutive month in April, rising 14.8% year-on-year, driven by government-subsidized auto trade-ins that offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on consumer sentiment. Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids grew significantly, comprising over half of total car sales. While exports declined, domestic buyers are showing less interest in automated-driving systems following a government crackdown on misleading marketing terms and a fatal crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 sedan. The government scheme that hands out larger subsides to trade-ins of old cars for NEVs than for gasoline vehicles had covered 2.71 million cars as of April 24.</p>

Gallego, who represents a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need for alliances with those who may not agree 100% of the time.
