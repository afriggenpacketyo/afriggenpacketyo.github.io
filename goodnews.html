          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have established a framework agreement aimed at implementing the Geneva consensus, a trade truce established last month, following high-level talks in London. The agreement awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping before implementation can proceed. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and China's international trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement to reporters. Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noted that unresolved details require internal discussion, making the agreement's potential for concrete breakthroughs uncertain. The framework signals a commitment to de-escalate and continue dialogue. (not investment advice)</p>

Abrego Garcia faces human smuggling charges, and the Trump administration has accused him of MS-13 membership, which his family denies.
