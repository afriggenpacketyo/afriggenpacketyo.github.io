        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. payroll growth totaled 177,000 in April, surpassing expectations despite worries about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%, while the labor force participation rate increased to 62.6%. Job gains were primarily driven by the health care, transportation, and financial sectors. The report led traders to delay expectations for an interest rate cut, with the strong numbers suggesting resilience in the economy before the tariff shock. However, experts caution that the economy may weaken in the coming months if tariff tensions escalate.</p>

Robust corporate results and a resilient UK economy also contribute to the FTSE 100's upward momentum.
