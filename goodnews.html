          <p>The United Kingdom's government has officially announced its support for London's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships. This backing, which includes significant funding, provides a major boost for the proposal to bring the event back to London Stadium for the first time since 2017. The decision follows an open letter from over 100 British athletes urging support and addresses previous concerns about the necessary government investment. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that hosting the championships would be a moment of national pride and would inspire the next generation of athletes.</p>

          <p>In a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stressed the urgent need to end the conflict in Syria. Fidan expressed Turkey's readiness to collaborate with the United States to achieve a lasting peace and voiced support for the constructive role Washington is playing. He also warned that Israeli interventions in Syrian territory and any attacks on Syria's sovereignty are exacerbating the situation and undermining regional peace efforts. This diplomatic exchange comes as a U.S. envoy announced an agreement for a ceasefire between Israel and Syria following recent deadly clashes.</p>

          <h2>LAFC Faces Rival LA Galaxy in High-Stakes Derby Following Club World Cup Disappointment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles FC is set to face its rival, the LA Galaxy, in a crucial derby match, seeking to regain favor with its fans after a disappointing performance in the Club World Cup. LAFC, currently fourth in the Western Conference, has recovered some momentum with three consecutive MLS wins, but a victory against the last-place Galaxy would be particularly meaningful. Despite their differing standings, LAFC's coach Steve Cherundolo emphasizes that form is irrelevant in such a heated rivalry. The match is also marked by injuries for LAFC and a protest from Galaxy supporter groups over the club's silence on ICE raids.</p>

          <p>In an effort to demonstrate its safety and allay public fears, the Japanese government has delivered decontaminated soil from the Fukushima region to be used at the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo. The slightly radioactive soil, collected after the 2011 nuclear disaster, will be used as foundation material in a garden, following safety guidelines endorsed by the IAEA. This is part of a larger government initiative to recycle the 14 million cubic meters of soil stored near the Fukushima plant. However, the plan faces significant public skepticism, with a previous proposal to use the soil in public parks being scrapped due to protests.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, Deborah Mason, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating an £80 million drug empire that involved her four children and other relatives. Known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' she directed a sophisticated operation supplying cocaine across the UK, using the profits to fund a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. The Metropolitan Police tracked the family-run gang for seven months, observing numerous drug and cash handovers. The judge described Mason as having a 'leading role' and corrupting her children, who also received lengthy prison sentences for their involvement in the conspiracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The new technique allows for the production of the necessary anticancer cells directly within the patient's body using gene therapy tools. This in-vivo approach is significantly simpler and cheaper than the conventional method, which can cost over $139,000 per treatment. The team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology has already used this innovative method to successfully treat four patients with multiple myeloma, offering hope for wider access to this promising therapy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated 2-0 by the Milwaukee Brewers, but the game featured an encouraging performance from pitcher Tyler Glasnow. In his second start since returning from injury, Glasnow pitched six strong innings, allowing only one run and showing increased fastball velocity and better command. This outing is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on Glasnow to bolster their starting rotation for the second half of the season and a potential World Series run. Despite the loss, his return to form after struggling with injuries represents a significant step forward for the pitcher and the team.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has signed into law the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, aiming to legitimize the use of stablecoins for payments and potentially boosting their adoption by banks and consumers. The law requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets, a move proponents say will buttress the dollar's global status. However, critics argue the bill lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to illicit use. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central disciplinary authorities are publicly shaming a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prominent example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The 'Yaohan Longevity City' project, which was intended to be a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after poor decisions and a broken capital chain. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) condemned the local officials for making 'blind decisions' that led to a severe waste of resources. This public censure serves as a stern warning to other local-level governments across China to avoid similar ill-conceived vanity projects.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans support the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Approximately two-thirds of the public favor these space exploration goals, with younger Americans showing particularly strong enthusiasm. The poll also found that a large majority still believe the original 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile endeavor. These findings suggest broad public backing for the nation's space program, which many feel contributes to national pride and produces beneficial technological advancements for society.</p>
