        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the recent U.S. strikes targeted Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself, emphasizing the administration's goal to dismantle the program rather than engage in a broader conflict. Vance claimed the strikes had substantially set back Iran's nuclear capabilities, though he couldn't definitively confirm complete destruction of facilities. He mentioned the administration's intention to address the remaining enriched uranium and warned Iran against retaliation, promising a forceful response. The administration, according to Vance, seeks to eliminate Iran's nuclear program without pursuing regime change or a protracted Middle East conflict. Optimism surrounding the containment of nuclear proliferation is tempered by the risk of escalation. </p>

Schwarzenegger also addressed the topic of nepotism and his relationship with his famous father, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He recounted his early experiences in business, managing his father's memorabilia and learning about sales.

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski discusses her experiences as a moderate in a polarized Washington, D.C., and her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C." She emphasizes her allegiance to the people of Alaska, rather than to the Republican Party, and reflects on her write-in victory in 2010, which she says gave her a new freedom. Murkowski, who never voted for Donald Trump, expresses concern about Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch. She acknowledges the challenges of working with an administration she did not support, highlighting the importance of relationships in being effective for Alaska. The senator's perspective offers insights into the challenges of bipartisanship in modern American politics.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East showed mixed reactions after the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high, fueled by the hope that Washington's intervention might hasten the conflict's end. Gulf markets displayed resilience, with Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experiencing a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw modest gains. Egypt's EGX30 emerged as a significant gainer, closing 2.7% higher. Analysts suggest the Gulf's emphasis on peaceful resolution has shielded it from major market turmoil. The removal of the Iranian threat could positively influence international investors. (not investment advice)</p>
