          <p>China's instant commerce market is rapidly evolving, driven by intense competition between giants like Alibaba and Meituan, offering consumers unprecedented promotional subsidies and swift deliveries. These platforms have expanded beyond food delivery to include a wide range of products, such as Apple's new iPhone 17 models, now available for delivery in as little as 30 minutes. This "instant commerce war" is transforming China's retail landscape, pushing both online platforms and traditional brick-and-mortar stores to enhance efficiency and customer service. The fierce competition has resulted in incredibly low prices for consumers, exemplified by a cup of coffee costing just 0.01 yuan on Taobao Shangou, marking a significant shift in retail dynamics.</p>

          <p>Three octogenarian Austrian nuns, Sisters Bernadette (88), Regina (86), and Rita (82), defiantly fled the care home where they were placed and returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen. The nuns, who had spent decades at the convent and school, stated they were moved against their will in December 2023, despite having lifelong residency rights granted when the community was dissolved. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their old home, which initially lacked electricity and water, but now has partial services restored. Church authorities have called their return "completely incomprehensible," citing health concerns, but the nuns express profound joy at being back in their cherished home.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel, in his first official capacity as music and artistic director designate, opened the New York Philharmonic's fall season with a program featuring Bartók's Piano Concerto No. 3 and Charles Ives' Symphony No. 2. The concert began with a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, "of light and stone," evoking Hawaii's pre-statehood era. Dudamel's debut performance, following his two weeks conducting the Simon Bolivar Orchestra for Coldplay, marks a new chapter for the orchestra, aiming to recapture the public attention it held during the Leonard Bernstein era. Young Korean pianist Yunchan Lim, a Van Cliburn competition winner, performed as a soloist, though the article suggests his Bartók interpretation was not imaginative enough.</p>

          <h2>"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" Review Finds Sequel Lacks Original's Satire</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review for "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel, despite the return of its original cast and director Rob Reiner, fails to recapture the sharp satire of the 1984 mockumentary classic. While agreeable silliness emerges from seeing the trio, Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls, in their solo lives, the article argues that the reverence shown by real-life music legends, who appear in cameos, saps the comedy of its outsider tension. The film is criticized for relying on gag encores, such as the recurring drummer mortality problem, and for missing opportunities for comedic friction. Ultimately, the review concludes the sequel feels more like a nostalgia lap than a fresh take, leaving the original's legacy unharmed but the new film a low-wattage experience.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook explained the company's $2.5 billion investment in Corning's Kentucky glass factory, praising Corning's "ceramic shield" technology for its strength, thinness, and durability. This significant investment ensures all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches will be manufactured domestically, expanding a partnership that began with the first iPhone in 2007. Corning CEO Wendell Weeks noted the investment will boost the factory's workforce by 50% and triple production, transforming it into a world-leading site for specialized glass, building on its history since 1952. Cook highlighted the broader benefit of domestic manufacturing in creating "a hub of economic activity" and jobs, seeing it as a "social contract" with the community.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Landmark Bill to Boost Dense Housing Near Transit</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill that overrides local zoning laws to significantly expand high-density housing near transit hubs. Introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill allows for buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, seven stories within a quarter-mile, and six stories within a half-mile, aiming to address the state's severe housing shortage. Single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit would be subject to these new rules. While proponents argue drastic measures are necessary, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, claim it's an overreach that strips local authority and disproportionately affects lower-priced neighborhoods. The bill gained crucial support after amendments added union hiring requirements to certain projects.</p>
