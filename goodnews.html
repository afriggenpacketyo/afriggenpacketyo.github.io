          <p>U.S. and Chinese trade officials convened in London to continue discussions aimed at resolving trade differences following a call between the two countries' leaders. President Trump's team, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese counterparts led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. The U.S. is seeking confirmation that China will restore flows of critical minerals, while Trump has reportedly authorized his team to consider easing restrictions on sales of certain U.S. technologies. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism for a quick resolution with a "big, strong handshake."</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hails the decision as a boost for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasizes its importance for clean energy. However, critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue the true costs are not transparent and the project could increase consumer bills. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review, with the project expected to take at least a decade to complete.</p>

The media giant will separate its studio and streaming business, which includes HBO Max, from its traditional cable television networks like CNN and Discovery. This strategic move comes as streaming services gain popularity while cable TV audiences decline. The Streaming & Studios business will be led by Mr. Zaslav, while Global Networks will be headed by Gunnar Wiedenfels, aiming to provide each division with sharper focus and strategic flexibility in the evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, highlighting its "fundamental flaws" and outdated gender stereotypes. The report by the Women and Equalities Committee recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. The report highlights that the current system is completely out of sync with the cost of living, especially considering that new fathers are ineligible for statutory paternity leave if they are self-employed or earn less than ¬£123 a week. The government is currently conducting a review to assess how best to support working families.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite marking and administrative tasks, such as writing letters to parents. The Department for Education (DfE) advises teachers to be transparent about their use of AI and to always verify its results, using the technology for low-stakes marking and routine communications. While the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges AI's potential to free up time for face-to-face teaching, concerns remain about data breaches and marking errors. The DfE emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking such as quizzes or homework, and teachers must check its results.</p>
