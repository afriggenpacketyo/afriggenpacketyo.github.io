          <p>President Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, describing their discussion as constructive just days after publicly demanding Tan's resignation over alleged ties to China. The meeting, which included the Secretaries of Commerce and the Treasury, suggests a significant reversal in the administration's stance. This development occurred shortly after Senator Tom Cotton raised concerns about Tan's past business dealings. The shift highlights the administration's active and often unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry as it navigates technological competition with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is currently moving westward, with models projecting it could become a major hurricane by the end of the week as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its formation marks an increase in activity during the Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters have predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix for their Archewell Productions, extending their relationship with the streaming giant. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their previous overall deal from 2020, giving them more flexibility. The couple has produced several projects for Netflix, including the popular documentary series "Harry & Meghan" and the cooking show "With Love, Meghan." Their upcoming slate includes a second season of the cooking show and a film adaptation of a romance novel.</p>

The project, proposed by a New York-based developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for when construction might begin. Experts note that despite high housing demand, challenges such as high interest rates, tariffs on materials, and rising labor costs are making it difficult for new large-scale housing projects to move forward in the current financial climate.</p>

          <p>Young fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance to help the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory over the London Spirit at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old was praised by his captain, Phil Salt, after a spell where he conceded only 22 runs and took a key wicket, troubling international veterans David Warner and Kane Williamson with his pace and swing. Baker's bowling was instrumental in restricting the Spirit's chase. Earlier in the match, 20-year-old Ben McKinney also impressed with a quick 29 runs on his debut.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, reversing a recent ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

This decision would have applied to any country exporting these types of gold bars, which are crucial for backing contracts on the COMEX futures market.

The piece lampoons Trump's aesthetic preferences, envisioning an Oval Office redesign inspired by King Midas and Versailles, complete with a leopard on a gold leash. It also pokes fun at his political agenda, with jokes about ghost-hunting teams being put in charge of national healthcare and tearing up the Rose Garden to install an Au Bon Pain patio. The overarching theme is Trump's desire to transform the people's house into his own "forever home."</p>

This mine is responsible for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. The suspension has tightened an already constrained market, leading investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to the reduced supply. (not investment advice)</p>
