          <p>A paraglider in China, Peng Yujiang, miraculously survived being pulled to an altitude of 28,208 feet without oxygen after being caught in a powerful updraft. Peng, an experienced paraglider, was conducting a routine equipment test when he became trapped inside a cumulonimbus cloud system, a phenomenon known as "cloud suck." Despite the extreme conditions, including flying through thick clouds and ice forming on his face and equipment, Peng managed to survive the ordeal. Peng has been handed a six-month flight suspension, as the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance.</p>

          <p>British universities are preparing to attract international Chinese students following the Trump administration's crackdown on visas for Chinese students studying in the U.S. The U.S. plans to "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party. This policy shift is expected to disrupt the flow of Chinese students to the U.S., prompting them to consider alternative study destinations such as the U.K. The U.K.'s appeal lies in shorter degree durations, affordable living costs, and global recognition.</p>

          <h2>Key Money Moves to Consider While Fed Keeps Interest Rates High</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 11:01:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that an interest rate cut is unlikely in the near future, experts recommend several money moves for consumers. These include paying down credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. Given that credit card interest rates are hovering around 20%, borrowers should consider balance transfers or personal loans to lower their rates. Locking in high-yield savings rates can help consumers earn better returns before the Fed eventually lowers rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Highlights Potential Rise in Children's Cavities if Fluoride Removed from Water</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 11:00:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Jama Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from public drinking water supplies in the U.S. could result in an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years. This would represent a 7.5% increase in cavities, costing $9.8 billion and resulting in the loss of 2.9 million quality-adjusted life years. The study emphasizes that fluoride is highly effective in preventing tooth decay and that the additional cases would disproportionately affect children most at-risk for tooth decay. The findings counter arguments made by some officials who advocate for ending water fluoridation.</p>
