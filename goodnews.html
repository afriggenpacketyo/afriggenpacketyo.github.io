          <p>China has announced that it will accelerate work on the Mohmand Hydropower Project in Pakistan following India's recent threats to cut off water supplies. The China Energy Engineering Corporation has been working on the project since 2019, and it is now scheduled to be completed next year. This action follows India's announcement that it would suspend the Indus Waters Treaty with its neighbor. The suspension of the treaty has left Pakistan facing water security risks, as the country reportedly relies on the Indus river system for about 80 per cent of its agriculture.</p>

Thousands of people may have been exposed to the hepatitis C virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Patients signing up to a GP practice who received a blood transfusion before 1996 will be offered a test for hepatitis C.

          <p>With the world having changed significantly since the original Brexit deal, both the UK and EU are looking to make changes to the current trade deal. While the government has promised not to take the UK back into the EU's customs union, single market, or freedom of movement, there is still much to be discussed. The EU is keen on a youth mobility scheme, allowing young people from the UK and EU to travel more easily. The government acknowledges the plan is being discussed and has started to sell what they see as its merits.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan has the potential to compete with the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. While the yuan already functions well in cross-border settlements, China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. The economist suggests China should model its existing 'connect' schemes with Hong Kong, which allows foreign investors to buy mainland Chinese bonds and stocks without special licenses.

          <p>Anduril Industries CEO Brian Schrimpf unveiled the Fury, an unmanned fighter jet designed to use artificial intelligence and fly without a pilot. Fury is a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) that's designed to work in coordination with a manned aircraft. Schrimpf told 60 Minutes that Fury would work in conjunction with a manned aircraft flying behind it, spotting enemies and protecting the manned aircraft. Components, like the landing gear, use common parts that are more readily available in the United States when compared to a typical fighter jet, which could make it easier and cheaper to mass produce.</p>
