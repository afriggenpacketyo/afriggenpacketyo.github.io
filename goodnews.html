          <p>Nvidia has launched its new Jetson AGX Thor chip module, priced at $3,499 for a developer kit, aiming to capitalize on the rapidly expanding robotics market. This 'robot brain' is 7.5 times faster than its predecessor, enabling advanced generative AI models crucial for humanoid robots and self-driving cars. Despite robotics currently representing only 1% of Nvidia's revenue, the company sees it as its largest growth opportunity outside of core artificial intelligence. Major tech firms and robotics companies are already utilizing Nvidia's Jetson chips, signaling significant industry adoption.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, with plans to later split KDP into two separate U.S.-listed entities. One company will focus on coffee brands, while the other will manage soft drinks like Dr Pepper and Snapple, effectively unwinding their 2018 merger. This strategic move aims to create a "global coffee champion" and generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Despite a subsequent 8% dip in KDP stock, the deal reflects a broader industry trend of companies seeking to optimize their portfolios amidst competitive pressures and volatile commodity prices.

This collectible, featuring both NBA legends' uniform logos and signatures, surpassed the previous record for the most expensive trading card sold. O'Leary, along with partners Matt Allen and Paul Warshaw, formed a syndicate to purchase the card, viewing it as a long-term investment asset comparable to bitcoin or gold holdings. He believes the sports collectibles market is gaining institutional recognition and defying recessions due to the rarity of such items. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wolves have rejected a substantial £50 million bid from Newcastle United for their Norway international striker, Jorgen Strand Larsen. Newcastle, seeking a center-forward after Callum Wilson's departure, may return with an improved offer, but Wolves are determined to retain the key player. Strand Larsen, who joined Wolves permanently for £23 million last month after scoring 14 goals on loan, is considered a vital part of their squad. This rejection highlights the challenge Newcastle faces in securing top talent before the transfer window closes, as they also had bids for Yoane Wissa turned down.</p>

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro credited the deployment of federal agencies and a unified law enforcement force for reshaping public safety in the capital. The operation, which began quietly in August, escalated with the temporary federalization of the Metropolitan Police Department under emergency powers. This initiative, including an executive order targeting cashless bail, is presented as a model for other cities like Chicago, despite criticism from local leaders.</p>

          <h2>Edinburgh Fringe Festival Grapples with Rising Costs, Threatening Its Inclusive Spirit</h2>

          <p>The Edinburgh Fringe Festival, one of the world's largest arts festivals, is facing challenges from rising costs that threaten its traditional open-to-all, experimental ethos. While historically a platform for emerging talent like Robin Williams and Lin-Manuel Miranda, performers and attendees alike are finding the festival increasingly expensive. Artists bear the full cost of participation, often leaving thousands of pounds poorer, making it less accessible for those without financial backing. Despite its continued popularity and significant cultural impact, concerns are growing that the Fringe is becoming too commercialized, prompting discussions about preserving its alternative roots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Premier League weekend revealed significant tactical trends, particularly in Manchester United's loss to Fulham and Manchester City's defeat to Spurs. Fulham exploited United's defensive shape by creating midfield superiority and forcing center-backs out of position. Meanwhile, Spurs countered City's high press by attacking down the flanks, notably City's vulnerable left side, leading to their first goal. The article also highlighted Jack Grealish's impactful performance for Everton and a broader shift in how teams are pressing high, with wingers targeting central defenders, opening up space out wide. These observations suggest evolving strategies and potential weaknesses for top teams.</p>

He anticipates Nvidia's upcoming earnings report to be strong, reaffirming demand for its AI offerings from major tech companies. Cramer specifically recommended buying Palo Alto Networks, stating its post-earnings dip presents an opportunity given its strong performance and planned acquisition of CyberArk. He believes the market's reaction to Palo Alto is unwarranted and expects long-term growth for the cybersecurity firm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eric Thompson, a network engineering leader, is spearheading efforts to pass federal legislation, the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA), to ban "ghost jobs." These are job postings without a genuine intent to hire, used by companies for various reasons like collecting resumes or signaling growth. Thompson, who lost his job in 2024, found the practice a significant headache for job seekers. The proposed act would require transparency in listings, including hire dates and whether a role is new or a backfill, with fines for violators. His advocacy highlights a growing movement for job market transparency, mirroring efforts in Canada and several U.S. states.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid uncertain economic conditions, experts advise consumers on whether to prioritize high-yield savings accounts or stocks. High-yield savings are recommended for emergency funds, short-term goals, or minimizing risk due to principal protection and predictable returns, especially with current interest rates. However, rates may decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts them as expected. Stocks are favored for long-term goals and potential for higher returns, despite inherent market volatility and risk of loss. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are also presented as a viable alternative for locking in guaranteed returns without stock market risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola's rebuild of Manchester City is exhibiting early missteps, as evidenced by their recent 4-3 Club World Cup defeat to Al-Hilal and a 2-1 loss to Spurs in the Premier League. Despite a strong opening win against Wolves, tactical vulnerabilities, particularly an openness at the back and goalkeeping errors, have become apparent. The departure of Ederson and the potential signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma, whose passing style differs significantly, suggest a possible shift in City's possession-based approach. These early results indicate that the team's evolution remains a work in progress, challenging their aura of invincibility.</p>
