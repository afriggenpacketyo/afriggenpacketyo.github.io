          <p>This article discusses the current landscape of CD interest rates and strategies for maximizing savings in an economy with persistent inflation. It highlights that leading CD accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate and allow investors to lock in high rates for the term of the CD. The article advises comparing rates from online banks, which often have fewer overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve. Ultimately, it encourages individuals to explore various banking options and term lengths to achieve their savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>
