          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to headline a fundraiser for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where the top sponsorship costs $2 million and includes a photo opportunity with the former president. Trump, who chairs the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, has recently overhauled the center's leadership, appointing allies to key positions. This management shift has sparked controversy, with some performances being canceled in protest. Trump has stated that the Kennedy Center was in disrepair due to poor management and that he intends to restore it to its former glory.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly told Donald Trump that Canada is "not for sale" and has no intention of becoming the 51st U.S. state. Despite Trump's insistence that such a merger would be a "wonderful marriage," Carney emphasized the importance of the existing partnership between the two countries. The leaders also discussed trade, with Trump suggesting a possible renegotiation of the USMCA agreement and expressing concerns about Canadian economic self-sufficiency. Carney's Liberal Party recently won the Canadian election on a platform of resisting Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Utah has become the first state in the U.S. to ban fluoride in public drinking water, a decision opposed by many dentists and health experts. Governor Spencer Cox signed the law, arguing that individuals should have the choice to consume fluoride. Critics worry that the ban will increase tooth decay, especially among low-income residents. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When dealing with delinquent debt sold to a collection agency, offering a lump-sum settlement can be a viable strategy. Debt collectors may reject offers if they are too low, the debt is fresh, or they believe you can pay more. Improving chances of settlement involves doing research, offering proof of hardship, working with a debt relief expert, and remaining patient and persistent. A debt relief expert could help you settle your debt today. (not investment advice)</p>

The Druze hold that members of their faith who die suddenly are immediately reincarnated as newborn babies. In the Druze religion, reincarnation is seen as a path to spiritual purification, an opportunity for souls whose lives have been cut short to achieve enlightenment.</p>
