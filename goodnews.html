        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, falling slightly below economists' expectations. This sustained low inflation, along with unchanged core inflation, gives the Monetary Authority of Singapore flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy. The central bank aims to support economic growth in the face of an uncertain global trade environment and subdued domestic growth forecasts. Analysts note the monetary authority appears concerned about the future impact of global economic softening and trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laurent Mekies is set to begin his tenure as the new team principal of Red Bull's Formula 1 team, replacing the dismissed Christian Horner. Mekies, an experienced engineer, plans to start by listening and understanding the "magic" of the team that has seen immense success but has recently faced a competitive decline. His arrival signals a potential cultural shift, moving away from Horner's more confrontational style toward a softer, more collaborative approach. The change in leadership aims to stabilize the team and forge a new path forward without key figures like Horner and design chief Adrian Newey.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing "reciprocal" tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports to the U.S., which includes a reduction in duties on automobiles. President Trump described it as a massive deal that would open Japan's market to more American goods, including cars, trucks, and agricultural products. For Japan, the lowering of auto tariffs from 25% to 15% is a major development, as auto exports are a cornerstone of its economy. The agreement could also provide a political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A chain of stores called Duck World, which exclusively sells themed rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat in London's difficult retail landscape. Despite challenges like inflation and rising business costs, the co-founders have found success by appealing to tourists, collectors, and millennials with their 700 varieties of ducks. Retail analysts suggest the business benefits from the "treatonomics" trend, where consumers make small, mood-boosting purchases. The company's unique and quirky business model demonstrates how niche collectibles can carve out a space even when traditional retail is struggling.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossil have concluded that a formidable "terror bird" was likely killed or scavenged by an even larger predator. Bite marks on the fossilized leg bone, discovered in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, were matched to an extinct 5-meter-long caiman species. Terror birds were apex predators themselves, standing taller than humans with powerful beaks. This rare evidence of an interaction between two top predators provides new insight into the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even these fearsome birds were vulnerable in their swampy habitat.</p>

With the US imposing steep levies on such diverted imports, simply using Asean nations as assembly points is becoming riskier. Deeper integration and establishing genuine local operations would offer Chinese businesses more stability and protection from unpredictable US trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
