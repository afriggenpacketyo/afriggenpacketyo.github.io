These elements are often described as the 'vitamins' of industry, enabling technologies to become smaller, faster, and stronger. While not actually rare in terms of global deposits, their extraction and refining pose environmental challenges due to the use of solvents and potential radioactivity. </p>

          <p>While Americans pay trillions in rent annually, few receive a credit score boost because rent payments are not commonly reported to credit bureaus. This lack of reporting disproportionately affects minorities and immigrants, who are more likely to be 'credit invisible.' Services like Esusu are working to change this by partnering with landlords and offering direct reporting options for renters. By reporting rent payments, individuals can build credit history and improve their access to loans and other financial services. </p>
