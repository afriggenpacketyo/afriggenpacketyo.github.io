          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged that U.S. tariffs are significantly affecting Japanese companies, including automakers. Speaking after the G7 summit in Canada, Ishiba reiterated his commitment to safeguarding Japan's national interests during trade negotiations with Washington, and he emphasized that Japan will not rush into a deal that undermines these interests. Ishiba also mentioned the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, stating that Japan is closely monitoring crude oil and gasoline prices and preparing measures to mitigate any potential impact on daily life. The Prime Minister plans to visit the Netherlands for a NATO summit later in June, further solidifying Japan's ties with the military alliance, but his immediate focus remains on navigating the complex trade landscape amid global economic uncertainties. Optimism around Japan's ability to navigate these challenges is relatively stable. </p>

          <p>Endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could see a resurgence in UK waters as rising ocean temperatures prompt species to shift habitats, according to scientists. A new study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, revealing that many could find new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the long-living ocean quahog clam, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas as species' habitats change. </p>
