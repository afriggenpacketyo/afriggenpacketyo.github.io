          <p>This article reports that Hispanic shoppers are reducing their spending on groceries due to concerns about stricter immigration policies and economic anxieties, impacting companies like Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands. Executives have noted a decrease in spending on items ranging from beer to non-alcoholic beverages. The Latino unemployment rate has also seen a slight increase, further contributing to the decline in social gatherings where these products are often consumed. Coca-Cola specifically cited social media rumors and geopolitical tensions as factors affecting their sales among Hispanic consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, although they plan to offset $1 billion through remediation. The automotive industry is dealing with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts not compliant with USMCA. The company cited potential supply chain disruptions and increased tariffs as reasons for the suspension. This is a notable impact, though less than the expected impact on General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses a newly declassified memo confirming that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang. Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador, asserting the gang's actions were directed by Maduro. The memo's release contradicts the administration's rationale, leading to questions about its forceful criticism of media coverage. The Justice Department had even opened a criminal investigation into leaks related to the story, further highlighting the controversy surrounding the policy.</p>
