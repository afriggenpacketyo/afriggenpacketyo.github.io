        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More and more Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting" their jobs, prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by the Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with young employees leading the trend. This shift is driven by a desire for more personal time and a rejection of the long hours and sacrifices made by previous generations. Experts suggest that changing company practices and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic have also contributed to this new attitude towards work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the win highlighted concerns about the team's pitching depth. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was stretched thin, with nearly every reliever being used. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth inning, forcing the game into extra innings. Teoscar Hern√°ndez ultimately drove in the go-ahead run in the 13th, but the game's length could have future consequences for the Dodgers' already taxed pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans for the government to sell its rice stockpiles directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms to alleviate consumer burden amidst soaring prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores by June, bypassing auctions to ensure government control over prices. Koizumi is also exploring online sales to broaden distribution, engaging with Rakuten Group for potential collaboration. The average supermarket rice price reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, driven by poor harvests and tourism demand.</p>
