        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers involved in transporting platforms for a large-scale drone attack on Russian warplanes were unaware of their cargo's true purpose. The drones were concealed within "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, which were remotely opened to carry out the operation. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's secret services used only domestically produced weapons for the attack, avoiding the deployment of equipment from allied nations. The Ukrainian president wanted to ensure that there was a clear separation and that only Ukranian equipment was used for the operation.</p>

          <p>California is launching the CalAssist Mortgage Fund to provide up to $20,000 in mortgage relief to homeowners whose homes were severely damaged or destroyed by recent fires. The fund recognizes disasters declared as a state of emergency by the governor or a major disaster by the president between January 2023 and January 2025. Eligible homeowners can receive up to three months of mortgage payments, with the grant paid directly to their mortgage service provider. The application window opens on June 12, and funds are limited, so applications will be reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson's recent performance for England has highlighted his consistent value as a dependable player, despite being overlooked for international selection for over two years. Once a hotly-contested topic, Dawson was frequently omitted from the England squad, even after leading English spinner in the County Championship. Under new captain Harry Brook, England finally recognized that Dawson's reliability was a strength, recalling him to the team. Dawson's dependability has been a welcome addition to the team, after England had previously packed their side with pace.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of visitors attending the UK-wide Open Farm Sunday are being warned about the risk of cryptosporidium, a parasitic infection causing gastrointestinal illness. There were 17 outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis linked to farms in England and Wales in 2024, and inspection reports reveal some farms ignored health inspectors' advice. The parasite spreads through direct contact with animals or surfaces contaminated with animal feces, posing a particular risk to young children, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems. Organizers of Open Farm Sunday maintain that participating farms adhere to high health and safety standards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish of toasted bread with seasoned cheese sauce, has varied origin stories, some suggesting it started as a joke by the English. Some credit poor farmers using cheese as a meat substitute, while others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves said rarebit was associated with Welshness, with cheese being a vital part of European diets, and the name Welsh rarebit appeared much later. Despite the uncertainty, the dish remains a nostalgic comfort food enjoyed worldwide.</p>
