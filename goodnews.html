          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is poised to deliver a highly anticipated keynote address at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, expected to influence financial markets and the Fed's future policy direction. Wall Street anticipates Powell may signal a September interest rate cut, continuing a pattern of significant policy shifts indicated in past speeches. The address also comes amidst intense political pressure from the Trump administration, including attacks on Fed independence and specific officials. Powell is expected to subtly defend the central bank's autonomy while outlining views on economic conditions and potential adjustments to the Fed's long-term inflation targeting framework, possibly reverting to a more preemptive stance.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading activity as investors awaited U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual economic symposium for clues on interest rate paths. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped despite its core inflation rate cooling slightly to 3.1% in July, though still higher than expected. This figure, which excludes fresh food, marked the lowest since March, with rice inflation easing after months of surges. Overnight, U.S. stocks broadly declined for the fifth consecutive day, as Fed funds futures indicated a high likelihood of a September rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Julia Villagra, OpenAI's Chief People Officer, is departing the artificial intelligence startup, marking the latest high-profile personnel change within the rapidly evolving company. Her exit, confirmed by CNBC, occurs just months after her promotion in March and amidst OpenAI's aggressive recruitment of AI talent, facing heightened competition from industry rivals like Google and Meta. The company is concurrently deepening its push into enterprise solutions beyond its ChatGPT chatbot and undergoing a restructuring to become a public benefit corporation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously revealed that Meta had attempted to poach employees with signing bonuses as high as $100 million, underscoring the intense competition for expertise in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which strips out costs for fresh food, cooled to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month, marking its lowest level since March. However, this figure still exceeded the 3% expected by economists polled by Reuters, indicating persistent price pressures. Headline inflation also decreased to 3.1%, while the "core-core" inflation rate, excluding both fresh food and energy and closely watched by the Bank of Japan, held steady at 3.4%. A significant factor in the moderation was the easing of rice inflation to 90.7% in July, after two months of prices more than doubling. The central bank had recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the 2025 fiscal year, anticipating continued elevated price levels. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has issued new guidelines urging baby food manufacturers to significantly reduce salt and sugar levels in their products and cease promoting snacks for infants under one year old. This directive follows a BBC Panorama investigation revealing that many top-brand baby food pouches lacked key nutrients and that marketing often misled parents. Companies that fail to make their products healthier within 18 months may face further action. Health campaigners welcome the move, emphasizing that the burden of healthy eating should not solely rest on parents. The voluntary guidelines also aim to restrict unscientific health claims on packaging, though some experts express concern about potential loopholes.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, former U.S. CEO of Walmart, expressed bewilderment over the company's recent 4.5% stock drop, despite the retailer lifting its full-year sales and earnings forecast. Simon, who led Walmart U.S. from 2010 to 2014, characterized the quarter as "about as good of a quarter as any retailer could have in any environment," highlighting Walmart's ability to engage shoppers with lower prices and absorb tariffs. He suggested investors might have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss driven by restructuring costs and insurance claims, rather than systemic issues. Simon remains optimistic about Walmart's future, noting its magnetic appeal to consumers seeking value and convenience. (not investment advice)</p>

The new model boasts a 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain, offering over 500 miles per tank, a technology-filled interior, and 30% more cargo capacity. Priced starting at $36,995, the vehicle will be produced in Mexico and arrive at dealerships later this year, as Stellantis navigates market headwinds and U.S. tariffs.</p>
