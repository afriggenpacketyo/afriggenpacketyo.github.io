          <p>Ashton Jeanty, the Las Vegas Raiders' draft pick, revealed he received a prank call on draft night informing him he was being traded to the Dallas Cowboys. Jeanty, who grew up in Frisco, Texas, said he hung up on the caller, who was impersonating a team representative. The call was one of many placed to NFL prospects this year; Shedeur Sanders also received a prank call that was traced to the son of Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, resulting in fines for the team and coach. Before the draft, Jeanty had expressed his desire to play for the Cowboys.</p>

          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has voted unanimously for Greg Abel to become the company's CEO on January 1, 2026, with Warren Buffett remaining as chairman. Buffett had announced his intention to step down as CEO at the end of the year during the annual shareholder meeting. While Buffett will relinquish day-to-day operational control to Abel, his continued presence as chairman is expected to provide stability and guidance, particularly for major acquisition opportunities. Abel has been designated as Buffett's successor since 2021.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese low-cost retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption. This exemption allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but its removal means Temu's products now face tariffs as high as 145%. As a result, Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all U.S. sales now handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from within the country. The company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, aiming to help local merchants reach more customers.</p>

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff is seeking re-election in 2026 in a state that has shifted back to Republican control. Ossoff is balancing his criticism of Donald Trump with a willingness to work with Republicans on issues important to Georgia, such as supporting farmers and military bases. While Ossoff has been critical of Trump's attempts to use the federal government to target critics, he also emphasizes his commitment to delivering for Georgia by finding common ground with the administration. Ossoff faces the challenge of appealing to a broad electorate while maintaining his Democratic base, particularly after recent controversies involving his stance on Israel and party leadership.</p>

          <p>Greg Abel is set to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a decision Buffett announced at the company's annual shareholder gathering.

          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry indicates that more American adults with mental health needs are receiving talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications without therapy has declined. The study, led by Dr. Mark Olfson, found that the number of adults receiving psychotherapy increased from 6.5% in 2018 to 8.5% in 2021. The increase in talk therapy access may be linked to the expansion of telehealth and a greater awareness of mental health, although the study also found that affluent individuals benefited the most from this increased access.</p>

Michelladonna's show has gained popularity both in and outside of New York, and has led to a fundraiser to cover veterinary care for these unofficial workers, as they are technically illegal.

Cyber security experts recommend implementing multi-factor authentication and using code words to verify the legitimacy of staff members requesting credential changes.</p>
