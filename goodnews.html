          <p>The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market is bracing for a "natural demand" test as federal incentives of up to $7,500 expire after Tuesday. Automakers and analysts anticipate a significant decline in EV sales in the coming months, despite a record third quarter driven by buyers pulling purchases forward. Industry leaders like GM's CFO and Tesla's Elon Musk foresee a temporary dip before the market stabilizes. The end of these incentives, part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is expected to reshape the market, making lower-priced models even more crucial for sustained growth.

This milestone underscores increasing investor confidence in China's ongoing capital market liberalization efforts. It further solidifies Hong Kong's position as the premier offshore yuan hub, as Chinese bonds continue to offer attractive diversification benefits and relative market stability.

Interest rates, geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies also significantly impact its value.

While the U.S. East Coast can expect swells causing life-threatening surf and rip currents, direct landfall on the mainland is not anticipated.

He notes that the "traditional" dad is a relatively modern concept, shaped significantly by post-World War II television. From Ward Cleaver's archetypal 1950s suburban dad to the "anti-heroes" of 21st-century prestige dramas, TV dads have mirrored societal changes in masculinity and parenting.
