          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from using National Guard or other military forces for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling, by Judge Charles Breyer, found that the deployment of troops to Los Angeles willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law. While the decision is currently stayed to allow for an appeal, the judge warned that such actions could create a "national police force with the President as its chief," setting a significant legal precedent against the militarization of domestic streets.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have signed an open letter defending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the central bank's independence from political pressure. The letter comes in response to President Trump's attempt to remove Cook from her position over what the economists call "unproven accusations" of mortgage fraud. They argue that such actions threaten the institutional safeguards that underpin U.S. economic strength by injecting political risk into monetary policy. The signatories warned that weakening the Fed's autonomy could lead to higher interest rates for families and businesses.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price showed resilience, rising to reclaim the $111,000 level while the broader stock market experienced a downturn. The move occurred as gold reached a new record high, driven by geopolitical uncertainty and expectations of interest rate cuts. This divergence suggests some investors may be treating Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, similar to gold, although it has also faced headwinds from a market rotation into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The market activity indicates investors are seeking both safety and yield, with cryptocurrencies increasingly competing with traditional assets during periods of economic instability.

The current jackpot has been growing for 41 consecutive drawings since it was last won in California on May 31.

          <p>Eli Lilly's stock received a positive outlook from BMO Capital after the company announced successful clinical trial results for its weight loss drug, orforglipron. The ATTAIN-2 study demonstrated significant placebo-adjusted weight loss in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, potentially positioning the drug for an FDA filing by year-end. Analysts believe orforglipron could strengthen Eli Lilly's competitive position in the lucrative weight loss market. The positive data has reset investor expectations following less impressive results from a previous trial, signaling strong growth potential for the pharmaceutical giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, analysts noted that China and Russia have significant room to expand their trade relationship, particularly in goods and services settled in their local currencies. Despite a recent slowdown in Chinese automotive exports to Russia, demand remains high for Chinese consumer goods and electronics, which are difficult for Russia to import from the West due to sanctions. The two nations signed over 20 bilateral agreements covering energy, aerospace, and agriculture. This deepening partnership is seen as a strategic move to create alternative markets as both countries face increasing trade pressure from the United States.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent New York Democrat, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. The 78-year-old lawmaker stated his decision was influenced by the need for a "generational change" within the Democratic party, citing the collapse of Joe Biden's 2024 presidential bid as a key factor. Nadler, who served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee and led two impeachments of Donald Trump, believes a younger replacement could better help the party combat what he termed Trump's "incipient fascism." His retirement is expected to open up a crowded primary for his safe Democratic seat.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has blocked the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate, citing concerns about his mental competency. Menzies' attorneys argued that his severe dementia prevents him from understanding why he is being executed, a key legal standard for capital punishment. Menzies, who was convicted of a 1986 murder, had chosen to be executed by firing squad. The court's decision requires a lower court to reevaluate his fitness for execution, upholding constitutional principles against cruel and unusual punishment while acknowledging the prolonged suffering for the victim's family.</p>

Polanski, who has a background as an actor and hypnotherapist, aims to connect with voters on an emotional level and has vowed to "take the fight to Labour." His election could open the door to collaboration with a new left-wing party being formed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones equipped with loudspeakers to scare gray wolves away from cattle along the California-Oregon border. The drones blast a variety of sounds, including heavy metal music like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices, to haze the predators. This nonlethal technique was developed by USDA researchers to reduce conflicts between the recovering wolf population and ranchers. While the technology is expensive and its long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results show success in interrupting wolf hunts and providing a new tool for wildlife management.</p>
