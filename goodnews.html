          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain an attractive savings option, with current interest rates generally between 4% and 5%. This article outlines the potential interest earnings on a $75,000 deposit across various CD terms, from three months to five years. Due to their fixed rates, CDs offer predictable returns and are FDIC-insured, providing security against market fluctuations and potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The calculations show earnings ranging from nearly $800 for a 3-month term to over $16,900 for a 5-year term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 14:09:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has broadened its employee discount program to include nearly all grocery items, offering its 1.6 million U.S. workers a 10% reduction on food staples like milk and meat. This expansion comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, a possibility Walmart's own CFO has acknowledged. The move is seen as a way to support its workforce financially while also encouraging them to shop in-store, thereby boosting Walmart's own sales. The enhanced benefit, one of the most requested by employees, is effective immediately for staff who have passed their 90-day probationary period.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while major tech stocks saw a slight decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, which often rely on borrowing for operations and expansion, and could also stimulate consumer spending. The shift reflects a broader economic sentiment, with many voices, including the Treasury Secretary, advocating for monetary easing to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant stock price drop, Wall Street sentiment is turning positive again for cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. The initial decline was a reaction to the company's $25 billion offer to acquire CyberArk, which some investors viewed as too expensive. However, analysts from firms like Deutsche Bank and Piper Sandler are now upgrading the stock, citing the strategic value of adding CyberArk's identity security capabilities to Palo Alto's platform. This move is seen as filling a critical gap and enhancing the company's "platformization" strategy to consolidate cybersecurity services for enterprise clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated there are no current plans to stage official league matches outside of England. His comments come as other European leagues, such as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A, explore playing fixtures in the United States and Australia. The Premier League had previously considered an extra "39th game" abroad in 2008 but shelved the idea after backlash from fans. Masters explained that while the goal was international growth, the league has achieved this through other means like broadcasting partnerships and preseason tours, making the controversial concept unnecessary.</p>

          <h2>Key Considerations for Negotiating Credit Card Debt Relief Independently</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 13:40:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are exploring debt relief options. This article examines the pros and cons of negotiating directly with creditors versus hiring a professional debt relief company. While a DIY approach avoids fees and keeps the borrower in control, it requires significant preparation, persistence, and knowledge of debt collection laws. Individuals must be ready for stressful conversations and understand the potential negative impacts on their credit score and tax situation, as forgiven debt can be considered taxable income. The complexity of the process may make professional help a worthwhile consideration for some.</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like meat, produce, and dairy in more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The service, free for Prime members on orders over $25, allows customers to add perishable items to their regular Amazon carts alongside electronics or books. The move intensifies competition with rivals like Instacart and Walmart, whose stock prices dipped following the announcement.

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis legend Venus Williams has been awarded a wildcard to compete in the US Open, making her the oldest singles player in the tournament in 44 years. This marks her record-extending 25th appearance at her home Grand Slam, where she is a two-time champion. Williams returned to the sport in July after a 16-month hiatus, winning a match at the Washington Open and proving she can still compete at a high level. While some may argue the wildcard spot could have gone to a younger player, it offers the seven-time major champion a chance to compete on one of tennis's biggest stages once again.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore part of the $584 million in federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles. The judge ruled that the suspension by the National Science Foundation violated a previous injunction that prohibited the agency from terminating grants within the University of California system. The funding freeze was part of a broader administration action against universities following pro-Palestinian campus protests, which the government alleges allowed antisemitism. The university and critics have raised concerns about free speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The probability of Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos being nominated as the next Federal Reserve chair has risen significantly on prediction markets. This surge follows a report that the Trump administration is considering him among 11 potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell. On the Kalshi prediction market, Zervos's odds jumped to tie with former front-runner Kevin Warsh. The speculation highlights the administration's search for a candidate who aligns with its preference for lower interest rates, a stance for which President Trump has frequently criticized the current Fed leadership.</p>
