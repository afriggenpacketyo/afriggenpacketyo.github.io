        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black is set to be a fiercely contested event, with Europe striving for their first away victory since 2012 against a US team slightly favored by bookmakers. Critical factors for European success include securing strong early leads, effectively managing the notoriously boisterous New York crowd, and leveraging their squad's greater playing experience. European captain Luke Donald's calm demeanor and successful track record contrast with US captain Keegan Bradley's recent public gaffes. The anticipated presence of former President Donald Trump is expected to further intensify the already electric atmosphere, highlighting the pivotal role of the opening sessions in shaping the tournament's outcome and the teams' potential legacies.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP's shares have risen over 32% since April, outperforming rivals and diminishing previous takeover speculation. This positive shift is attributed to a strategic reset, a leadership change, cost-cutting progress, and recent oil discoveries. Earlier in the year, BP was a rumored target for companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil, but CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized a focus on growth. This article highlights improved market sentiment and recent financial successes, including stronger second-quarter results and significant oil and gas finds, suggesting a renewed confidence in the company's independent trajectory.
