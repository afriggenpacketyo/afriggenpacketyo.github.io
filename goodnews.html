          <p>Vietnam veterans in Iowa, now in their 80s, received their high school diplomas over six decades after leaving school early to serve in the war. Dennis Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy before his junior year, always wanted to graduate from Muscatine High School, and his dream was realized through Operation Recognition, a program by the Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs. Snyder and fellow veteran Richard Hill joined the Muscatine High class of 2025, receiving their diplomas and recognition for their service. Snyder shared the honor with friends who died in Vietnam, believing more veterans deserve this recognition.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages using non-invasive methods. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, detected changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early treatment. The test is considered vital in areas with limited medical resources, potentially improving cancer detection rates and outcomes.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Chinese Wisdom Helps Decode Yeast Cell Life Cycles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Led by Professor Li Lei, the study redefines yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine, offering new insights into molecular life mechanisms. The team's work, published in NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, highlights the balance between passive and active forces in maintaining cellular health.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, which is seen as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is navigating a minority government on the national political stage. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the Liberal Democratic Party is aiming to retain its seats, despite low approval ratings for Ishiba's Cabinet. Key issues include support for households grappling with inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke.</p>

          <p>After their son Blaze Bernstein was murdered by a neo-Nazi, his parents, Jeanne Pepper and Gideon Bernstein, transformed their grief into a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward." Blaze, a gay, Jewish man, was targeted and killed because of his identity. The couple promotes positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, with hand-painted stones carrying messages of tolerance and peace placed in Borrego Park, where he was murdered. The stones serve as a memorial to Blaze's life and a symbol of hope for a better future, inspiring others to be kinder and repair the world.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets" to revitalize the country's housing market amid declining prices and subdued buyer sentiment. These platforms, both online and offline, aim to make homebuying more transparent and efficient. Chengdu is the latest city to launch such a platform, partnering with state-owned and private developers to feature over 50 projects. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, offering services such as mortgage applications and property registration to improve transaction efficiency.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband Bob was overturned after spending two decades in prison, following new examinations of evidence by Loyola Project for the Innocent. New DNA testing revealed foreign male DNA on items and inconsistencies in blood evidence, prompting the prosecution to concede issues with the original trial. Despite the overturned conviction, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again if new evidence surfaces. Dorotik, now working to rebuild her life, advocates for incarcerated women and questions the systemic issues that led to her wrongful conviction.</p>
