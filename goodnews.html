          <p>Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) CEO Lee Shi Ruh affirmed the integrated resort's readiness for its 2026 casino license renewal, despite Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority granting only a two-year extension in 2024 due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance. Undeterred, RWS is proceeding with its S$6.8 billion expansion plans, which include recently opened attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. The company's strategic focus is on transforming RWS into a premium lifestyle destination, prioritizing unique visitor experiences over traditional shopping, with additional hotels and attractions slated for launch through 2030. This commitment underscores their ambition to enhance appeal despite regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Six years after Chinese scientist He Jiankui's controversial announcement of the first gene-edited babies, which sparked global condemnation for its reckless and unethical use of the then-nascent CRISPR technology, the field of gene-editing for human reproduction is seeing renewed development efforts. Despite the initial backlash, some companies are now actively pursuing advancements in this technology. NPR science correspondent Rob Stein has closely followed this evolving and highly contentious area, noting that these quests to push gene-editing forward continue to raise profound and complex ethical questions about the future of human genetic modification and its societal implications.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, averting a looming escalation of tariffs between the world's two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to prolong the truce until November 10, maintaining current tariff rates while both sides engage in further negotiations. This extension aims to address persistent trade imbalances, rectify perceived unfair trade practices, and enhance market access for U.S. exporters in China, alongside broader discussions on national security and economic concerns. Despite this temporary reprieve, a U.S. business owner voiced ongoing uncertainty, as trade flows have already significantly decreased this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prolific striker Robert Lewandowski revealed he "said yes" to a move to Manchester United in 2012, a transfer that ultimately fell through as Borussia Dortmund refused to sell him. Despite not playing in the Premier League, the 37-year-old expressed immense satisfaction with his stellar career at clubs like Bayern Munich and Barcelona, where he won major titles. Lewandowski, who has scored over 700 career goals, plans no immediate retirement and continues to learn from younger talents like Lamine Yamal. He also shared how former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp profoundly influenced his personal and professional development, helping him to overcome emotional barriers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' lead in the National League West has significantly narrowed to just one game following a 7-4 defeat to the Angels, a game marked by pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's worst major league start. Yamamoto conceded six runs in less than five innings, struggling with his rhythm and control from the first pitch. The Dodgers' offense also largely faltered, managing only two hits through six innings against Angels pitcher José Soriano, reflecting a broader team slump since early July. This loss adds to a season increasingly characterized by frustration and inconsistency, as the team grapples with injuries and struggles to meet championship expectations.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Lula da Silva engaged in a phone call where Xi underscored the unprecedented strength of their bilateral relations and advocated for their nations to collectively set an example of solidarity and self-reliance for the Global South. This significant discussion, initiated by Lula, took place as Washington concurrently extended a 90-day pause on tariffs for Chinese goods, thereby highlighting a notable divergence in the U.S.'s trade treatment of Beijing compared to Brasilia. The call signifies a concerted effort to deepen ties between China and Brazil, particularly amidst the backdrop of shifting global trade dynamics and the strategic implications of U.S. economic policies.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian firm Wild Hornets has unveiled a video showcasing its Sting interceptor drone achieving speeds of up to 195 miles per hour, positioning it as potentially one of the fastest first-person-view combat drones. This remarkable speed is critical for effectively intercepting Iranian-designed Shahed drones, which Russia is increasingly deploying in large numbers to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The low-cost Sting, priced at $2,500, has already reportedly destroyed approximately 100 Shahed drones, contributing significantly to Ukraine's ambitious goal of producing 1,000 interceptor drones daily. This technological advancement offers a vital solution to counter Russia's evolving drone tactics and bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, who has served as CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, is departing from his position, with no immediate successor announced, amidst escalating competition in the burgeoning market for AI-powered coding tools. Dohmke, who plans to stay until the end of the year to facilitate the transition, expressed his desire to "become a founder again." GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, pioneered its AI coding assistant Copilot in 2021 and has reported substantial growth in its developer base. However, the sector is witnessing a rapid emergence of new competitors in "vibe coding," challenging GitHub's initial lead in AI development.</p>

          <p>Wang Yiming, a prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, has urged the government to implement balanced guidance for the nation's intensely competitive e-commerce sector, rather than simply curbing competition. He emphasized that "quick commerce," with its rapid delivery services, presents significant opportunities for new consumption and long-term economic growth. Wang advocates for targeted policy measures to foster high-quality development, promoting a shift from a "zero-sum mindset" to a "win-win approach" through innovation, quality enhancements, and a stronger industrial ecosystem. This strategy aims to combat "neijuan," or excessive internal competition, by elevating the overall market dynamic.</p>
