        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China successfully conducted the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a crucial step towards its lunar ambitions in 2030. The test involved a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines ignited while grounded, simulating an emergency during launch. The return capsule reached the designated altitude, separated cleanly from the escape tower, and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag system. This safety verification ensures crew survival during potential rocket failures at liftoff, marking China's first such test since 1998, when a similar trial was conducted for the Shenzhou spacecraft program.</p>

          <p>Honda, Japan's second-largest carmaker, announced the successful test of an experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, aiming for suborbital space flight by 2029. The rocket reached an altitude of nearly 300 meters before landing successfully, showcasing Honda's technologies amassed from various products and automated driving systems. Honda sees growing demand for satellite launch rockets due to increasing expectations for a "data system in outer space." While there are no firm plans for commercialization, Honda believes this technology could contribute to people's lives through satellite launches compatible with other Honda businesses. This move aligns with Japan's broader push to become a major player in satellite launches, with government subsidies encouraging startups in reusable rocket technology.</p>

The grocery chain stated it has not fully recovered from the incident. While the offer aims to attract customers back, some analysts believe it may not appeal to many due to the high spending threshold. A Co-op source indicated that stock levels have returned to normal, and the offer is a proactive measure ahead of summer trading, though some suggest it is an attempt to regain customer loyalty after the breach.</p>

Despite spirited support at Seattle's Lumen Field, Urawa's defensive lapses cost them the match.

Matsuo noted that the match hinged on small details, and the team will need to improve their defense to advance in the tournament, where they face Italian giants Inter Milan next.</p>

Despite Meta's efforts, Altman claims that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted the offers. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly frustrated with his company's AI progress and is investing heavily to assemble a leading AI team for its "superintelligence" lab. This comes after Meta delayed the release of its latest AI model due to capability concerns, and Zuckerberg is prepared to invest billions in top AI talent.</p>

While blood donation rules will be updated in 2026, the plasma donation rules will take effect on July 14, with new guidelines focusing on anal sex with new or multiple partners, requiring a three-month waiting period. This change reflects research indicating no impact on blood and plasma safety, and aims to address the rising global demand for plasma.</p>
