          <p>The Walt Disney Company and Miral have partnered to develop a Disney theme park and resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, marking Disney's seventh theme park destination. Miral will handle the full development and construction, while Disney's Imagineers will lead the creative design and operational oversight. This project is separate from Disney's $60 billion investment in its existing theme parks and aims to tap into the region's growing tourism market, with about one-third of the world's population within a four-hour flight of the UAE. The new park will feature themed accommodations, unique dining, and retail experiences, blending Disney's storytelling with Abu Dhabi's culture and futuristic elements.</p>

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora has cautioned that U.S. tariffs could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry sector.

Pandora, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, had previously warned of a potential revenue hit due to President Trump's tariff announcements, however, the impact on consumer pricing will likely be industry-led.</p>
