          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have added bullpen depth and a versatile outfielder at the trade deadline, acquiring relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase, along with outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that while the moves were not for top-market players, they effectively raise the team's overall floor and provide valuable support. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage relief option, while Call is expected to provide tough at-bats and solid defense. The organization remains hopeful that the most significant improvements will come from its existing star players performing more consistently through the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>This article explores the characteristics of cults and provides guidance on how to recognize their manipulative tactics, featuring insights from a psychotherapist who is a cult survivor herself. It explains that cults are not always religious and can form around any ideology by using coercive control, an 'us-versus-them' mentality, and love bombing to recruit and retain members. Key red flags discussed include the promise of simple answers to complex problems, the use of specialized language to create an in-group, and high barriers to exit. The piece also calls for more specialized mental health support and legal protections for those who leave such groups.</p>

          <h2>ByteDance Reveals Median Employee Tenure of Nearly Three Years</h2>

          <p>TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. This data, shared with its 120,000 employees, suggests that about half of the workforce has been with the social media giant for over three years. The figures appear to counter online speculation of high turnover and indicate relatively strong employee retention within China's competitive tech industry. This announcement follows the company's move away from the intense "996" work culture in 2021 to a more standard work schedule.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Alex Bessent has indicated that recent negotiations with Chinese officials in Stockholm have advanced discussions, expressing optimism about reaching a beneficial deal. In a statement, Bessent credited the strong relationship between President Trump and President Xi for the positive trajectory of the talks. While a Chinese commerce official suggested that a pause on new tariff increases would be extended, the Trump administration has not yet confirmed this and has delivered mixed messages on the matter. The statement suggests movement in the ongoing trade dispute, though specific details of any potential agreement remain undisclosed by the U.S. side.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus, without fully considering the current conditions in those countries. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and has stated its intention to appeal.</p>

After failing to appear for state charges, Singh was arrested by the FBI at an airport while attempting to fly to India, and he now faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Free agent wide receiver Keenan Allen is scheduled to meet with the Los Angeles Chargers to explore a potential return to the team where he played for 11 seasons. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap measure. The Chargers are reportedly in need of a veteran receiving presence following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. A reunion would bring back one of the franchise's most productive receivers to work again with quarterback Justin Herbert, potentially bolstering their offense with a familiar and reliable target.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has indicated it is likely to find President Trump's order restricting birthright citizenship unconstitutional, expressing strong skepticism during oral arguments. The three-judge panel questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not automatically grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, citing a long-standing Supreme Court precedent. This follows a similar ruling from another federal appeals court and suggests the policy's ultimate fate will be decided by the Supreme Court. Every court to have considered the order, which was issued in January, has so far declared it unconstitutional.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has narrowed the path for mass compensation claims over hidden commissions in car finance deals but did not completely absolve lenders. The court rejected the argument that dealers have a primary duty of loyalty to customers, which could have triggered billions in claims. However, the ruling upheld one claim where the commission was deemed unfair under the Consumer Credit Act, providing a potential template for future cases. This article analyzes the legal and financial implications, suggesting that while the industry avoided a worst-case scenario, lenders could still face substantial redress payments, particularly concerning now-banned discretionary commission arrangements.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who were legally paroled into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons. The ruling could significantly curtail the administration's efforts to ramp up deportations, including the controversial practice of arresting migrants at their immigration court hearings for expedited removal. The judge found the government's actions to be illegal, noting that the targeted individuals had "played by the rules" by entering with permission and attending their hearings. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, though the government is expected to appeal.</p>
