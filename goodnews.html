          <p>Nearly six decades after the initial moon landing, space agencies and commercial entities are refocusing on the moon, envisioning it as a crucial stepping stone for missions to Mars. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, while China and Russia plan to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, potentially making lunar bases self-sufficient and serving as refueling stations for Mars-bound astronauts.</p>

          <h2>Restaurant Consultant Shares Dining Etiquette Tips for Customers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 07:00:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A restaurant consultant revealed some unwritten rules of etiquette for dining out, including avoiding "one-timing" a server by placing multiple requests at once and using a polite wave to get their attention. It's also important to understand that mistakes can happen in the kitchen, and customers should approach issues calmly rather than blaming the server immediately. The appropriate time to remain at a table after finishing a meal is about two to two-and-a-half hours for fine dining and one to one-and-45 minutes for casual dining. It is also courteous to place your first order shortly after being seated.</p>

          <p>A major international trial shows that an exercise programme for colon cancer patients can cut the risk of dying by a third. The three-year exercise programme started soon after chemotherapy, with the aim of getting people doing at least double the amount of exercise set out in the guidelines for the general population. Results showed a 28% reduction in the risk of the cancer coming back, and a 37% lower risk of death. Scientists are already investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer.</p>

          <p>Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual is seeking to expand its operations in Asia, focusing on opportunities arising from the growing demand for data centers among Chinese AI firms. This expansion aligns with the strengthening trade and investment ties between China and Brazil. BTG partner Jo√£o Scandiuzzi said the bank was considering opening a new office in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong visit was part of a broader roadshow in China, where BTG executives toured major cities with Brazilian entrepreneurs and family offices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is on the verge of mandating a phonics-based approach to reading instruction in schools, a significant shift driven by persistently low test scores. A sweeping bill moving through the Legislature will require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the ‚Äúscience of reading,‚Äù from transitional kindergarten through third grade. The bill is the capstone to decades of debate and controversy in California on how best to teach reading. The science of reading consists of five pillars: phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.</p>

The documentary touches on dozens of music-related moments, not just the celebrated live performances that became pivotal for everything from hip-hop to punk but sketches, guest appearances by stars and the cast‚Äôs own formidable inventions like the Blues Brothers.</p>
