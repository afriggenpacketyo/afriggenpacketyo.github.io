          <p>Authorities apprehended Vance Luther Boelter on Sunday, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Minnesota Democratic state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, which was described as a politically motivated assassination. Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack on Saturday morning, with the couple reported to be in stable condition. Law enforcement located what they believe to be the suspect's vehicle in Sibley County, Minnesota, finding "items of evidence" relevant to the investigation. Over 100 law enforcement officers and SWAT teams were involved in the search leading to Boelter's capture. Optimism surrounding the capture of the suspect brings a sense of relief to the reeling state of Minnesota. </p>

          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light. Industry groups are attempting to mediate between concerned locals and the tech companies building these facilities. In Hino, Tokyo, a proposed five-story data center faces opposition due to its height exceeding city ordinances. Some municipalities, like Tokyo's Koto Ward, are implementing regulations requiring earlier construction announcements and clear indications of heat-emitting units. The situation highlights the challenges of balancing technological infrastructure needs with community concerns. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, with a 6.4% year-on-year increase in May, surpassing analysts' expectations. The growth was partly attributed to the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the government's consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed slightly, and property investment continued to contract. While retail sales showed strength, falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. </p>

          <h2>Claims of Increased Business Investment Evaluated</h2>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has claimed significant business investment during his tenure, but the accuracy of these claims is being scrutinized. While government statistics show a jump in business investment early in Trump's tenure, analysts suggest this may be skewed by earlier events. Some companies, like Roche, have announced investment plans, but executives have warned that some of Trump's policies could impact these plans. Exaggeration by politicians and companies is common, especially with the Trump administration's interventionist economic policies. </p>
