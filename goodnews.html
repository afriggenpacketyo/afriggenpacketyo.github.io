          <p>Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate supported by left-wing opposition parties, achieved a significant victory in Ireland's presidential election, securing over 64.7% of the vote. Her campaign focused on messages of "peace," "unity," and "neutrality," even as her past criticisms of the United States and the European Union's military spending and roles in conflicts like Gaza are expected to create tension with Ireland's center-right government. The election itself was marked by a low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, indicating deep public anger and dissatisfaction with all major parties and their handling of issues such as immigration. This article highlights Connolly's win as she prepares to succeed Michael D. Higgins after his two terms, representing a notable shift in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced for significant off-year elections, including the New York City mayoral and New Jersey gubernatorial races, which are being closely watched as potential indicators for the Democratic party's future direction. New York's mayoral contest pits progressive Zohran Mamdani against Republican Curtis Sliwa and independent Andrew Cuomo, focusing on issues like affordability and exposing internal Democratic divisions. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill debated topics ranging from the federal government shutdown to the state's high cost of living. This article notes that these elections, alongside Virginia's governor's race, underscore prevalent national political and cultural debates.</p>

          <p>The article explores the growing "sleepmaxxing" industry, valued at $29.3 billion, which offers advanced technologies like Eight Sleep's smart mattress covers for optimal rest. However, these systems are vulnerable to glitches, as demonstrated when an AWS cloud outage left users stuck in uncomfortable sleep settings. While some sleep tech, like NightWare for PTSD nightmares, offers therapeutic benefits, many consumer gadgets' effectiveness remains an open question, often encouraging better sleep hygiene rather than direct improvement. This article questions the reliance on technology for a basic human function, highlighting potential points of failure and the industry's rapid expansion.</p>

          <p>Despite considerable industry panic and the recent launch of advanced tools like OpenAI's Sora 2, artificial intelligence has not yet profoundly disrupted Hollywood, especially concerning job displacement or significantly reducing filmmaking costs. The article notes that major studio investments in AI, such as Disney's reported $50 million venture, have not delivered anticipated efficiencies, and legal departments are grappling with copyright ambiguities. While some low-budget productions are leveraging AI for visual effects, high-caliber Hollywood productions continue to face challenges integrating the technology due to technical complexities, security concerns, and talent resistance. This article suggests that while AI's transformative potential is acknowledged, its widespread, disruptive impact on the entertainment industry remains a future prospect.</p>

          <h2>Activist Investor Starboard Seeks to Unlock Value in Fluor's NuScale Holdings</h2>

          <p>Activist investor Starboard Value has acquired a nearly 5% position in Fluor, with the explicit goal of unlocking significant value from Fluor's substantial 39% holding in NuScale Power, a nuclear technology company. This stake, valued at approximately $4.3 billion, accounts for over 60% of Fluor's current market capitalization, yet the market appears to undervalue Fluor's core engineering, procurement, and construction services business. Starboard proposes monetizing the NuScale stake through various methods, including open-market sales or a tax-free spinoff, which could fund substantial share buybacks or lead to a re-rating of Fluor's core business. This article highlights Starboard's strategic approach to leverage its proven activist track record and its existing relationship with Fluor's executive chairman to maximize shareholder returns.
