          <p>A recent survey has shed light on the Chinese public's complex and often nuanced perspectives regarding the country's rivalry with the United States, as well as its relationships with allies like Russia and North Korea. Contrary to common American beliefs that China aims to supplant the US, the survey found that a substantial 48% of Chinese respondents prefer a shared global leadership role, suggesting potential avenues for reducing bilateral tensions. Experts highlight the flexibility in these views, though the study's authors caution that self-censorship and monitoring concerns likely influenced some of the reported findings. This article underscores the intricate nature of public sentiment on these critical geopolitical issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court's decision that deemed many of its tariffs illegal, warning that the ruling threatens to "unilaterally disarm the United States." The Justice Department argues that denying the President tariff authority would expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies and risk economic catastrophe, asserting the tariffs are vital for national security and economic prosperity. This appeal follows a Federal Circuit ruling that found Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration is pushing for an expedited resolution, emphasizing the critical role tariffs play in diplomacy and protecting American industry.</p>

          <p>China has launched a 14-day civil aviation management capacity enhancement workshop in Beijing, hosting 20 participants from eight Southeast Asian countries, as part of its strategy to promote home-grown civilian aircraft like the C919. This initiative aims to deepen economic cooperation within the region and challenge the dominant duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the global large jet market. The comprehensive training program covers critical areas such as safety management, airworthiness certification, green development, and new aviation technologies. With its C909 regional jets already established in Southeast Asia, China is actively working to expand its influence and market share in the international aviation sector.</p>

          <p>Xiaohongshu, a popular Chinese social media platform often likened to Instagram, has experienced a remarkable 19% surge in its valuation over just three months, now standing at US$31 billion. This substantial increase, disclosed through portfolio documents from a GSR Ventures Management vehicle, underscores robust investor demand for the app, known as RedNote in the US. The platform has garnered significant traction, particularly after the Chinese government pledged support for private firms, which has reinvigorated confidence in the nation's start-up landscape. This rapid growth positions Xiaohongshu as a formidable competitor in the social media space, especially amid regulatory uncertainties faced by platforms like TikTok.</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously contemplating a return to the Senate in New Hampshire, a move reportedly blessed by senior White House officials. As a member of the influential Sununu political dynasty, he is considered a prime recruit for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, especially with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen not seeking re-election. New Hampshire has historically proven a difficult state for GOP Senate candidates. Sununu, who previously served one term, indicated he would decide by the end of next month, aiming to garner broad support across the political spectrum, including from President Trump.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its 2022 demotion of Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson, reinstating his retired rank of rear admiral, a decision confirmed by Navy Secretary John Phelan. This action overturns a previous demotion that stemmed from a Pentagon inspector general investigation into Jackson's conduct as White House physician, which included allegations of "sexual and denigrating" comments and alcohol policy violations. Jackson, who served Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, consistently denied these allegations, labeling them a "political hit job." The reinstatement acknowledges Jackson's decades of distinguished naval service and aligns with a broader trend of the Pentagon being more transparent in extending considerations to supporters of President Trump.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during World War Two, has been successfully recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at around $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before it was seized by the Nazis and later acquired by Hermann Göring. The painting's whereabouts remained unknown until it was spotted in an online real estate listing in Argentina by journalists investigating Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who had fled to the country. This discovery led to police raids and the eventual handover of the artwork, with charges of concealment and obstruction of justice filed against Kadgien's relatives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, declaring it an illegal, "ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities." Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the administration acted in retaliation against Harvard for its refusal to meet demands that infringed upon First Amendment protections. This decision vacates the funding freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, including those on tuberculosis and NASA astronauts' radiation exposure. While acknowledging Harvard's need to address antisemitism, the judge concluded that the administration's "true aim" was not to combat antisemitism but rather to target universities based on ideological grounds.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's application of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, concluding there was "no invasion or predatory incursion." The Fifth Circuit panel explicitly rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" met the legal definition of an invasion, stating it was not equivalent to an armed, organized force. This decision grants a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of the Act for the migrants who filed suit, although other legal avenues for their removal are still available to the government. The ruling represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's controversial immigration enforcement strategy.</p>
