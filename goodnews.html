          <p>Australia is set to become the first country globally to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, a move that will also ease restrictions on blood donations from gay and bisexual men. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Under the new rules, donors will be asked about anal sex with new or multiple partners, rather than their sexual orientation. This decision aims to reduce stigma and increase the supply of much-needed blood and plasma.</p>

The ruling allows transgender and non-binary people to obtain passports that align with their gender identity, reducing potential distress and discrimination.</p>
