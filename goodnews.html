          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment despite previous opposition to the buyout. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain controlled by the USA, ensuring job security and maintaining existing facilities. He also announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, citing national security concerns. The deal, still pending final approval, aims to make U.S. Steel more competitive globally, creating the world's third-largest steelmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, but their travel habits are changing. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, travelers are now seeking immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The shift is driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, who prefer family trips over group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is working to target this market, including opening an account on a popular Chinese social media platform. </p>
