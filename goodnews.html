        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to exclusive data from JLL, investor interest in the U.S. office market has significantly recovered, with transaction volume rising 42% year-over-year to $25.9 billion in the first half of 2025. This rebound is driven by lower interest rates and a "flight to quality," where top-tier buildings see the most demand, though secondary properties are expected to gain traction. The report indicates a shift from investor curiosity to serious commitment, supported by a sharp drop in new construction and stabilizing corporate downsizing, suggesting a stronger outlook for office real estate valuations.

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Humberto in the central tropical Atlantic, the eighth named storm of the season. Currently moving west-northwest with sustained winds of 45 mph, the storm is expected to strengthen over the next several days due to favorable conditions. While there are no immediate coastal warnings, forecasters are monitoring its path for potential downstream impacts on the U.S. Southeast coast. A second weather system is also developing over the Caribbean, which could bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to grow savings, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. Online banks typically offer the most competitive rates, often exceeding national averages, due to lower overhead costs. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs (like 6-month or 1-year terms) presently offer higher annual percentage yields than longer-term options. To maximize returns, experts suggest comparing offers from various online institutions and considering a laddering strategy for long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

This positive data comes shortly after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, citing rising risks to employment. Other economic indicators also showed strength, with second-quarter GDP growth revised up to 3.8% and durable goods orders increasing unexpectedly in August. Despite this resilience, markets still anticipate further rate cuts from the Fed later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has opened the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) a week earlier than its expected October 1 launch date. Experts view this early release as a significant benefit for college-bound students, as it allows more time to apply for federal aid like grants, loans, and work-study programs. Given last year's delays and glitches with the new form, which led to a drop in completion rates, this timely opening is a welcome development. Filing early is crucial, as some financial aid is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

          <p>This article details five common overpayment scams where fraudsters send a victim a counterfeit check for more than an agreed-upon amount and then request the difference be sent back. These schemes target various situations, including dog walking services, online marketplace sales, mystery shopper jobs, rental deposits, and work-from-home equipment purchases. To avoid falling victim, individuals should never forward money from an overpayment, verify funds have fully cleared with their bank, and be wary of urgent requests.

The research, conducted by Arizona State University economists, shows the U.S. Latino GDP grew by 50% since 2015, far outpacing the 17% growth for non-Latinos. This economic expansion is attributed to rising education levels, entrepreneurship, and labor force participation.
