          <p>Johnny 5, the youngest son of the late Jenni Rivera, has released his debut EP titled "5 por 5," which features five songs blending corridos with experimental sounds. Working with producer Ulises Lozano, Johnny 5 incorporates elements of regional Mexican music with alternative and rock influences. One track, "72," is a tribute to his mother, Jenni Rivera, who passed away when he was 11 years old. Johnny 5 expresses that making music has helped him heal from past traumas, including the death of his father, and he hopes his work can resonate with others facing similar struggles.

          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in Game 1 of the NCAA Super Regionals. Despite UTSA's strong start with an early home run, UCLA responded with consistent hitting and solid defense. Pitcher Michael Barnett limited the damage, while Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning provided a crucial cushion. The Bruins' defensive clinic and timely hitting bring them one step closer to Omaha and the College World Series, which is a positive sign for the team's trajectory.

          <p>China is making strides in its plan to become a football superpower by 2050, focusing on grassroots development. Over the past decade, the country has added thousands of pitches and introduced football courses in schools nationwide.

While the men's national team's ranking has declined, these investments in grassroots football show a commitment to long-term development and a potential for future success.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is grappling with the issue of "toilet panic" during natural disasters, as water and electricity outages often render flushable toilets inoperable. Despite Japan's reputation for disaster preparedness, many people are unfamiliar with using portable toilets, leading to unsanitary conditions. Educators are now teaching elementary school students how to use portable toilets to address this issue, and the government is working to ensure temporary toilets are installed quickly after disasters. Experts recommend stockpiling portable toilets at home and in workplaces to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and maintain hygiene. The goal is to avoid the unhygienic conditions that discourage evacuees from using toilets, thus safeguarding public health.</p>

          <p>European startup founders and venture capitalists are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. They argue that Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through sustainable innovation cultures rather than overwork. Founders insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to compete globally. Additionally, younger generations are less tolerant of toxic hustle cultures and prioritize work-life balance. European startups are making a stand for sustainable work cultures.</p>
