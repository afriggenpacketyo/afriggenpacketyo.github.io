          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, marking a turning point in his struggle with addiction. Dyer, known for his role in 'EastEnders,' shared that he had been making 'a lot of bad decisions' due to the effects of fame and drug use. The letter from Dani made him reflect on the pain he had caused his family and commit to continuing his treatment at the facility in South Africa. Dyer's decision to seek help came after realizing how his addiction was affecting those around him, including his wife and children.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March. A federal judge ordered her release, citing concerns that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, as the Trump administration allegedly detained her over an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and emphasized the importance of remembering other women in immigration detention centers. Her lawyers argued that her asthma worsened during her six weeks in detention, and leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release as a victory for justice and democracy.</p>

          <p>C.C. Opanowski's testimony about her abusive relationship with Shawn Doyle helped convict him of the murder of Lori Leonard, a single mother.

Years later, Opanowski testified against Doyle, detailing the abuse she endured and helping prosecutors establish a pattern of violence. Doyle was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years to life, while Opanowski found closure and became an advocate for domestic violence awareness.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has revealed that a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication works by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking the activity of the protein‚Äôs tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signaling cell growth. The trial was conducted at 82 sites around the world, including locations in the US, China, and Japan.</p>

The company aims to double its overseas revenue to 100 billion yuan in the next three years, focusing on developing countries in Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa. Sany's revenue from overseas markets in 2024 rose 12% year-on-year to 48.51 billion yuan, representing nearly 65% of its total revenue.

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated the redevelopment of a two-kilometer expressway encircling the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, scheduled for completion by the 2040s. The Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the Tokyo Expressway, also known as the 'KK Line,' which was built on building rooftops and opened to traffic in 1966. This project, modeled after New York City's High Line, aims to create a new tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, and cafes. The KK Line was closed in April as part of a broader project to redirect portions of the Shuto Expressway.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' perfect record against former Cy Young Award winners ended with a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a strong performance by Dodgers starter Dustin May. Corbin Burnes, the Diamondbacks' pitcher, delivered seven shutout innings, effectively shutting down the Dodgers' lineup. This loss also highlighted a concerning trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records since their strong start to the season. The article notes that Burnes was particularly effective due to his command of the strike zone and use of his signature cutter.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the 'big tent' party during a town hall in Pennsylvania. Gallego argued that the party has become too exclusive, pushing away potential allies who don't align perfectly with its message. He cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone 'kicked out' of the tent, suggesting that Democrats need to be more inclusive to win elections. Gallego, who represents a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the importance of building alliances with people who may not agree on every issue.</p>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments have struggled to gain traction two years after their introduction. While over 100 companies offer mobile payment apps like PayPay as a salary payment method, only a small percentage of workers use this option. Experts suggest that the lack of perceived benefits and the limited availability of this option to full-time employees contribute to the low adoption rate. However, the percentage of cashless payments in Japan has topped 40%, indicating a slow but steady move away from cash.</p>
