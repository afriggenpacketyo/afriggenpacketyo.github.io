          <h2>Vox Article Argues Against "No Tax on Tips" Policy, Advocates for Eliminating Subminimum Wage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 14:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article in Vox critiques the "No Tax on Tips Act," arguing it primarily benefits businesses by incentivizing lower wages for tipped workers. The article suggests that the focus should instead be on eliminating the subminimum wage, which is currently $2.13 per hour, as the real issue for tipped workers is low wages, not high taxes. Data indicates that tipped workers in states without a subminimum wage have lower poverty rates. The article proposes alternative solutions like expanding the standard deduction or increasing the minimum wage to provide more meaningful support for low-wage workers.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump has not directed his administration to declassify documents related to former President Biden's health and an alleged cover-up of his mental acuity. The issue of Biden's health resurfaced after the release of audio recordings from his interview with special counsel Robert Hur. Leavitt asserted that the previous administration covered up the decline in Biden's mental and physical ability, which is now coming to light. She also addressed Trump's concerns about the Biden administration's use of an autopen.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles found that only about 20 books required further review. The initial ban included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The reversal follows a Pentagon memo that set a deadline for military services to remove books touching on diversity, race, and gender issues.
