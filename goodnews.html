          <p>High-level economic officials from China and the U.S. have initiated a new round of trade discussions in Stockholm, Sweden, marking their third such meeting. The talks, which follow previous rounds in Geneva and London, are expected to last for several days. Security around the venue was significantly increased, with Swedish authorities closing off the area and conducting explosive sweeps, indicating the high-stakes nature of the negotiations. International media have gathered as the two global economic powers attempt to navigate their complex trade relationship and seek common ground on contentious issues.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company, Boeing is beginning to show signs of recovery after years of crises. The aerospace giant has seen its aircraft production increase and deliveries reach an 18-month high, with its stock value rising over 30% this year. Despite this progress, including a more positive relationship with airline customers, the company still faces significant hurdles. These include an FAA-imposed production cap on its 737 Max jets and a potential strike at its defense unit, indicating that its path to a full turnaround remains challenging.

          <p>Following five days of deadly border clashes that killed at least 33 people and displaced tens of thousands, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The deal was brokered in Malaysia and announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who called it a vital first step toward de-escalation. The agreement was reportedly spurred by pressure from the United States, with President Trump threatening to halt trade negotiations if the fighting continued. Both nations, which are heavily dependent on exports to the U.S., moved quickly to accept the ceasefire amid the economic pressure.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal framework during his visit to Scotland. The agreement sets a 15% tariff rate for most EU imports into the U.S., avoiding a threatened 30% blanket tariff that could have sparked a transatlantic trade war. In return, the EU has reportedly agreed to purchase substantial amounts of U.S. military hardware and energy, while also increasing its investment in the American economy. The deal brings a degree of predictability for businesses, though some EU leaders have expressed reservations about the terms.</p>

          <p>British speedway champion Tai Woffinden has ridden a bike for the first time since a life-threatening crash in Poland four months ago. The 34-year-old suffered extensive injuries, including a broken back and leg, and was placed in a medically induced coma. In a video posted to social media, Woffinden was shown riding at the Olympic Stadium in Wroclaw, calling the past few months the biggest challenge of his life. His return to the track is a remarkable step in his recovery, coming just weeks after he expressed uncertainty about whether he would ever be able to ride again.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup Z.ai has announced a new open-source AI model, GLM-4.5, that it claims is even cheaper to operate than the breakthrough model from competitor DeepSeek. The company states its new model is built on "agentic" AI, which autonomously breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for more accurate completion. Z.ai reports that the model requires only eight of Nvidia's H20 chips to run, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market under U.S. export controls. This development continues the trend of Chinese firms creating powerful and cost-effective AI, challenging established players in the global market.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), are looking to capitalize on new momentum after a recall vote against 24 KMT lawmakers failed. The vote, which targeted legislators accused of obstructing key bills, was seen as a significant political miscalculation by the ruling party and a major setback for President William Lai Ching-te. The outcome has energized the informal "Blue-White" opposition alliance and strengthened their coordination. Observers believe this success positions the opposition favorably for the upcoming 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>India's cricket captain, Shubman Gill, demonstrated remarkable grit during the fourth Test against England, preventing a decisive series loss with a defiant century. Despite facing immense pressure and questions about his leadership, the 25-year-old captain anchored his team's defense after they were reduced to 0-2 early in their second innings. His performance, which has brought his series total to 722 runs with four centuries, is being hailed as a defining moment for his captaincy. By showing resilience, Gill has solidified his role as the leader for a new generation of Indian cricketers, following the retirement of several team legends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining population and the resulting economic drag, China has launched its first-ever national childcare subsidy program. The government announced it will provide an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan for every child born on or after January 1, 2025, until they reach the age of three. This policy marks a significant shift toward direct financial support for households, moving beyond previous local incentives that proved ineffective. However, some economists caution that the subsidy amount is likely too small to significantly impact the national birth rate or household consumption in the near term.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers have successfully observed tidal disruption events in which dormant black holes consume stars, an occurence previously hidden by dense cosmic dust. These events release immense radiation, but the dust in some galaxies blocks visible and X-ray light, making them undetectable. Researchers hypothesized that this radiation would heat the surrounding dust, creating an infrared signal that the JWST is uniquely equipped to detect. This new study confirms that theory, providing a new method to study these rare phenomena and proving that so-called "dormant" black holes are more active than previously thought.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive than others, often feeling deeply hurt by seemingly minor slights. Experts suggest this heightened sensitivity can stem from a combination of genetic predisposition and life experiences, such as childhood trauma or neglect. People with this trait may have more "emotional sensors," causing them to perceive the world more intensely and ruminate on perceived rejections. While this attunement can be a strength, it can also disrupt relationships if not managed with coping strategies, such as challenging negative assumptions and being more discerning about whose opinions truly matter.</p>

          <p>U.S. defense company Auterion announced it will provide Ukraine with 33,000 artificial intelligence guidance kits for its drones, funded by a $50 million Pentagon contract. These advanced kits enable manually piloted strike drones to autonomously track and engage targets up to a kilometer away. This technology is a key part of Ukraine's strategy to counter Russia's increasingly effective signal-jamming capabilities, which can disable standard GPS-guided drones. By using AI to lock onto a target's shape for the final approach, the drones can operate effectively even in electronically contested environments, significantly enhancing their battlefield resilience.</p>

          <p>To address its severe housing shortage and rising rents, Germany's government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) initiative to dramatically speed up building approvals. The proposed legislation would allow municipalities to bypass complex planning laws for new residential projects and automatically approve applications after two months unless vetoed. This move aims to cut through the dense bureaucracy that has stifled development, with the government estimating it could save around €2.5 billion annually. While the construction industry welcomes the plan, some economists and environmentalists express skepticism, arguing it may not be a sufficient short-term fix. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, Apple also showed positive signs, returning to growth in the country for the first time since late 2023 with 10.1 million iPhones shipped, securing the fifth-place spot.
