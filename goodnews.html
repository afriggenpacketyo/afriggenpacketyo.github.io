          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 08:45:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing a decades-old customs law called the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price between a foreign manufacturer and a vendor, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the U.S. retailer. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under the Trump administration's tariff regime, with companies exploring its potential cost savings. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales, carried out at arm's length by independent parties, and proof that the item was destined for the U.S., with documentation of the first sale price.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced plans to support more generous tax breaks for married people and abolish the two-child benefit limit to make it easier for people to have children. Farage emphasized that lifting the cap is intended to support lower-paid workers, not to promote a benefits culture. He also pledged to reverse government cuts that withdrew winter fuel payments from 10 million pensioners. The party aims to fund these proposals by scrapping net-zero climate measures, ending hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, and cutting diversity initiatives in the public sector.</p>

The company will invest in its supply chain and upgrade existing shops, which currently number over 1,000.

          <p>A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gaining momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence. Denmark plans to reconsider its 40-year ban on nuclear power, Spain is reportedly open to reviewing the shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany has dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power. This renewed interest is driven, at least in part, by the costs associated with renewables. Denmark plans to analyze the potential of new advanced nuclear technologies to complement solar and wind technologies.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced rapid weight gain and swelling, which led to a diagnosis of pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens. Despite numerous tests, doctors initially struggled to identify the cause of his symptoms, which included fatigue and shortness of breath. Cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition, but open-heart surgery was necessary for confirmation and treatment. The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, involved removing a thick shell of scarring from Mauceri's heart, leading to a full recovery and a return to conducting.</p>
