          <p>China is actively encouraging foreign institutions to adopt the yuan, aiming to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as confidence in the greenback diminishes. Recent initiatives include establishing a digital yuan internationalization center in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, the yuan has strengthened against it this year, and Beijing is expanding access to futures contracts for foreign investors and considering foreign currencies as collateral for yuan-settled trades. Despite these efforts, some analysts believe China's capital controls and geopolitical risks may hinder large-scale adoption of the yuan, however, these efforts are likely to have a long term impact.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that "multiple system failures" led to the Alaska Airlines incident in 2024, where a door plug flew off mid-flight. The NTSB's report blamed Boeing's safety processes and the FAA's oversight for the incident, citing missing bolts and inadequate training. The agency issued new safety recommendations to the FAA and Boeing to address the deficiencies, which both organizations have pledged to take seriously. Passengers have filed lawsuits against Boeing and Alaska Airlines, but the NTSB chair maintains confidence in the safety of Boeing airplanes, however, there are still improvements to be made.</p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past 50 years, yet recent progress in boosting vaccination rates has stalled or reversed in many places. A study in The Lancet found that measles vaccination rates dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, and several high-income countries saw declines in other key immunizations. Challenges such as conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation have hindered vaccination efforts, and changes in funding for vaccination initiatives add to the uncertainty. This has created a critical time for global vaccination efforts, but the numbers are expected to rise in the future.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London is set to display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. Initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists discovered unique features in its bones, leading to its reclassification and its full name meaning puzzling runner. This labrador-sized dinosaur, with its long tail and large feet, is the first new dinosaur to be displayed at the museum since 2014. The discovery is expected to shed light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and their transition to larger forms.</p>

While advocates claim it can reduce carbon emissions and land use, critics argue that the environmental benefits are oversold and that reducing meat consumption is a better approach. The science behind lab-grown meat involves growing cells in vats, but the process is energy-intensive, raising questions about its overall climate impact.
