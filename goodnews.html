          <p>Max Verstappen claimed victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, returning to dominant form after several races without a win. The event was marked by controversy within the McLaren team, which ordered Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The decision came after a slow pit stop, caused by a wheel gun fault, cost Norris the position he had held for most of the race. While Piastri expressed disagreement, he complied with the order, narrowing his championship lead over Norris and sparking debate about fairness in team racing strategy.</p>

          <p>After multiple sightings since 2019, police in the Czech Republic have arrested the 51-year-old driver of a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car seen on public motorways. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2/08, was tracked to a property where the driver was taken into custody while still in his racing suit and helmet. In previous encounters, police were unable to press charges because the driver's helmet obscured their identity. The owner now faces a fine for operating a vehicle on the motorway without essential features like headlights, indicators, or number plates.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has officially begun her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, a move reportedly requested by Russia due to her outspoken criticism of its war in Ukraine, though she still secured 167 of 193 votes. Baerbock's nomination by Germany's previous government drew some domestic criticism, with some arguing a more experienced diplomat was overlooked. In her new role, she will chair meetings and help prepare for the election of the next UN Secretary-General.</p>

In a recent profile, Bargatze reflected on his journey from being cut from his high school basketball team to becoming the country's highest-grossing stand-up comic. He attributes his success to a commitment to "clean comedy," which he feels is a calling that allows him to connect with a broad audience without betraying their trust.

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker completed a 12-hour, 26.4-mile ocean journey from Catalina Island to San Pedro in a kayak he grew entirely from mycelium, the root network of mushrooms. The voyage aims to highlight the potential of this biodegradable, buoyant material, known as AquaFung, as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. Shoemaker's successful crossing, the second of its kind ever, is seen by proponents as a significant step in demonstrating the viability of fungal innovation for creating sustainable materials. He plans to make his research open-source to encourage further development.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government announced it has secured a deal with the United States for the release of over 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested 475 people suspected of working illegally at the electric vehicle manufacturing site. South Korea, which had expressed "concern and regret" over the raid, plans to send a charter plane to bring the released workers home. The operation was described as the largest single-site enforcement action in the history of Homeland Security Investigations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits in infancy is one of the most critical actions new parents can take to support their child's future health and success. Known as "sleep hygiene," these practices are crucial for a baby's physical, cognitive, and emotional development, and they lay the groundwork for concentration and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, darkness, and white noise. He also stresses the importance of a flexible routine, ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped, and involving both parents in the settling process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that right-wing survivalists, or "preppers," should logically embrace solar power as the ideal energy source for societal collapse scenarios. While politically aligned with fossil fuels, prepping with diesel or gasoline requires complex, failure-prone systems for storage and replenishment. In contrast, solar panels offer a hyper-individualistic and resilient solution, providing energy for decades with minimal maintenance and no reliance on external supply chains. The author suggests that despite political rhetoric against renewables, solar energy's capacity for true self-sufficiency makes it a perfect fit for anyone concerned with long-term independence.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed reports of friction with his former NFL team, confirming he has banned New England Patriots scouts from attending UNC practices. He stated bluntly, "It’s clear I’m not welcomed in their facility, so they aren’t welcomed in ours." The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing 48-14 season-opening loss to TCU, with Belichick noting an improved level of determination from his team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a world leader in exporting and installing green technology, China is also ramping up its coal power capacity. This seemingly contradictory strategy is framed as a necessary measure to ensure grid stability while integrating record amounts of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation increasing rapidly, existing transmission infrastructure can become overloaded, leading to energy "curtailment." New coal plants are intended to act as a reliable backup power source, or "shock absorber," to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewable output fluctuates, giving the grid time to modernize.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the online marketplace Vinted, shared the story of how her personal need to downsize her wardrobe led to Lithuania's first tech unicorn. The idea originated in 2008 when, facing a move to a smaller apartment, she discussed creating a website to sell her excess clothes with a friend, Justas Janauskas. The initial site was launched in just two weeks and quickly gained popularity through word of mouth, eventually expanding internationally. Despite a near-disastrous period in 2016, the company recovered and is now a major player in the second-hand fashion market with over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>
