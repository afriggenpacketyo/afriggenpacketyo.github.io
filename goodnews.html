        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research indicates that people returned to live in Pompeii after its catastrophic destruction by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence suggests that survivors, and possibly others seeking shelter, established a precarious settlement among the ruins, which lasted until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried structures and salvaged valuable materials from the devastated city. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned, revealing a new chapter of informal reoccupation in the city's history.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, has stepped down from his position. His departure comes just before the finalization of Skydance Media's $8.4 billion acquisition of the entertainment company. Robbins, who had led Paramount Pictures since 2021, was part of a three-person leadership team that steered the company through a tumultuous period of business pressures and sale negotiations. Following the takeover, the studio will be jointly managed by longtime Skydance executives Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, signaling a significant leadership overhaul under the new ownership.
