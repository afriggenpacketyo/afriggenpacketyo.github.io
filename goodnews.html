This will be Modi's first trip to China in seven years, raising expectations for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The visit marks another step in improving relations between the two nations, which had deteriorated after a deadly border clash in 2020. A Chinese official stated that the border situation continues to stabilize and improve, reflecting a thaw in diplomatic tensions amid ongoing trade friction with the United States.</p>

          <p>Actress Alicia Silverstone recently revealed that she took a break from her acting career after her rise to fame in the 1990s because it "didn't feel as fun" anymore. During the height of her popularity following films like "Clueless," Silverstone found the intense scrutiny and judgment of her appearance to be overwhelming. She shifted her focus toward activism, writing books on health and wellness, and being a present mother to her son. Silverstone has since returned to acting with a renewed passion, balancing her career with her other commitments, and is set to star in a new series and reprise her iconic role as Cher Horowitz.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts-based company Excel Dryer successfully shifted its supply chain to be entirely sourced from American-made parts, a long-term goal that was reinforced by the implementation of tariffs on Chinese goods. The family-run business, which manufactures electric hand dryers, spent eight years searching for a domestic motor supplier to complete its transition away from reliance on Chinese components. This strategic decision not only allowed the company to avoid the financial impact of the tariffs but also fulfilled the owner's vision of supporting domestic manufacturing. The move showcases a proactive business strategy in response to global trade volatility and geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that while many investors remain confident about their portfolio performance despite market volatility, there is a notable split between newer and more seasoned participants. Newer investors are reportedly more bullish, while experienced investors are adopting a more cautious approach and showing lower risk tolerance. Financial experts advise that all investors should consistently "calibrate" the level of risk they are willing to take based on their long-term goals and changing life circumstances. Maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, potentially utilizing tools like exchange-traded funds, is recommended to navigate market ups and downs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has characterized the recent White House summit on Ukraine as a significant breakthrough, particularly welcoming President Trump's commitment to security guarantees. While publicly praising the progress and the move towards a potential meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, officials in European circles reportedly remain anxious about the process's fragility. Starmer's government appears focused on strengthening Ukraine's position for any future negotiations, viewing the U.S. involvement in security assurances as a key development. The diplomatic strategy is to fully support the U.S.-led peace plan to ensure that if it fails, the blame does not fall on European allies.</p>

          <p>The thong bathing suit, now a mainstream fashion item, was originally created as a political act of rebellion by Austrian-born gay designer Rudi Gernreich. In 1974, after Los Angeles banned public nudity on its beaches, Gernreich designed the minimalist garment for all genders to protest the new law and advocate for bodily freedom. A co-founder of one of the first LGBTQ+ rights organizations, Gernreich viewed fashion as a tool for liberation and predicted a unisex future for clothing. His work, including the controversial topless "monokini" of 1964, consistently challenged societal norms and aimed to desexualize the human body.</p>

The demand, issued under the UK's Investigatory Powers Act, had sparked a months-long transatlantic dispute involving Apple and the U.S. government, which argued the move would compromise civil liberties. In response to the UK's legal notice, Apple had previously withdrawn advanced data protection options for its new British customers.

While President Trump prioritizes a comprehensive peace deal without a prior ceasefire, European leaders, including Merz, have strongly advocated for a ceasefire as a necessary first step for credible negotiations. The discussions also raised the question of what security guarantees for Ukraine would entail, with possibilities ranging from NATO-like mutual defense commitments to the deployment of peacekeeping troops.

          <p>Matcha, the finely ground green tea powder, is experiencing a major resurgence in popularity, nearly a decade after its first wave as a niche health trend. This new boom is largely fueled by social media platforms like TikTok, where the drink's vibrant green color and the ritual of its preparation are highly photogenic. Unlike the previous trend, this wave is characterized by extreme customization, with consumers often adding significant amounts of milk, sugar, and flavored syrups to create sweet lattes, diluting the tea's natural taste.

          <p>Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1960s thriller "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma. The movie's plot centers on a kidnapping where the chauffeur's son is taken by mistake instead of the executive's own child. The review notes that while the film starts with a somewhat chaotic and choppy style, it finds its footing with a compelling ransom-exchange sequence and strong performances. The article suggests the film serves as a self-aware satire, exploring themes of creative integrity, class disparity, and what happens when a cultural tastemaker risks losing his edge.</p>

While still rare, organizations that support prospective parents have seen a significant increase in interest from single men in recent years, a trend possibly accelerated by the pandemic-induced re-evaluation of life priorities. This demographic shift reflects loosening social norms around family structures and a growing emphasis on the importance of fatherhood for men's sense of purpose.
