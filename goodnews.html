          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an agreed-upon line, calling it the first phase of a peace deal. Two regional sources confirmed an agreement in principle, pending procedural details, with hostage release potentially starting on Monday. The deal requires Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line in Gaza, followed by Hamas releasing hostages within 72 hours. Hamas praised mediators and called on Trump to ensure Israel complies with the agreement, while Netanyahu said it was a big day for Israel. This agreement follows Trump's unveiling of a 20-point peace plan and indirect negotiations in Egypt. The plan is welcomed by all sides as a starting point.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares rose 10% after announcing the acquisition of ABB's robotics division for $5.4 billion, furthering SoftBank's expansion into AI. Masayoshi Son envisions merging Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics, while ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. SoftBank also owns chip designer Arm and has a stake in OpenAI, solidifying its position in the AI sector. Additionally, SoftBank-owned Graphcore plans a $1.3 billion investment in India, including a new research hub, coinciding with the British Prime Minister's visit. These strategic moves reflect SoftBank's focus on capitalizing on the potential AI boom.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the initial steps of a U.S.-backed peace framework in Gaza, but some of the most difficult points, such as the governance of Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas fighters, will still need to be negotiated down the line. The agreement focuses on the partial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. This is not the first time the U.S. has brokered a multi-part agreement aimed at ending the conflict that includes the release of hostages in an initial phase. A previous three-phase agreement brokered at the beginning of the year fell apart after the release of more than 30 hostages.</p>

          <p>A Disneyland visitor died at an Orange County hospital after requiring medical attention on the Haunted Mansion ride. The woman, in her 60s, was found unresponsive after the ride, and Disneyland security performed CPR until paramedics arrived. The Orange County Sheriff-Coroner is investigating the cause of death, with no indication of any operating issue with the attraction. Theme park deaths are rare, and experts note the Haunted Mansion is a slow-moving ride unlikely to cause medical incidents. Theme parks, particularly Disney and Universal, undergo frequent inspections to ensure safety.</p>

The plan proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a technocratic committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states. If Hamas does not accept the offer, Netanyahu said Israel would finish the job itself. The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree, with Israeli forces withdrawing to an agreed-upon line and a full aid package being sent to Gaza. The plan's success hinges on Hamas's response and cooperation from international partners.</p>

          <p>At the Supreme Court, justices from both sides expressed skepticism toward both parties in a case challenging Illinois voting regulations. The case involves a suit by Rep. Michael Bost, who is challenging the constitutionality of an Illinois regulation that allows ballots mailed in by Election Day to be counted for up to 14 days after polls close. The lower courts ruled against Bost because he won and failed to show individual harm. The justices questioned whether candidates with no real chance of winning should automatically be able to sue and challenged the arguments presented by both sides.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a routine yearly checkup, his second since April. The visit comes after Trump's diagnosis with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition causing swelling in his legs. The White House stated Trump is considering a trip to the Middle East shortly after the consultation. Trump's physician addressed concerns about bruising on the president's hand, attributing it to irritation from frequent handshaking and aspirin use. Trump has been cagey about his health, and rumors reached a fever pitch when he faded from public view over the summer.</p>

President Trump announced that both sides have signed off on the first phase of a peace plan, which includes the release of all hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. The deal calls for Hamas to disarm and give up a future role in governing Gaza. Israel is expected to keep some troops in Gaza for now but would eventually remove them as the ceasefire solidifies.

Sana was awarded a scholarship at Durham University, but weeks of uncertainty followed before she was allowed to come to the UK. Sana set up her own makeshift school in a roof-less building at her home in Deir al-Balah, teaching English and maths to displaced children. In all, 58 students from Gaza have now arrived to take up scholarships at more than 30 universities around the UK, but Sana says she is struggling to concentrate and can't eat or sleep properly.</p>
