          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the president for the upcoming UN climate talks, discusses the difficulty of maintaining focus on climate change amid global conflicts and political shifts. He emphasizes that despite wars and trade disputes, the threat of climate change is progressively worsening, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events worldwide. The article highlights the pressure on Brazil to drive progress on transitioning from fossil fuels, even as the country's own oil exploration policies face scrutiny. Correa do Lago remains pragmatic, stressing the need for a new economic model that integrates climate action to achieve global goals.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, with a nearly 61% year-on-year increase fueled by sustained demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company's revenue, primarily driven by its high-performance computing division which serves clients like Nvidia and Apple, also surpassed market expectations. TSMC projects continued strong growth into 2025, with revenue expected to rise by about 30%. However, the company acknowledges potential risks from potential U.S. tariff policies and existing export controls affecting its business with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars reported a second-quarter operating profit that beat analyst forecasts, causing its shares to rise over 10%. Despite a significant year-on-year decline in profit and revenue, the results were better than anticipated in a challenging automotive market. The company, which is highly exposed to U.S. tariffs, is strategically shifting its production, planning to build its popular XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant. This move aims to utilize the U.S. factory more effectively and navigate the complex tariff landscape while reaffirming its commitment to the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a €2 trillion budget for the 2028-2034 period, featuring a significant fivefold increase in defense and space investment. The proposed European Competitiveness Fund would allocate €131 billion to these sectors, reflecting a broader European trend of rearmament in response to geopolitical instability. The budget framework, which amounts to 1.26% of the EU's GNI, also allocates 35% to climate projects and includes €100 billion in support for Ukraine. The proposal requires unanimous approval from member states, with some, like the Netherlands, already deeming the overall budget too high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated his ambition to sell more advanced semiconductors to China, following the recent reversal of a ban on its H20 AI chip. Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology evolves, it is sensible for the chips available to the Chinese market to improve over time as well. Nvidia has been navigating complex U.S. export controls that have restricted its access to the world's second-largest economy, forcing it to develop compliant, less-advanced chips. The comments come as the U.S. government appears to favor a strategy of keeping China reliant on American technology. (not investment advice)</p>
