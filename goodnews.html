          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has reignited discussions about his mental and physical fitness for office. The recording captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, providing context for Hur's description of him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." This has prompted fresh recriminations among Democrats and raised concerns about Biden's ability to lead, particularly after a disastrous debate performance and subsequent withdrawal from the presidential race. The article details specific instances from the recording where Biden struggles to recall key dates, including the death of his son Beau.</p>

Given Irenic's history, a sale is deemed more likely, potentially to a strategic acquirer or private equity firm.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Provisional figures from the CDC indicate that drug overdose deaths in the US have declined significantly in 2024, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths compared to 2023. This represents the steepest single-year decline in overdose deaths in 45 years, bringing the numbers back to pre-pandemic levels. The decline is widespread across 45 states and is largely attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and tougher enforcement on fentanyl. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will achieve its target of having women occupy 30% of top corporate roles by 2030. A survey of 41 senior women, including CEOs and auditors, revealed that 73% believe a shift in top management's views is needed, while 54% cited the need to change company culture. The respondents attributed the imbalance to traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues.

While some experts question the exclusion of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine from the process, others emphasize the importance of balancing diverse interests within Trump's base.

The game was the start of a Subway Series between the first-place Mets and Yankees, with fans making alterations to old Soto jerseys to reflect their current allegiance. The Yankees ultimately won the game 6-2, but Soto had a solid performance with three walks, a stolen base, and a run scored.</p>

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the possible scheme as "free movement through the back door," while Starmer insists it would not amount to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement.
