          <p>A tax preparer in Bakersfield, California, has admitted his involvement in a significant tax fraud operation. He pleaded guilty to assisting an undocumented Mexican national in filing hundreds of fraudulent income tax returns using stolen identities and fictitious businesses. The scheme attempted to claim $25 million in refunds from the IRS, of which $2.3 million was successfully paid out before the fraud was uncovered. The tax preparer, who received thousands in fees for his services, now faces a potential 10-year prison sentence and a substantial fine.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in Victorville, California, after allegedly planting a macabre teddy bear and falsely reporting it to authorities as being made of human skin. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department responded to a call at a gas station and found the object, but the coroner quickly determined it was not made of human remains. The artist who created the prop confirmed she had sold it to a customer in the area but was unaware of the buyer's intentions. The suspect was arrested for filing a false report and wasting valuable emergency resources on the prank.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has successfully recovered an assault rifle and five magazines that were lost after potentially falling from a squad car. The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken. A resident in Lennox discovered the hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the South L.A. sheriff's station. Officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's honesty and responsible actions, which prevented the high-powered weapon from remaining on the streets.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could resolve long-standing issues with the country's aircraft engines. The method involves a novel way to rapidly cool superalloy turbine discs, a critical component that must withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. Improving the quality and durability of these discs is essential for enhancing engine power, efficiency, and lifespan. This technological advancement is considered crucial for China's development of next-generation fighter jets, an area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court deny the appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's legal team argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not grant her immunity from prosecution in New York. An attorney for Epstein's victims stated that Maxwell deserves no protection and should remain imprisoned for her horrific crimes.</p>

The grueling 135-mile course starts in Death Valley, 282 feet below sea level, and ascends to the trailhead of Mt. Whitney. Becker finished the race with three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after falling just short of the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. His remarkable achievement demonstrates incredible endurance and serves as an inspiration, proving that age is not a barrier to extraordinary athletic feats.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding submerged their land, farmers in the Midwest are working to recover and rebuild. One South Dakota family, the Obergs, lost their lifelong home and had to sell a portion of their farmland to finance a new house built on higher ground. The floods, which saw a year's worth of rain in two months, were followed by a severe drought, highlighting the "whiplash weather" challenges posed by climate change. Despite the immense financial and emotional toll, farmers are demonstrating resilience, replanting crops, and expressing cautious optimism for the future as they adapt to the new climate realities.</p>

They noted that any new expenses would likely only slightly increase costs for one-time account verifications and would not be a "business model-breaking" event.
