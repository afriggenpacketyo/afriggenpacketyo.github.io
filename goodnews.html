        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these changes will affect over 800,000 workers, with a significant portion being women and minority workers. The hikes come as the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009, prompting local governments to enact their own increases. The new hourly wages will be $13.00 in Alaska, $17.95 in Washington D.C., and $15.05 in Oregon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Ric Edelman Advocates for Significant Crypto Allocation in Portfolios</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 17:01:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman now recommends that investors consider allocating 10% to 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous 1% suggestion. He attributes this shift to the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset class, citing the resolution of earlier uncertainties about government bans and institutional adoption. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating assets with higher growth potential. He believes crypto offers portfolio diversification and the potential for returns that are unlikely to be matched by other asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the signing of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, aiming to end a conflict that has lasted nearly three decades. The deal seeks to halt the violence in eastern DRC, where a militia allegedly supported by Rwanda has caused a severe humanitarian crisis. During the announcement, Trump stated the U.S. would enforce the agreement with significant pressure, including potential financial penalties, to ensure peace is maintained. The agreement also reportedly grants the United States access to the DRC's substantial mineral deposits, including gold, copper, and lithium.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record high of 6,173, marking a significant rebound since a sharp drop in April following the announcement of new tariffs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also reached a record close, driven by investor optimism over easing global trade tensions and forecasts of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This market rally reflects a stunning turnaround, with analysts pointing to calmer rhetoric from the White House on trade and resilient corporate profits.

          <p>Brentford has rejected a second, improved bid from Manchester United for forward Bryan Mbeumo, this time worth up to ¬£62.5 million. The offer consisted of a ¬£55 million base fee plus ¬£7.5 million in potential add-ons. This follows an earlier rejected bid of ¬£45 million plus add-ons for the 25-year-old Cameroon international. Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for Brentford last season, is also reportedly attracting interest from other clubs, including Tottenham. Brentford is believed to be seeking a higher guaranteed fee before agreeing to sell the player, who has one year remaining on his contract.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its food products by the end of 2027. The company stated that a majority of its items, such as Uncrustables sandwiches, are already free from synthetic dyes, but some products like sugar-free jams and certain Hostess snacks still contain them. This move follows similar pledges from other major food corporations, including Nestle, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills. The decision aligns with increased federal scrutiny of artificial food additives, highlighted by the recent U.S. ban on the dye Red 3 due to potential health risks.</p>

          <p>California legislators have voted to more than double the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and industry workers who have been lobbying for increased incentives to combat production being lured to other states and countries. Proponents argued the expansion is a crucial lifeline needed to keep the industry in California and bring jobs back to the state. A related bill is also being considered to broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the potential tax offset for productions.</p>

          <p>The British government has softened its travel advice for Israel, now recommending against all but essential travel to most of the country following a recent ceasefire. This update comes as the final UK-organized evacuation flight for British nationals is scheduled to depart from Tel Aviv, with demand decreasing as commercial flights resume. The Foreign Office had previously advised against all travel to the region after missile exchanges began between Israel and Iran. While the situation is described as fragile, the eased guidance reflects the de-escalation of the 12-day conflict that ended with a U.S. and Qatar-brokered ceasefire.</p>

Gallo, who is intersex and the child of Salvadoran immigrants, developed the story from their own experiences and a desire to explore themes of masculinity and self-acceptance. The film is a significant milestone, being one of the first to center an intersex narrative and has been praised for bringing visibility to a community often ignored in media and legislation.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, surging over 43% for the month. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory news like the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and successful product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, pointing to its strong financial connection with the recently listed and high-performing Circle Internet Group.
