The session will focus on improving the state's emergency preparedness and future flood response capabilities.

          <p>Analysts from China International Capital Corporation are urging the Chinese government to implement top-down macroeconomic policies to combat "neijuan," or involution. This term describes a cycle of inefficient, excessive competition where companies invest more resources for diminishing returns. The research note suggests that the most effective way to break this cycle is to expand market demand by boosting domestic consumption, thereby creating an "incremental cake" for businesses. The analysts also emphasized that companies must focus on research and development to offer differentiated products, fostering a more positive, demand-driven economic environment instead of a zero-sum game.</p>

          <p>High-net-worth individuals are increasingly turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, driven by geopolitical tensions and a desire to diversify from the U.S. dollar. Wealthy investors are utilizing various methods, from purchasing fractional ownership of unallocated gold bars held in bank vaults to stashing physical bullions in highly secure locations like former Swiss military bunkers. According to an HSBC survey, gold allocations among affluent investors have more than doubled to 11% this year. Bankers report a notable rise in interest from U.S. clients, who find gold a more straightforward investment compared to navigating foreign currencies and securities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an innovative environmental project off the Belgian coast, a century-old shipwreck is being used to reintroduce the native flat oyster to the North Sea. Scientists have deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to establish a new reef that will boost biodiversity and help purify the water. The species has largely vanished from the region due to overfishing and disease. The shipwreck was chosen because it is a protected heritage site where disruptive activities like fishing are banned, providing a safe haven for the oysters to grow, reproduce, and support a healthier marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is contemplating an increase to the bonus it pays staff for intercepting passengers with oversized luggage at the gate. The budget airline currently offers about €1.50 per bag to incentivize enforcement of its baggage rules, which CEO Michael O'Leary calls a necessary measure to prevent boarding delays. The move comes as the airline reported a significant jump in quarterly profits, more than doubling to €820 million, thanks to a strong Easter season and a 21% rise in average fares. The company maintains that over 99% of passengers comply with the rules. (not investment advice)</p>

This approach not only improves the adoption prospects for the dogs in the program by helping them socialize and build confidence, but it also frees up critical kennel space, benefiting all animals in the overcrowded shelter system.
