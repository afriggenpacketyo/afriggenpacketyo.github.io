          <h2>Fentanyl Crisis Expected to Re-emerge as Key Topic in U.S.-China Trade Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 18:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts anticipate that the fentanyl crisis will become a significant item on the U.S.-China trade agenda after a prolonged absence from bilateral discussions. The issue is viewed as a potential "third stage" in negotiations, leveraging a critical U.S. national security and public health concern to potentially ease broader economic tensions. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Addressing its trafficking could foster greater cooperation and potentially relax trade frictions between the two global powers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:47:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's rare earth exports to China surged threefold, coinciding with a record high in China's overall imports of these strategic minerals. This shift suggests that ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be rerouting global supply chains through other economies. While Brazil's total exports to China decreased, the significant increase in rare earth compounds highlights China's strategy to diversify its access to critical resources. This trend is seen as a direct ripple effect of the hardening trade barriers between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Esteemed cinematographer Darius Khondji, known for his work on films like "Seven" and "Uncut Gems," reflects on his artistic philosophy of fully embracing a director's vision. In a recent interview, he describes his process as impressionistic and feeling-based, adapting his style like a chameleon for each new project. Khondji, who has collaborated with renowned directors from David Fincher to Ari Aster, emphasizes that his creative choices are always subordinated to the emotional needs of the story. His work on "Eddington" marks his latest collaboration, continuing a career defined by visual poetry and a deep understanding of the human soul.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House has passed the Genius Act, the first major legislation to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to maintain a stable value. The bill, which now heads to the president, establishes a legal framework and consumer protections for the $250 billion market, allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue this will enable faster, lower-cost payments, while critics worry about risks like de-pegging and market volatility. The legislation is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to support the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's emergence as a dependable All-Star this season is being credited to his transformative experience in last year's playoffs. After a difficult rookie season and a poor start in the National League Division Series, he delivered a crucial, five-inning scoreless performance in the decisive Game 5 against the San Diego Padres. That high-pressure success became a major source of confidence, propelling him through the rest of the postseason and into his dominant 2025 campaign. His growth has made him a cornerstone of the Dodgers' rotation.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis, this article explains chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common condition in older adults where leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart. This can cause blood to pool, leading to symptoms like swelling in the ankles and feet, achy legs, and varicose veins. While generally benign, doctors must first rule out more serious causes like heart disease or blood clots using tests like ultrasound exams. Treatment for CVI often includes wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.</p>

          <p>To celebrate its 70th anniversary, Disneyland has debuted a new attraction, "Walt Disney — A Magical Life," featuring the first-ever audio-animatronic figure of the company's founder. The highly realistic robot, which portrays Disney in 1963, aims to reconnect audiences with the man behind the global brand. While the creation has been praised for its fluid, subtle movements, it has also sparked debate, with some, including Disney's granddaughter, questioning whether he would have wanted to be immortalized as a robot. The show combines the animatronic's speech with a documentary-style film about Disney's vision.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, the first major standalone crypto legislation in the U.S., marking a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry and the Trump administration.

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. A comprehensive medical examination, including vascular studies, confirmed the condition, which is common in individuals over 70 and involves inadequate blood flow in leg veins. Officials stated there was no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function. The announcement also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the 2017 fraud conviction of Mark Johnson, a former HSBC foreign exchange trader, after a nine-year legal battle. Johnson was convicted of wire fraud for allegedly 'front-running' a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client, a practice he and industry groups maintained was a standard risk-management technique known as 'pre-hedging.' After serving time in both U.S. and UK prisons, Johnson was granted a full acquittal following a 2023 court decision that overturned the specific law used in his prosecution. His lawyer stated that the case never should have been brought.</p>

          <p>The British government plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all UK elections, a key promise of the ruling Labour Party. The reform, part of a broader effort to modernize democracy, would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers. Proponents argue that since 16-year-olds can work, pay taxes, and join the army, they should have a say in government. While the move is likely to pass in the UK, similar efforts in the U.S. face significant opposition, though some American cities have successfully lowered the voting age for local elections.</p>
