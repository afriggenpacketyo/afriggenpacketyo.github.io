          <p>Unpaid medical debt can negatively affect credit scores, but recent changes in credit reporting rules offer some relief. Paid medical collections no longer appear on credit reports, and there is a one-year waiting period before medical bills sent to collections are added to credit reports. Medical collections under $500 are excluded entirely from credit reports, providing some protection for smaller debts. Individuals struggling with medical debt have options such as reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance, and considering debt relief programs. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite its success, changing media habits mean that "Ordinary" has not become a ubiquitous phenomenon in the same way as past long-running hits.
