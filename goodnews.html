          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 roles as part of a comprehensive turnaround strategy led by CEO Joshua Schulman, with the goal of saving ¬£60 million by 2027. These cost-cutting measures, which follow a previous ¬£40 million reduction, will impact office-based positions, stores, and the Castleford factory, representing about 20% of the company's total headcount. Despite sales declines across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Burberry shares rose 8.5% after the announcement, and Schulman remains optimistic about the brand's future. The company also cited geopolitical tensions and potential tariff impacts as key downside risks.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading but ultimately rose following the announcement of a 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) share buyback and better-than-expected operating income for the last quarter of the fiscal year. Despite beating analyst estimates with an operating income of 203.6 billion yen, this figure still represents an 11% decrease compared to the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, which will be classified as a discontinued operation in the company's accounting, and the company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and rhetoric against renewable energy, are creating uncertainty and potentially slowing the growth of the clean energy sector in the United States. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), tariffs on imports, particularly from Southeast Asia, could raise costs for renewable energy projects and impact consumers. While the clean energy sector has experienced significant growth in recent years, Trump's focus on fossil fuels and attempts to halt green energy funding pose challenges. Experts believe that the sector will continue to grow, but at a slower pace, and the US risks isolating itself in the global shift towards cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has outlined plans to combat a 'crisis of trust' in UK society by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie argues that the BBC can play a key role in strengthening democracy, boosting education and economic growth, and improving digital access. He also proposed a national plan to switch off traditional broadcast transmissions in the 2030s and transition to internet-only delivery of programs, potentially launching a streaming media device with simplified user interface for those not yet benefiting from IP services. The BBC aims to become a global leader in trusted information and support a cohesive, democratic society.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and adoption by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, to help the company recover from financial losses due to the Los Angeles-area wildfires. This increase, which is lower than the initially requested 21.8%, will provide State Farm with a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company. The decision has sparked controversy, with fire survivors and State Senator Sasha Ren√©e P√©rez criticizing the approval and requesting an investigation into alleged payment delays. In response, Lara assured residents that he is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly and that the decision was made to protect all customers and the insurance market.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as ultra-rich individuals seek personalized wealth management services, but they face challenges in finding qualified money managers. The industry is expected to expand significantly by 2030, leading to a potential shortage of advisors, as family offices compete with banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for talent. Trust is a critical factor in hiring, often outweighing other qualifications, and families seek candidates who can fulfill multiple roles, making it difficult to find the perfect fit. Compensation packages are increasing to attract and retain talent, but younger employees are often reluctant to work in family offices due to the lack of a clear corporate structure and perceived career risks.</p>

          <p>New climate data from oyster fossils challenges the assumption that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting icy interludes in the dinosaurs' greenhouse world. The research indicates seasonal temperature changes in the southern hemisphere and the presence of polar ice during that era. Scientists say that applying these findings to the present day provides insight into climate change, including the potential for ice-free polar regions. The study highlights the transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with only seasonal ice, shifting from a predominantly white winter planet to a blue one.</p>

Despite this decline, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has significantly reduced the population of egg-laying hens. The April average price was still 79% higher than the same month a year ago, prompting efforts from the Trump administration to invest in biosecurity measures and increase egg imports from other countries.

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, both on themselves and others. The chimps were filmed using plants for first aid in the Budongo Forest, building on previous discoveries that they seek out and eat certain plants for self-medication. Researchers compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use 'forest first aid'. The study adds to evidence that primates use natural medicines for health, with some chimps even helping others, showcasing potential empathy.</p>

          <h2>Canadian Prime Minister Expresses Disapproval of UK State Visit for Trump</h2>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has expressed that Canadians were not impressed by the UK government's decision to offer President Trump a second state visit, particularly given concerns about Canadian sovereignty. Carney's remarks follow Trump's threat to make Canada the 51st state of the US, and he has invited King Charles to open Canada's parliament as a clear message of sovereignty. While tensions between the US and Canada have since abated, Carney remains cautious and is planning for various potential scenarios, including a no-deal situation and trouble in the security relationship.</p>

          <p>As President Trump cuts funding for American research institutions and restricts what can be studied, countries around the world are actively recruiting disenchanted American researchers. The EU, France, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Ireland, Belgium, South Korea and China have announced plans to attract scientists with funding, relocation assistance, and promises of academic freedom. The programs, while often offering lower salaries, highlight the growing recognition of the value of scientific expertise and the opportunity to capitalize on the shifting landscape of research funding and political priorities in the United States.</p>
