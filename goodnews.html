          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at her home in New York City at the age of 87, reportedly from natural causes. Swit's portrayal of Houlihan, a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce, spanned 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983. As the show evolved, Swit aimed to portray Houlihan as a complex character undergoing constant development, even if it meant sacrificing some jokes. Swit won two Emmys and was nominated for four Golden Globes for her performances on "M*A*S*H."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, following his announcement of a "partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details on the structure of the deal, especially after President Biden initially blocked the acquisition on national security grounds. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick stated that the U.S. government will retain a "golden share," ensuring U.S. government approval over key board members and production levels. The "golden share" likely wouldn't take the form of an equity stake by the U.S. government, but rather a contractual right for the U.S. government to veto certain actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law that restricts cellphone use for public school students throughout the state. The law builds upon Youngkin's previous executive order and aims to reduce distractions and improve academic performance, mental health, and interpersonal relationships among students. The legislation mandates school boards to develop policies limiting cellphone use during the school day, with exceptions for students with specific educational or health needs. Research suggests that cellphone use in classrooms can negatively impact students' grades and social skills.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) identified $175 billion in potential savings, more significant fiscal changes are needed to address America's soaring deficits and national debt. The author suggests that the Trump administration and Congress should enact the DOGE cuts into law and address entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. The article highlights the need for both parties to come together to put these programs on a path to sustainability.</p>

          <p>The remains of 19 Black New Orleanians, whose skulls were dismembered and shipped to Germany in the late 1800s for racist research, are being returned to New Orleans for memorialization and burial. The research, which sought to prove the debunked theory that Black people's brains were smaller, involved skulls taken from deceased individuals at New Orleans' charity hospital. The skulls will be laid to rest after a memorial and jazz funeral, with efforts made to honor the deceased and their stories.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses the stock market's resilience despite President Trump's erratic trade policies and tariff announcements. Investors are focusing on positive signs in the U.S. economy, such as job growth and slowing inflation, rather than trade-related turmoil. Cramer notes that companies are adapting to the tariff situation by making adjustments to their supply chains. He suggests the president should recognize and praise the efforts of companies like Costco and Apple to mitigate tariff impacts and invest in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
