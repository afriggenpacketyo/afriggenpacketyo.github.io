        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been detected so far back in cosmic time. Researchers, using the LOFAR radio telescope, believe these energetic particles have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe. The finding provides a new window into how galaxies evolve, driven by phenomena like supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions in the early universe.</p>

Ohtani pitched two sharp innings, throwing 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and recording a 101.7-mph fastball, the fastest of his MLB career. Despite his strong performance, the Dodgers' bulk relief pitcher struggled, and the offense was unable to capitalize on opportunities against Royals starter Seth Lugo. While the loss snapped a five-game winning streak, Ohtani's effective outing was an encouraging sign in his recovery from a second Tommy John surgery.</p>

          <p>According to computer scientist Harry Shum, a former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, despite a significant gap in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that while the U.S. remains far ahead in advanced chip production, Chinese firms are making major strides in algorithm engineering. He highlighted the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power. This suggests China is finding innovative ways to overcome hardware limitations in the global AI race.</p>

The lawsuit was filed by the five men, who were wrongfully convicted in a 1989 sexual assault case, over statements Trump made during a 2024 presidential debate.

This indicates that upon marriage, husbands likely relocated to their wife's household. The findings also revealed a clear pattern of preferential treatment, with five times more grave goods buried with females than with males, supporting the theory of a society where maternal lineage and female status were key.</p>
