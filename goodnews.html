          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. Crews have installed thousands of tons of boulders and cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the project's total cost at around $300 million. The OCTA acknowledged the recurring disruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs, highlighting the need for ongoing maintenance and reinforcement efforts to ensure safe and reliable transportation.</p>

          <p>Cambridge Associates anticipates a potential surge in global investment in Chinese stocks, as investors reassess their US-heavy portfolios and seek undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. Despite aggressive tariffs, Chinese equities have outperformed, and valuations remain attractive compared to expensive US stocks. With compelling valuations and falling interest rates in the region, diversifying away from US equities is becoming increasingly appealing. Institutional portfolios are starting to tilt away from US markets, with Asia benefiting from both relative value and early signs of policy support. (not investment advice)</p>
