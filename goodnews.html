          <p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner and worship leader Sean Feucht co-hosted a faith-based disaster recovery event on the National Mall, marking a significant shift in federal engagement with Christian organizations. Turner emphasized that "faith is back in our government" under President Trump, highlighting the crucial role faith-based groups play in post-disaster recovery. The event, part of HUD's Innovative Housing Showcase, celebrated these organizations as vital partners, a notable change for Feucht, who previously faced opposition for his worship gatherings. Despite strong wind and rain, hundreds attended the "historic" event, showcasing a federally recognized platform for faith leaders.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka defeated Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to claim her second consecutive US Open title, marking her fourth Grand Slam trophy overall. The Belarusian player, who had lost two major finals earlier in the year, demonstrated improved emotional composure to secure the victory. Sabalenka's tactical approach involved absorbing Anisimova's powerful shots and forcing errors, ultimately dominating the tie-break after failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set. This win signifies a significant emotional breakthrough for Sabalenka, who learned from her previous defeats to maintain calm under pressure.</p>

          <p>Schools across the United States are increasingly implementing Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, aiming to reduce distractions and improve student engagement. The system, which requires students to lock their phones in pouches that can only be unlocked at designated stations, is now used by at least 2.5 million students in 35 states. Educators and parents report positive changes, including more in-person interaction and a greater focus on learning, despite initial skepticism and attempts by some students to bypass the system. The initiative seeks to foster a culture where students can experience life outside a "fully digital realm" and engage more directly with their education and peers.</p>

The article highlights an unexpected display of camaraderie between Xi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling a potential realignment of influence. The SCO, which includes 10 member states, focuses on combating terrorism and integrating economic initiatives like China's Belt and Road.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of car enthusiasts gathered in Kansas City, Missouri, for the first Annual Cody Allen Memorial Car Show, honoring late Independence Police Officer Cody Allen, who was killed in the line of duty last year. The event brought together diverse car communities, including hot rods, low riders, and supercars, to show support for law enforcement. Initially intended to benefit Allen's family, the proceeds were instead donated to Answering the Call, a nonprofit assisting first responders in crisis. The show emphasized community, brotherhood, and sisterhood among car lovers, reflecting on Officer Allen's impact and the daily sacrifices of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, co-founded Sisters in Service to provide support and recognition for female military veterans, particularly those working in healthcare. The community interest company, with 160 members, addresses the unique challenges women face due to misconceptions about their front-line roles in modern conflicts. Dr. Bennett emphasizes that many people hold an "outdated idea" that only men deploy to the front line, leading to isolation for female veterans who often avoid traditional support spaces. The group fosters a "cathartic" environment for women to connect, share experiences, and overcome the mental load of their service and transition to civilian life.</p>

          <p>The European Union's new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), will be gradually introduced this autumn, starting October 12, to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens. The system, covering 29 Schengen Area countries, will replace manual passport stamping by requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at kiosks upon their first use. Concerns have been raised about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy hubs like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The EES registration will be valid for three years, aiming for smoother travel once fully implemented by April 2026.</p>
