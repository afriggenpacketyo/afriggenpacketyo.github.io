          <p>IMAX is poised for a record-breaking $1.2 billion year, capitalizing on the post-pandemic demand for premium cinematic experiences. The company's market share has surged, with several major films earning over 20% of their domestic box office from IMAX screenings, despite its screens making up less than 1% of the global total. This success is driven by partnerships with studios for films shot with IMAX cameras, like "Oppenheimer" and "Dune," which enhances the viewing experience and attracts larger audiences. With a strong slate of upcoming blockbusters and plans to build 500 new theaters, the company anticipates continued significant growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:37:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally and triggered over $650 million in short liquidations. The market's momentum is also attributed to expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential crypto-friendly legislation. This rally has positively impacted crypto-related stocks, with the digital asset continuing its strong performance for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, EU Commissioner Marta Kos highlighted that the European Union's enlargement is fundamentally about ensuring peace, a shift from the previous focus on economic prosperity. She noted the remarkable progress of Ukraine, which is advancing with reforms and accession negotiations despite the ongoing war, and the EU's efforts to counter Russian disinformation in Moldova. Kos affirmed that while geopolitical factors are important, the merit-based principle remains the cornerstone of the accession process, ensuring new members are prepared for the economic market and can uphold democratic values. The interview also touched upon the complexities of Serbia's candidacy and navigating internal EU disagreements.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Patriot air defense systems will be sent to Ukraine through a new arrangement with NATO. Under the deal, the U.S. will provide the weapons to NATO, which will then distribute them to Ukraine and reimburse the full cost. The announcement follows a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for ten Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. The Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's layered air defense, protecting cities and critical infrastructure from relentless Russian bombardments.</p>

          <h2>Texas Implements Major Overhaul of Anti-Abortion Program After Investigation Reveals Lack of Oversight</h2>

          <p>Following an investigation that exposed minimal oversight and questionable spending, Texas is overhauling its "Thriving Texas Families" program, which promotes alternatives to abortion. The program, with a budget growing to $100 million annually, had allowed providers to bill the state at flat rates without documenting actual costs, leading some to amass large assets or finance real estate. Under the new rules, organizations must document all expenses and will only be reimbursed for actual costs tied to state-approved services, a change intended to increase accountability. This shift brings the program more in line with standard government contracting, though critics question if it addresses broader gaps in the state's social safety net.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is currently testing "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer from the startup Cognition, with plans to integrate it into its workforce of 12,000 human developers. This move marks a significant milestone for the adoption of agentic AI on Wall Street, which can execute complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, envisions a "hybrid workforce" where AI handles tedious tasks, potentially boosting productivity by three to four times compared to previous AI tools. While this signals a major shift in corporate technology, it also raises concerns about the future of human jobs in the financial sector.</p>

This move marks the electric vehicle maker's first official foray into the country, where it will likely begin direct sales to customers. The launch follows extensive planning and discussions between CEO Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tesla will face challenges, including a 70% import duty on EVs and competition from established players like BYD and Tata Motors, as it will initially import cars rather than manufacturing them locally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new robotic system designed for cotton topping has been debuted in Xinjiang, China, promising to automate a crucial and labor-intensive agricultural process. The robot uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and vaporize the plant's terminal bud with a laser, which redirects nutrients to boost boll formation and yield. Developed by Xinjiang University, the machine reportedly achieves 98.9% accuracy in bud detection with minimal plant damage. This innovation represents a significant step toward fully automated cotton production, though it is still in the pilot testing phase and not yet commercially available.</p>

A member of the public discovered her on a forest trail in a "fragile" state but without serious injuries. Wilga was last seen on June 29 in the small town of Beacon, Western Australia, and her abandoned van was spotted by a police helicopter on Thursday in the vast Karroun Hill Nature Reserve. Police believe her van became stuck in mud, and she subsequently became lost while trying to find help in the hostile and challenging environment.</p>

The loan is scheduled for September 2026, when it will be displayed at the British Museum while its home museum in Bayeux undergoes renovations. In exchange, the British Museum will loan several of its own treasures to museums in Normandy, marking a significant moment of cultural exchange between France and the UK.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever seen, potentially predating our own solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object detected visiting our solar system from interstellar space. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk," an area of ancient stars, which would explain its age and composition of water ice. As Atlas approaches the sun later this year, it is expected to heat up and create a glowing tail, potentially making it visible from Earth with amateur telescopes.</p>

In a statement, the group said the move was a voluntary step of goodwill intended to bring about peace and freedom. The disarmament follows Ocalan's urging for the PKK to formally disband and renounce armed conflict, a process he hopes will be overseen by a commission in the Turkish parliament.</p>
