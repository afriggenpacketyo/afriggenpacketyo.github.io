          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary's exhibit, "Sahy Rano," raises awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a disease affecting millions of women and girls, mainly in Africa. The waterborne infection, spread by parasitic worms, leads to infertility and other health issues, often bringing shame due to its STD-like symptoms. The women in the portraits wear traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their courage in speaking out about the disease. The exhibit aims to emphasize their bravery in confronting taboos and highlighting the water's inescapable presence in their lives.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments, citing its unconstitutionality. Civil liberties groups argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. The ruling is considered a victory for religious freedom advocates, although the state plans to appeal, potentially taking the case to the Supreme Court. Similar laws in Arkansas and Texas are facing legal challenges, setting the stage for a potential landmark Supreme Court decision on religion in schools.</p>

          <p>This article presents five reasons to be grateful for air conditioning, arguing that it is more than just a luxury. Air conditioning saves lives by mitigating the dangers of extreme heat, keeps people productive at work and school, and improves sleep quality. It has also enabled the development of industries like film and microchip manufacturing, and allowed millions to live and travel in previously uninhabitable regions. While acknowledging the environmental impact, the author advocates for more efficient and cleaner air conditioning rather than its abandonment.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a patient with a failing heart and high antibody levels, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant after living with an LVAD for four years. The liver transplant was intended to reduce the risk of organ rejection. Though she faced complications, including COVID-19, the surgery was successful, paving the way for similar procedures in the future. Despite the success of the surgery, Baker is now facing financial difficulties due to medical bills and the recent death of her husband.</p>
