          <p>Tommy Fleetwood, an English golfer, has taken a three-shot lead at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut as he seeks his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood shot a seven-under-par 63 on Saturday, placing him ahead of Americans Russell Henley and Keegan Bradley. Henley surged into contention with a nine-under-par 61, while Scottie Scheffler struggled with a two-over 72, and Rory McIlroy shot a two-under 68, hurting his chances with a double bogey on the 12th. Fleetwood's impressive performance has positioned him favorably heading into the final round. The tournament is known for its challenging course and competitive field, setting the stage for an exciting finish. Optimism hinges on Fleetwood's ability to maintain his lead and secure his long-awaited victory.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers lost to the Washington Nationals 7-3 after giving up five home runs, while hitting three of their own. Dustin May pitched six innings, allowing five hits, five strikeouts, and two walks. James Wood and Luis Garcia Jr. hit solo home runs in the fourth inning for the Nationals. Climate change researchers have suggested that warmer climates could contribute to more home runs.

          <p>In Muscatine, Iowa, Vietnam veterans who left high school early to serve their country were finally awarded their diplomas. Dennis Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy before his junior year, was among those honored. Snyder, along with 81-year-old Richard Hill, joined the Muscatine High class of 2025 in cap and gown. The veterans participated in Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program, which has given over 100 veterans the chance to graduate.

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at the earliest stage. The non-invasive test kit can simultaneously assess the risk for up to seven types of cancer. The "miSignal" test kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine. A survey using the test kits detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman and precancerous cells in the colon and pancreas of six others. The kit could be vital in places with sparse medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. The four phases each reflect a unique metabolic state, similar to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine. This approach highlights the importance of balance between passive and active forces to maintain harmony.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets" to support the struggling housing market. These online and offline hubs aim to provide consumers with a transparent and efficient way to view homes. Chengdu is the latest city to launch such a platform, partnering with developers to feature projects on a mobile app. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, with some including second-hand listings and physical storefronts. The centrally managed platforms aim to minimize false promotions and reduce information asymmetry.</p>
