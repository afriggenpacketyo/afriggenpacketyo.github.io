          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region displayed varied results, influenced by a tech rally on Wall Street. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 initially hit a record high before closing lower following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, which has investors anticipating new fiscal stimulus. Conversely, Indonesia's market saw a significant drop after President Prabowo Subianto unexpectedly replaced the finance minister, causing the rupiah to weaken. Other markets like South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index posted gains, tracking positive momentum from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially announced her candidacy for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, becoming the most senior figure to enter the contest to replace Angela Rayner. She joins backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who has criticized the tight nomination window as unfair to the party's membership. Candidates must secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs by Thursday evening to proceed. Phillipson positioned herself as a "proud working-class woman" ready to fight against the threat posed by the Reform party, emphasizing her experience in defeating Nigel Farage's influence in the North East.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch family has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the conservative media empire, including Fox News and News Corp. The deal involves buying out the interests of his three older, more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—who will receive approximately $1.1 billion each and cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with shares in the companies. This resolution ends all litigation over the family trust and ensures the media conglomerate's conservative direction will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. The arrangement follows years of internal family turmoil.</p>

The upgraded protocol, which concluded negotiations in May, aims to broaden market access in key sectors like agriculture and digital trade.

          <p>At a virtual summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged fellow BRICS nations to address significant trade deficits with New Delhi, even as the bloc united against U.S. tariffs. India's trade imbalances have grown, particularly with China, where the deficit reached a record high, and with Russia, due to increased oil imports. While other members like Brazil and China took a strong stance against U.S. "hegemonism" and "protectionism," India's focus highlighted its distinct economic priorities within the group. The discussion underscores the different strategic views within BRICS, with India emphasizing economic initiatives while China and Russia often view it through a geopolitical lens.
