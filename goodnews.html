Funds are allocated for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, a supercomputer in Edinburgh, and the Acorn Project in St Fergus. This review allocates day-to-day and capital spending for the next few years, excluding funds spent by Holyrood. The Scottish government will then be free to allocate the block grant as they wish, so they can pass on the health spending at the same rate as England, or apply that money to another priority.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, and Blake Snell are making progress in their recoveries from injuries, raising hopes for their return to the Dodgers' pitching rotation sooner than anticipated. Ohtani threw his third live batting practice, Glasnow threw a bullpen session, and Snell threw 15 pitches in the bullpen. Manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism, hinting at a potential return for Ohtani before the All-Star break. These developments signal a positive turn for the Dodgers' pitching staff, which has been facing a wave of injuries.</p>

          <h2>White House Pleased with Events in Los Angeles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is reportedly pleased with the events unfolding in Los Angeles regarding the protests and the deployment of military forces. Officials believe that the situation highlights their focus on immigration and law and order, positioning Democrats on the wrong side of both issues. The decision to federalize the California National Guard and dispatch active-duty Marines marks a break with decades of tradition limiting the use of the military on American soil.</p>
