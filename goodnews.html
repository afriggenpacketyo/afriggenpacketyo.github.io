          <p>Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console launched with excitement, resulting in shortages and special store opening hours in several markets. The company hopes this new console will continue the success of the original Switch, which has sold over 152 million units. Demand appears strong, with Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa noting that the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 in Japan was beyond expectations. While shortages are expected to persist in Japan, availability seems better in the U.K., and Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with analysts predicting even higher sales numbers. The launch signifies a positive outlook for Nintendo and the gaming industry, driven by innovative portable design and strong consumer interest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, reducing the deposit facility rate to 2%, following a dip in Euro zone inflation below the 2% target. The ECB's decision is based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook and the strength of monetary policy transmission, though one governing council member opposed the cut. While the ECB revised its inflation forecast downward, it left the growth forecast unchanged at 0.9%, citing uncertainty surrounding trade policies and geopolitical tensions. The rate cut reflects an attempt to stimulate the Euro zone economy amid concerns over trade and rising geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
