          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions has secured a new investment from tech giant Samsung as it prepares for an upcoming funding round and eventual public listing. Rebellions, which resulted from a merger with rival Sapeon, is positioned as a key South Korean competitor to Nvidia in the AI hardware space. The company is currently seeking to raise between $150 and $200 million, which would push its valuation above its previous $1 billion mark. Rebellions is collaborating with Samsung's foundry business to manufacture its next-generation 'Rebel' chip, a strategic partnership that could significantly benefit both companies in the competitive semiconductor market.

          <p>China has developed a new AI-powered weather warning system named Mazu, designed to help developing nations better prepare for natural disasters. According to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the system is built for global reach and aims to create an early warning partnership network to jointly tackle extreme weather events. The initiative is part of China's effort to share its technological advancements, with its Fengyun satellites already providing data to 133 countries. Officials stated that Mazu will serve as a symbol of a joint global response to the increasing challenges posed by extreme weather, with co-development projects already underway with countries like Ethiopia and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has reinstated its financial guidance, signaling a gradual recovery in the second half of the year despite reporting a first-half net loss of €2.3 billion. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Peugeot, anticipates increased net revenues and improved cash flow, though it updated its full-year tariff impact to approximately €1.5 billion. CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged that 2025 is a tough year but expressed confidence in fixing issues by capitalizing on the company's strengths and new products. The guidance assumes current trade rules, including a new 15% U.S. tariff on most EU goods, will remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the viral popularity of the collectible Labubu monster dolls, another furry toy, the Monchhichi, is experiencing a resurgence, with influencers highlighting its history. Created in Japan in 1974, the monkey-like doll became a global sensation in the 1980s and was particularly popular in West Germany. In communist East Germany, where Western imports were banned, a local version called the Tiemi was produced and became a beloved item throughout the Eastern Bloc. Today, as the Labubu craze drives interest in unique collectibles, these vintage East German Tiemi dolls have themselves become sought-after items, reflecting a nostalgia for quirky and historical toys.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays exceeded profit expectations for the second quarter and announced a £1 billion share buyback, driven by a surge in its investment banking division. The bank reported a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, beating forecasts, as market volatility from events like U.S. tariff policy changes boosted trading income. The investment banking unit saw its income rise 10% year-on-year to £3.3 billion, helping to offset challenges in other areas. CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan stated that the bank's three-year strategic plan remains on track to deliver higher and more stable returns for investors amid a shifting and competitive banking landscape.

          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets for a new striker, should the club decide to reinforce its attack this transfer window. However, United's hierarchy acknowledges that any new signings are contingent on off-loading unwanted players first to generate funds, a process that might not conclude until closer to the September deadline. Acquiring either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell the 29-year-old Watkins, and Newcastle is also reportedly interested in the 22-year-old Sesko. United feels Villa's stance might soften, but considers the rumored £60m price for Watkins to be too high.</p>

          <p>Following the Belgian Grand Prix, key questions in Formula 1 include the management of wet race conditions, Lewis Hamilton's recent performance, and the outlook for Red Bull's new engine in 2026. While some drivers felt the race start was overly cautious, most acknowledged the paramount importance of safety at the dangerous Spa circuit. Hamilton's uncharacteristic errors in qualifying were attributed to specific setup changes on his car rather than a larger decline in form. Regarding Red Bull's 2026 engine, while there are rumors of a performance deficit, the true competitive landscape will remain unknown until the new regulations, which also involve new fuels and electrical systems, are in effect.</p>

          <p>Qatar's bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics is seen as a logical next step, but it faces significant hurdles, including weather, image perception, and regional politics. While Qatar has proven its capability to host major events like the 2022 World Cup, an Olympics would need to be held in November, disrupting the global sports calendar. An Olympic scholar notes that the IOC prioritizes political and popular support, which could be complex to gauge in Qatar due to its small local population and large migrant workforce. Furthermore, concerns over human rights and competition from other potential host nations like Indonesia and Turkey present considerable challenges for the bid.</p>

          <p>India has overtaken China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., marking a significant shift in global manufacturing supply chains amid trade uncertainties. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, with shipment volumes soaring by 240%. This surge is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move more of its iPhone production to India to mitigate risks from U.S.-China trade tensions. In contrast, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. fell to 25%, down from 61% a year earlier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy program aimed at reversing the country's declining birth rate, offering parents 3,600 yuan ($500) annually for each child under the age of three. The policy, which applies retroactively from the start of the year, is expected to help approximately 20 million families with the high cost of raising children. This move comes as China faces a demographic crisis with a shrinking and rapidly aging population, despite abolishing its one-child policy nearly a decade ago. The country is one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child relative to income.</p>
