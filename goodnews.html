        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing significantly narrowed its quarterly losses and reported a 35% revenue increase, driven by the highest number of aircraft deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg labeled 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," pointing to improved production stability and performance, although the company still reported an adjusted loss of $1.24 per share. The results were impacted by a charge related to a Justice Department settlement over the 737 Max crashes. While the company is stabilizing production of the 737 Max, it announced that certification for its Max 7 and Max 10 models is now delayed until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a visit to his Scottish golf resort, Donald Trump held a meeting with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney to discuss several key issues. The conversation covered the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, with Swinney advocating for an exemption for the vital Scottish export. They also discussed the ongoing conflict in Gaza and U.S. taxes on North Sea oil and gas production, which Trump criticized as being too high. The meeting concluded a four-day trip for Trump, who also gifted Swinney a figurine of an American bald eagle while receiving historical documents related to his mother's Scottish heritage.</p>

          <h2>Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern Announce Proposed $85 Billion Merger to Form First U.S. Transcontinental Railroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:40:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single coast-to-coast railroad in United States history. The companies argue the merger would streamline national deliveries by eliminating handoff delays, but the plan faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators concerned about market consolidation. If approved, the deal would likely pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue a similar merger to remain competitive. The railroads plan to submit their application for approval within six months, hoping for a decision by early 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>IMF Raises Global Growth Forecast, Citing Easing Trade Tensions and Government Stimulus</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly attributing the improvement to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and proactive government measures. The report noted a recent surge in U.S. imports as companies moved to preempt higher taxes, which temporarily boosted economic activity. The IMF now projects global growth of 3.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, though it warns that persistent trade uncertainty could still weaken the economy. For the UK, growth is expected to be 1.2% this year, making it one of the faster-growing advanced economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card credit card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. The move would see the nation's largest credit card issuer absorb Apple's significant loan book, further solidifying its market dominance. For Goldman Sachs, exiting the partnership would mark the end of a challenging venture into consumer credit that was marked by high growth but also significant loan-loss provisions and regulatory scrutiny. The deal would provide Apple with a more established and disciplined partner in JPMorgan, which is expected to negotiate stricter terms for servicing the popular credit card.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that beat Wall Street forecasts, but the company issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year. P&G warned that new tariffs are expected to create a $1 billion pretax headwind, contributing to a 6% drag on core earnings growth. In response, the consumer goods giant plans mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products, which include brands like Tide and Charmin. The company described the current consumer as increasingly "value-seeking" and "selective," reflecting a challenging economic environment even as it navigates higher costs.

          <p>Following a recent deadly train derailment caused by a landslide after heavy rain, Germany is intensifying efforts to make its railway infrastructure more resilient to climate change. The national railway company, Deutsche Bahn, is implementing a heavy rainfall plan and redesigning bridges to better withstand flooding, a problem highlighted by the catastrophic 2021 Ahr Valley floods. To combat fire risks from heat and drought, the company is managing trackside vegetation and testing new watering techniques. Additionally, it is upgrading signaling technology and train components, like air conditioning systems, to better handle extreme temperatures. </p>

          <p>Economists widely anticipate that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rates at its upcoming meeting, despite President Trump's persistent calls for a rate cut. The central bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range as it continues to monitor inflation, which rose to 2.7% in June, above the Fed's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently stated that policy decisions are driven by economic data, not political pressure. While some Fed governors have signaled a desire to lower rates, the consensus remains that the Fed will wait until at least its September meeting before considering a cut.</p>

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the ancient settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence that the 9,000-year-old society was organized around women. DNA analysis of individuals buried under the same houses revealed they were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilineal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This modern genetic research confirms long-held archaeological theories that were previously based only on female figurines found at the site. The findings suggest women held an elevated societal position in one of the world's oldest continually inhabited places.</p>

While the numbers represent a conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain, primarily from habitat fragmentation due to deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects. These developments divide tiger habitats into smaller, isolated patches, which affects their movement, breeding, and access to prey. Conservationists stress that protecting the quality and connectivity of these habitats is crucial to securing the long-term future of the species, even as their overall numbers appear healthy.</p>
