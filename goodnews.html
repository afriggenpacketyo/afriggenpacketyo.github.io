        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with initial rides in Model Y vehicles within a geofenced area, though access is by invitation only. Elon Musk has been promoting a driverless robotaxi for years, and analysts believe this venture could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization. The company plans to start with a small number of vehicles and gradually scale up the service, with launches in Los Angeles and San Francisco to follow. The success of this rollout is crucial for Tesla to deliver on its promises in the autonomous vehicle market. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Maghera, Northern Ireland, are taken aback by the installation of what may be the UK and Ireland's largest yellow box junction, stretching over 40 meters along a busy intersection. The aim of the box is to improve traffic flow on the A29 Tobermore Road, which is frequently used by buses, lorries, and cars. While some locals recognize the need for traffic improvements, others find the size of the box junction "ridiculous" and hope it may become a tourist attraction. The Department for Infrastructure has been contacted for comment on the unusual road marking. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Circle's shares extended their rally following the Senate's approval of the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin legislation, causing the stock to rise significantly. Coinbase shares also saw gains, as the crypto exchange operator receives a portion of the revenue from Circle's USDC reserves. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins have gained investor interest due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments, with companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring their use. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The band Haim's new album, "I Quit," remixes the breakup-music canon for a generation wary of marriage, delving into themes of unraveling commitments and personal liberation. The album reflects lead singer Danielle's split from her longtime producer, Ariel Rechtshaid, marking both a personal and artistic unchaining. Musically, "I Quit" is characterized by its surge and excess, blending various genres and styles with instinctual and playful arrangements. The lyrics explore post-breakup grief, anger, and horniness, capturing the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Jama Pediatrics reveals that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children, while states with more permissive laws have seen an increase. The study analyzed pediatric firearm death rates across states with varying gun control policies, finding that states with stricter laws, such as California and New York, saw decreased rates. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures that keep society safe from gun violence, such as universal background checks and safe-storage regulations. The research aims to inform policy decisions and promote strategies to protect children from gun violence. </p>

Darden is considering "strategic alternatives" for its Bahama Breeze brand, including a potential sale.

          <p>Recent votes in the UK Parliament indicate a significant social shift, with MPs voting to change abortion legislation and backing a change in the law to allow assisted dying in England and Wales. While the assisted dying vote will proceed to the House of Lords, it is now considered likely to pass, representing a colossal social change comparable to the Abortion Act of 1967. These decisions reflect a socially liberal shift in the UK's legal landscape. </p>
