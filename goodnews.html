          <p>The Trump administration is exploring policy changes to broaden access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure and declaring it an ‚ÄúEssential Health Benefit‚Äù under the Affordable Care Act, according to a New York Times article. The White House has been consulting with fertility experts and conservative groups, but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine reports they have not been invited to participate. The administration's efforts are complicated by conflicting views within Trump's base, as some Christian conservatives oppose IVF due to concerns about the disposal of embryos, while the White House aims to combat infertility and boost the U.S. birthrate.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, potentially allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The UK already has reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia. While details are scarce, the proposal has faced criticism, with some labeling it as "free movement through the back door." Supporters argue it would boost businesses and offer valuable opportunities for young people, but concerns remain about uncapped migration.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a plasma excitation technology that can significantly improve the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones, according to a study published in the Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Wind tunnel tests showed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could boost an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 percent. This technology has the potential to extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly for longer periods.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, experienced years of unexplained calf pain before finally being diagnosed with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). She consulted numerous doctors, some of whom dismissed her pain as psychological. After being diagnosed, she underwent a bypass surgery that was unsuccessful, and sought treatment from Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic. Lyden performed a surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles, relieving the compression on her popliteal artery, and now Prindle is recovering and regaining her strength.</p>

Experts determined its authenticity through spectral imaging and other tests. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people had personal rights, including royalty. The rediscovered document is believed to be from the final iteration of the Magna Carta in 1300, reminding us of the document's true wealth in what it says about individual rights and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Manvir Singh's book, "Shamanism: The Timeless Religion," explores the historical phenomenon of shamanism as a technology for dealing with uncertainty. Shamans are specialists who engage with unseen realities through non-ordinary states to provide services like healing and divination. Neo-shamanism in America emerged in the 1960s and 70s, focusing on the individual rather than the tribe, and mental states rather than bodily ailments. The article questions whether shamanism will be absorbed by the therapeutic Western self or find new containers and metaphors.</p>

The tariffs, which took effect on April 3, are expected to significantly dent profits at Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. While increasing local production is a long-term strategy, it may take years to reorganize supply chains. Automakers are also hesitant to raise prices drastically, as it could drive away customers in the competitive U.S. market.</p>
