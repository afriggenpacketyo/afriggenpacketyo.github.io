          <p>Austria's classically trained countertenor, JJ, secured victory at the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 in Basel, Switzerland, with his pop-opera song 'Wasted Love,' captivating an estimated 160 million viewers across Europe and beyond. Despite Sweden being the favorite, JJ's performance, chosen through a mix of viewer and jury votes, showcased the breadth of European music, from Portuguese guitar ballads to Latvian choirs. The event, though intended to celebrate European unity, faced controversy due to Israel's participation amidst pro-Palestinian protests. Organizers estimated over 500,000 people gathered in Basel for Eurovision week, celebrating music's unifying power.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for Chicago. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms that lifted dust from parched farmland. The event, reminiscent of Dust Bowl-era conditions, caused hazardous driving conditions and dramatically reduced visibility at Chicago Midway International Airport. The unusually dry soil conditions in central Illinois contributed to the severity of the storm, which meteorologists described as a haboob.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process rights for immigrants facing removal. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. This decision aligns with a series of cases where courts have emphasized the importance of allowing immigrants to challenge their deportations. Legal scholars have praised the courts' defense of due process, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer insisted this scheme would not equate to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, emphasizing its reciprocal nature. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the proposal as 'free movement through the back door.' An agreement is expected at a summit between the UK and the EU, though it will only be an agreement in principle.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator with a pencil sharpener-like mouth, in the Canadian Rockies. The creature, nicknamed the 'sea moth,' provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The Mosura possessed jointed claws with long spines, body flaps for swimming, and a segmented body similar to modern arthropods. This discovery reveals that radiodonts, the extinct group to which Mosura belonged, were more complex than previously thought.</p>
