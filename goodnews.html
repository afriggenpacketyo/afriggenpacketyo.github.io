          <p>Millions of people participated in "No Kings" protests across the United States, organized by a coalition of advocacy groups to demonstrate against perceived abuses of power by the Trump administration. The rallies focused on issues such as immigration policies, the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, and what organizers describe as a trend toward authoritarianism. Speakers like Bill Nye and Senator Adam Schiff addressed large crowds, while Republican leaders criticized the events, labeling them "Hate America" rallies. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, with organizers emphasizing their actions were rooted in a love for the country and its democratic principles.</p>

In his address, Vance honored the Corps' history and reassured service members that the administration would fight to ensure they are paid amid political battles in Washington. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth also delivered a speech, emphasizing that the military's strength lies in its unity of purpose rather than diversity. The event took place amid a dispute with California's governor over a temporary closure of a nearby freeway for the demonstration.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese company, AMIES Technology, is generating optimism for China's goal of self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry. As a spin-off from the state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), AMIES aims to accelerate the commercialization of lithography equipment, a critical area where China lags and faces U.S. export controls on advanced systems from Dutch leader ASML. While its parent company SMEE has focused on less advanced back-end processes, AMIES represents a renewed effort to break the bottleneck in front-end wafer fabrication. China's most advanced domestic tools currently support less sophisticated processes around the 90-nanometer node. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's largest airlines, including China Eastern, are now offering free basic Wi-Fi on many domestic routes in an effort to attract business travelers back from the country's extensive high-speed train network. The move is a direct response to the competitive pressure from railways, which allow passengers to remain connected and productive during their journey. China Eastern has rolled out the service on all its widebody aircraft covering 37 key domestic routes. The initiative reflects a broader strategy within China's aviation industry to enhance the passenger experience and regain market share for inter-city travel.</p>

          <p>The town of Terrassa in Catalonia, Spain, has implemented a temporary ban on the adoption of black cats from local shelters to protect them from potential harm during the Halloween season. The measure, effective from early October to mid-November, aims to prevent the animals from being used in sinister "rituals" or as mere props. Local officials noted that requests to adopt black cats often spike around Halloween. While there have been no recorded incidents of cruelty in Terrassa, the city council enacted the ban as a precaution based on warnings from animal welfare groups about incidents elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Actor and TV personality Joe Swash is sharing his personal experiences of becoming a father at 24 in a new BBC documentary titled "Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads." Swash reveals he felt "grossly underprepared" and unsupported, lacking male role models after his own father died when he was young. In the film, he meets with other young fathers to explore the social stereotypes and lack of support services they often face. The documentary aims to challenge the negative perceptions surrounding young dads and highlight the need for better resources and positive role models to help them navigate parenthood.</p>

          <p>A recently constructed railway connecting China and Laos has emerged as a crucial strategic asset for Beijing, enabling it to secure large quantities of potassium. This resource is essential for producing fertilizer for modern agriculture, a sector where China has historically been vulnerable due to its limited domestic reserves. For decades, China depended on imports from North America, which holds the world's largest potassium deposits. The new "potassium railway" through Laos significantly reduces this dependency, strengthening China's position in global trade and enhancing its food security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from the BBC nine years ago, has resulted in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud scheme. The conspiracy, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare (SMT), targeted over 3,500 mostly elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts. Instead of helping them, SMT used high-pressure tactics to sell them useless "credits" while taking their money to fund a lavish lifestyle for the company's owners. The case is described as one of the largest frauds of its kind in the UK.</p>

Host Jonathan Ross and comedian Alan Carr have previously interviewed many of their fellow contestants on their respective chat shows. Other links include actors who have appeared in the same films, athletes who know each other from the sports world, and comedians from the same circuit. These relationships influence the gameplay, creating alliances, personal betrayals, and suspicion, as seen when Alan Carr "murdered" his real-life friend, singer Paloma Faith.</p>
