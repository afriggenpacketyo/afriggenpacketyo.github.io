          <p>Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to begin in Egypt following Hamas's conditional acceptance of a U.S.-proposed peace plan, raising hopes for an end to the war in Gaza. The deal reportedly includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for amnesty for Hamas members who disarm, with a provisional government to eventually be established. While the Israeli military has been ordered to halt operations, skepticism remains as Hamas wishes to negotiate the details, including the timeline for Israeli withdrawal and the specifics of disarmament. The plan, brokered with involvement from the Trump administration, comes as parts of Gaza are officially under famine conditions.</p>

          <p>Actor George Clooney has explained his decision to raise his 8-year-old twins, Ella and Alexander, primarily on a farm in France rather than in Los Angeles. In a recent interview, Clooney expressed concerns that his children would not get a "fair shake at life" if immersed in the culture of Hollywood, where they would face constant paparazzi and comparisons to other famous children. He and his wife, Amal Clooney, prefer a quieter, more grounded upbringing for their kids, where they can have a more normal life away from the pressures of fame. The family values creating private moments and spaces to protect their children from public intrusion.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered a significant, multi-year agreement to purchase AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a move that strengthens AMD's position as a serious competitor to market leader Nvidia. The deal, which AMD expects to generate tens of billions in revenue, also includes warrants that could give OpenAI an ownership stake in the chipmaker. This partnership focuses on using AMD's chips for AI inference, the day-to-day running of models, diversifying OpenAI's hardware supply beyond its long-standing reliance on Nvidia for both training and inference. The development reflects the intense and growing demand for high-performance computing power in the AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This newly created CEO position will involve overseeing all daily operations at the tax agency. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, will report directly to Bessent while continuing his leadership role at the SSA. The Treasury Department cited the shared technological and customer service goals of both agencies as a key reason for the dual appointment, which follows a period of leadership instability at the IRS.</p>

          <p>South Africa delivered a commanding performance to defeat New Zealand by six wickets at the Women's Cricket World Cup, marking a significant turnaround after their heavy loss to England. Chasing New Zealand's total of 231, South Africa reached their target comfortably, led by a brilliant century from Tazmin Brits, who scored 101. Earlier, South Africa's bowlers restricted New Zealand, who collapsed from a strong position of 187-3 to lose their last seven wickets for just 44 runs. The victory revitalizes South Africa's campaign, while New Zealand faces increased pressure after a lackluster performance with both bat and ball.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly resumed processing student loan forgiveness for some borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, according to a trade group. The debt cancellation for these long-term borrowers had been paused since July, a move the Department of Education attributed to court actions that blocked the separate SAVE repayment plan. Borrowers who have made payments for 20 to 25 years under IBR are now receiving notices that their remaining debt will be erased. The resumption of forgiveness comes amid a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers accusing the administration of unlawfully depriving borrowers of their rights.</p>

          <p>Conservative politician Sanae Takaichi has been chosen as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, setting her on course to become the nation's first-ever female prime minister. A staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vision, Takaichi faces immediate challenges, including addressing inflation, managing diplomatic relations with the U.S., and maintaining her party's coalition government. Her hardline conservative stances, including visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, have already created tension with her party's long-time moderate coalition partner.

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated that she is "not afraid" despite facing regular protests and death threats following the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Barrett explained that she has learned to handle the constant criticism in a businesslike manner, refusing to let it affect her emotionally or reward threats with fear. She emphasized her commitment to an originalist judicial philosophy, similar to her mentor Antonin Scalia, and strives to apply the law neutrally without personal or political bias. This disciplined approach, she noted, is crucial for making decisions that concern the institution of the presidency, not just the current president.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have made homeownership more affordable, with the average 30-year fixed rate currently at 6.34%, down from nearly 7% at the start of the year. For a $550,000 mortgage, this decrease translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,419, which is over $200 less per month compared to January's rates. This reduction in borrowing costs provides significant savings for new homebuyers and also creates a favorable environment for existing homeowners to consider refinancing their current loans. However, potential refinancers must weigh the savings against closing costs to determine if it is a financially sound decision. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The superstructure, or "island," on almost all aircraft carriers is located on the starboard (right) side of the flight deck for a critical aerodynamic reason related to propeller-driven aircraft. Early pilots discovered that the clockwise rotation of most Western aircraft engines naturally causes the plane to yaw to the left during takeoff and landing, a phenomenon known as the "P Factor." Placing the island on the right side provided a clear visual reference for pilots and kept the structure out of the way of this natural leftward drift. This design choice, established over a century ago, has become a standard feature in aircraft carrier construction.</p>

This move is part of Novo Nordisk's strategy to make the high-demand medications more accessible and affordable for consumers. Costco members will still require a valid prescription from a healthcare provider to purchase the drugs, which are used to manage Type 2 diabetes and for weight loss.</p>
