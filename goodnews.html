        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>America Online (AOL) has announced it will shut down its iconic dial-up internet service at the end of September, marking the end of an era for millions. The distinctive sound of a modem connecting was the soundtrack to the early internet for a generation, as AOL grew to over 23 million subscribers at its peak in the late 1990s. The service has since been largely replaced by faster broadband technologies like cable internet. Currently, only about 175,000 U.S. households still use dial-up, making the service's retirement a nostalgic but inevitable step in technological progression.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 11:29:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The online retail landscape is facing a major transformation as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are expected to integrate direct checkout functionalities. This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface, bypassing the need to visit a merchant's website. Experts suggest this shift could disrupt the entire e-commerce value chain, with the focus moving from who closes the sale to who controls the pre-sale customer engagement. While this poses a threat to traditional e-commerce platforms like Amazon and payment processors, it also presents an opportunity for AI companies to monetize user attention through a new retail media model.</p>

          <p>The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has approved a proposal to host a La Liga match between Villarreal and Barcelona in the United States. The game, scheduled for December, would be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, which is also a venue for the 2026 World Cup. This move marks a significant step towards playing a regular season European league fixture abroad. The RFEF will now seek the necessary authorization from both UEFA and FIFA to finalize the plan, potentially paving the way for more international league games in the future.</p>

While its customer base is still shrinking, the average order value has increased for seven straight quarters, and customer retention is improving. The company is also leveraging AI and revamping its private brands to regain momentum in a competitive market, though it still faces challenges in achieving sustained profitability.

          <p>Dame Stephanie Shirley, a trailblazing figure in the technology industry and a dedicated philanthropist, has passed away at the age of 91. Arriving in Britain as a child refugee from Nazi Germany, she later founded a software company in 1962 that almost exclusively hired women with children, offering flexible home-based work. Known for adopting the name "Steve" to navigate the male-dominated business world, she built a successful company and later donated most of her fortune, nearly £70 million, to charitable causes, particularly those supporting autism research and IT projects. She is remembered as an inspirational and formidable advocate for women in tech.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have reached an unusual agreement with the Trump administration to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China. In exchange, the semiconductor giants will receive the necessary export licenses to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted. Analysts view the deal as a transactional approach by the White House, allowing U.S. firms to compete with Chinese rivals like Huawei in a critical market. While investors see it as a net positive, the arrangement sets a strange precedent and raises long-term questions about future government involvement in tech exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers are considering whether to place funds in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) or a certificate of deposit (CD). Experts advise that HYSAs are better for those who need liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer easy access to cash without penalties. Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who can lock away their money for a set period, as they typically offer a higher, guaranteed rate of return, which is advantageous if rates are expected to fall. For some, a "CD ladder" or splitting funds between both options can provide a balance of higher earnings and accessibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Newcomers Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz had encouraging debuts, contributing to the team's goals, but the team was defensively open and vulnerable, a trend seen throughout their pre-season. The team is adapting to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, and the absence of key midfielders exposed gaps that Crystal Palace exploited. While the new attacking options look exciting, the article suggests Liverpool may face defensive challenges as they integrate new players and tactics early in the season.</p>
