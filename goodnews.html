          <p>A four-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who requires specialized medical treatment for short bowel syndrome, has been granted humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her and her mother to remain in the United States. Sofia's condition prevents her from properly absorbing nutrients and fluids, requiring specialized IV treatments administered in the U.S.. Her lawyers emphasized the urgency of the situation, as the treatment is essential for her survival and cannot be obtained in Mexico. The legal victory followed advocacy and pressure from elected officials, highlighting systemic challenges in the immigration system.</p>

          <p>Japanese police have arrested four individuals, including an executive from Daigo Ivory Co., for allegedly selling elephant tusks as mammoth tusks at an online auction. This was reportedly done to circumvent a trade ban on elephant ivory. The suspects allegedly sold ivory products worth around 100 million yen annually by mislabeling them as mammoth ivory. The case came to light following a tip from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the suspects have admitted to the allegations.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders criticizes the Democratic Party for lacking a progressive agenda and failing to address the needs of working-class people. He argues that the Democrats' message, which focuses on maintaining the status quo, does not resonate with the majority of Americans. Sanders emphasizes the need to challenge the billionaire class and advocate for policies such as healthcare for all, affordable childcare, and tuition-free public colleges. He believes the Democrats' weakness lies in their low credibility and lack of a strong message for working people, beyond simply opposing Trump.</p>
