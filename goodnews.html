          <p>Singer Cassie Ventura and her husband, Alex Fine, have welcomed their third child. The news comes shortly after Ventura testified in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, where she recounted alleged abuse during their on-and-off relationship. Ventura had announced her pregnancy in February with a series of photos on Instagram, and she and Fine were married in October 2019 after meeting at the gym. This latest development adds a personal chapter to Ventura's life amidst the ongoing legal proceedings involving Combs, where she is a key witness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump defended his tariff strategy, rejecting the notion that he is "chickening out" when he delays or lightens tariff threats. He argued that these actions are part of a negotiation process, citing the European Union as an example, where a 50% tariff threat led to trade talks. Trump believes his approach helps the U.S. gain ground in trade negotiations, despite criticisms that he backs down. He expressed frustration that when he reaches reasonable deals, he is accused of being weak, which he finds unbelievable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed barriers in 401(k) plans to buying cryptocurrency and related digital assets like NFTs and meme coins. The Labor Department rescinded guidance put in place by the Biden-era Labor Department in 2022 that aimed to safeguard 401(k) investors from such digital assets. The shift signals to employers that they can add digital assets to their 401(k) lineups at will and without consequence. Some observers will likely view the Labor Department move as an olive branch to the pro-crypto crowd, signaling to employers that they can add digital assets to their 401(k) lineups at will and without consequence (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising recent college graduates to begin saving for retirement as soon as possible to leverage the benefits of compound interest and long-term market participation. Despite potential market volatility, experts emphasize that time in the market is more important than timing the market. They recommend investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes, with a heavier allocation to stocks for younger investors. As investors age, they can gradually shift a larger percentage of their portfolios to bond funds to reduce risk (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a peculiar object in the Milky Way galaxy emitting both X-rays and radio waves in a repeating cycle every 44 minutes. Located 15,000 light-years away, the object's emissions are unlike any known galactic entity, leading scientists to speculate it could be a highly magnetized dead star or something entirely new. The X-ray emissions were spotted by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, marking the first time such emissions have been observed from a long-period radio transient.
