The court clarified that the state law prohibiting texting or talking on a cellphone while driving also applies to viewing maps on a handheld device. Mounted phones are exempt, but merely looking at a map on a handheld phone can result in a ticket. The ruling aims to reduce distracted driving and encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road.</p>
