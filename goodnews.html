          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 19:42:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a major review of its parental leave and pay systems for new parents, encompassing maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the system has not been seriously examined in decades and needs modernization. Campaign groups have praised the review, calling the current system one of the worst in the developed world, with paternity leave being particularly ungenerous. The review will address low take-up of shared leave and the financial barriers preventing many fathers from taking time off.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has formally requested that 200 of them be returned to California's command. This move comes as the state's wildfire season intensifies, leaving its specialized firefighting unit, Task Force Rattlesnake, critically understaffed. The troops were federalized by the Trump administration to respond to immigration-related unrest, a move Governor Gavin Newsom has legally challenged. Newsom praised the request, urging the president to end the "political theater" and allow the troops to resume their essential firefighting duties.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing stock market trends by favoring companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas over traditional metrics. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their innovative concepts, while penalizing established giants like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas, such as prioritizing stock buybacks. This shift indicates a "story-dominated market" where the potential of individual company narratives is valued more highly than broad macroeconomic indicators like Federal Reserve policies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical obstacles are a primary reason for declining childhood vaccination rates in the UK, rather than vaccine hesitancy. Experts found that difficulties in booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear information are preventing many parents from getting their children vaccinated. This has contributed to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. The report calls for improved access, such as using NHS apps for booking and expanding vaccination services to overcome these logistical hurdles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in an interview that the company has not yet observed significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including extensive forward-buying of inventory by both Amazon and its third-party sellers before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace, with millions of sellers, means many will absorb costs to gain market share rather than raise prices. This approach has so far helped cushion customers from the direct financial impact of the trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not caused a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies aggressively pre-ordering inventory to "front-load" before the duties took effect. Additionally, many businesses are temporarily absorbing the costs to avoid losing customers and are using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these strategies have cushioned the immediate impact, experts warn that prices are still likely to rise later in the year if tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>
