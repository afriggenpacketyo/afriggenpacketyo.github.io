          <p>A research team in China has created a new genomic tool called "Uni-C" that could revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer. This single-cell technology analyzes circulating tumor cells in the blood, decoding three layers of genomic information simultaneously. The method promises to deliver results in less than a day with accuracy comparable to traditional biopsies, offering significant hope for earlier screening and personalized immunotherapy for one of the deadliest cancers. The breakthrough provides a comprehensive profile of the tumor from just a small blood sample.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but significantly better than the 0.1% expansion that analysts had predicted. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this unexpected growth. Despite the positive figures, which prompted some investment banks to raise their annual forecasts, economists express caution about maintaining this pace due to the weak global economy and potential impacts of future tax policies.

          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, exceeding market expectations. This significant growth is primarily attributed to the surging demand for its artificial intelligence server business, which has become a key partner for Nvidia. For the first time, sales from server products constituted the largest share of revenue at 41%, surpassing its consumer electronics division. The company anticipates its AI server business will continue to drive strong growth, projecting a revenue increase of over 170% year-over-year for the segment. (not investment advice)</p>

After being extradited from Scotland, where he claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, a jury convicted him following a three-day trial. Prosecutors detailed how Rossi took advantage of a vulnerable woman, with the relationship quickly becoming controlling before the assault occurred. Rossi, who faces another sexual assault trial in September, could be sentenced to five years to life in prison for this conviction.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move that analysts believe could create an opportunity for improved counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China. The BLA has been responsible for attacks in Pakistan, some of which have targeted Chinese nationals and interests, causing concern in Beijing. By taking this step, the Trump administration is seen as addressing a shared security threat. This action may provide a rare area of alignment, potentially easing tensions and opening a dialogue on counterterrorism efforts through their mutual relationship with Pakistan.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide to the Business and Technology Education Council (BTec) qualifications, which are vocational courses popular in the UK. BTecs are assessed through a combination of coursework, projects, and exams, offering a more practical alternative to traditional academic routes like A-levels. The qualifications come in different levels, with Level 2 BTec Firsts being equivalent to GCSEs and Level 3 BTec Nationals equivalent to A-levels, often used as a pathway to university or direct employment. The grading scale ranges from Pass to Starred Distinction, and the government has recently reversed plans to scrap funding for many of these key courses.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for the New Mexico state House, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for organizing a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials. Following his election loss in November 2022, Peña hired accomplices to carry out the attacks, fueled by unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. He was convicted on 13 felony charges, including conspiracy and intimidation, for the shootings that occurred between December 2022 and January 2023. Although no one was injured, the attacks targeted four officials, and Peña was found to have personally participated in one of them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the concept of secondary sanctions, a foreign policy tool frequently used by the United States to influence global affairs. Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a country's own citizens, secondary sanctions target third-party entities—countries, companies, or individuals—that do business with a sanctioned regime. Their effectiveness stems from the dominance of the U.S. dollar and financial system, as third parties often comply to avoid losing access to American markets. The article examines their use against countries like Iran and Russia, noting that while they can be a powerful threat, their success depends on credibility and they risk pushing targeted nations into closer alliances.

          <p>The Supreme Court of South Korea has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, the creator of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." American composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song, seeking financial damages. However, the court upheld previous lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The decision affirms that the melody is based on a traditional American summer camp chant that is in the public domain, concluding a long-running legal dispute over the globally popular song.</p>
