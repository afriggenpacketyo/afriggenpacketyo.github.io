          <p>Official campaigning has commenced for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining a key factor. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats, especially with approval ratings for his Cabinet sometimes dipping below the "danger level." Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, particularly unaffiliated ones, while major issues at stake include rising living costs, political funding scandals, and regional concerns.</p>

          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth element (REE) reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates global supply. With the third-largest reserves globally, India aims to leverage Indian Rare Earths (IREL) to increase production and provide an alternative source. Despite substantial reserves, India lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan. Experts highlight the need for public and private investment to overcome challenges such as specialized technical expertise and infrastructure in mining regions.</p>

          <p>A Chinese think tank has suggested that China and the U.S. establish a "security dialogue mechanism" for the South China Sea to prevent conflict in the contested waterway. The Grandview Institution in Beijing highlighted confrontational dynamics in aerial and maritime interactions but noted that competition remains manageable. The report calls for institutionalized dialogue mechanisms focused on regional security architecture, maritime legal order, and crisis response protocols. This proposal aims to mitigate the risk of inadvertent escalation and promote consistent implementation of crisis management tools.</p>

          <p>Coffee's global consumption is deeply rooted in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, evolving from ancient ceremonies to modern-day TikTok trends. Originating in Ethiopia, coffee spread through trade and spiritual journeys, becoming integral to traditions like the Ethiopian coffee ceremony and Turkish coffee fortune-telling. Cafes have historically served as incubators of ideas and revolution, while unique preparations like Finnish coffee cheese and Vietnamese egg coffee showcase its adaptability. Despite challenges like rising global temperatures affecting coffee farmers, the beverage remains an intrinsic part of world culture, with approximately two billion cups consumed daily.</p>

          <p>In response to tariffs imposed by the United States, China is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. While international L/Cs are limited to physical goods, domestic versions can also be used in the trade of services, offering greater flexibility for businesses navigating trade challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping for special treatment in tariff negotiations with the United States, particularly concerning auto tariffs, as President Trump hints at further increases. Tokyo's negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed confidence that Japan would receive separate treatment once a bilateral deal is finalized. Trump's potential tariff hike on auto imports aims to attract more investment in American manufacturing, which could negatively impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to make progress in the talks ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and Trump.</p>
