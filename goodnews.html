          <p>The European Parliament and China's National People's Congress are scheduled to hold their first formal talks in seven years on October 16 in Brussels. This meeting signals a significant thaw in relations, which had deteriorated to the point of mutual sanctions in 2021 over human rights concerns in Xinjiang. The discussions, led by German lawmaker Engin Eroglu on the European side, are expected to re-establish a biannual exchange between the two legislative bodies. The move aims to mend diplomatic ties and foster renewed cooperation between the two powers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently, the storm is moving over open waters and does not pose an immediate threat to land, though forecasters predict it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The storm's projected path shows it tracking north of the Caribbean, but it may approach Bermuda by next week as it continues to strengthen. This season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, with Gabrielle being only the second storm to form since the historical peak of hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies has unveiled a new supernode computing cluster that it claims delivers world-class AI performance without relying on advanced chips from Nvidia. This development represents a significant breakthrough for China's goal of technological self-sufficiency, potentially circumventing US export restrictions that have constrained its AI ambitions. At its annual conference, Huawei's rotating chairman Xu Zhijun also announced a roadmap for upgraded Ascend AI chips over the next three years. The move comes as Beijing reportedly encourages its tech firms to reduce their dependence on Nvidia's specialized chips for the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic defense pact, formalizing a deep security relationship and agreeing that an attack on one nation will be considered an act of aggression against both. The agreement was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during a state visit. This move comes as Gulf states reassess their security alliances amid regional tensions, particularly following Israel's recent attack on Qatar. The pact aims to enhance joint deterrence capabilities and marks a significant step in the long-standing partnership between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate stocks, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. Other Asian markets showed mixed results as investors processed the Fed's move, which was framed as a "risk management cut." Chip-related stocks across the region, including SK Hynix and TSMC, saw gains amid reports of China's new restrictions on Nvidia's AI chips. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy rates in its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will likely adopt a moderate monetary easing policy for the remainder of the year. The PBOC set the yuan's midpoint rate slightly lower after the Fed's announcement, and the offshore yuan strengthened against the dollar. Economists suggest that a slower pace of rate cuts by the PBOC compared to the Fed will help narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries. This strategy is expected to ease capital outflow pressures and provide support for the yuan's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>D'Anton Lynn, the defensive coordinator for USC, has stated that he has not been contacted by UCLA regarding their head coaching vacancy and that his focus remains on his current team. Lynn, who previously served as UCLA's defensive coordinator in 2023, has been widely mentioned as a potential candidate for the job after orchestrating significant defensive turnarounds at both universities. Despite acknowledging his long-term ambition to be a head coach, Lynn emphasized the importance of concentrating on the immediate task of improving USC's defense. He recently signed a lucrative contract extension with USC, making him one of the highest-paid assistants in college football.</p>

NASA confirmed the issue was resolved, attributing the shutdowns to overly conservative software safeguards, and the spacecraft is on track for capture by the station's robotic arm. The Cygnus XL is on its maiden flight and carries over 11,000 pounds of essential supplies, research materials, and spare parts for the station's crew.

The piece suggests that as China's economy and job market evolve, it is crucial for society and families to support unconventional career choices. The author contrasts this with past stories of university graduates in unconventional jobs, which were often framed as novelties rather than valid life choices.</p>

The music acts as vital information, guiding the audience's interpretation of the clothes and creating memorable, immersive experiences.

Starting with the class of 2029, students must take a foundational course in generative AI and participate in workshops focused on real-world applications of the technology. The program aims to equip graduates with essential skills for a job market where demand for AI expertise has surged dramatically. The university hopes this requirement will give its students a competitive advantage in the workforce, even as public skepticism about AI's impact on creativity persists.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for a running mate in 2024, but she ultimately decided against it, deeming the pairing "too big of a risk." Harris writes that asking America to accept a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man was a significant consideration, leading to her "mutual sadness" with Buttigieg over the decision. She instead chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a decision that this article suggests highlights a broader debate within the Democratic party about prioritizing electability versus identity politics.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume fruit with a low alcohol content, amounting to a daily intake equivalent to nearly two human cocktails. Scientists tested the figs and plum-like fruits the chimps eat, finding an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While this steady, low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the primate attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in fruits regularly consumed by wild chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has advised against scrapping the individual care plans, known as EHCPs, for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Instead, the committee calls for establishing new national minimum standards for Send support in all schools and providing more training for teachers. The recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for the Send system in England, which has been criticized as financially unsustainable. Parent campaign groups have strongly supported keeping the legally binding EHCPs, viewing them as a crucial "backstop of accountability" for ensuring children receive necessary support.</p>
