          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce the majority of newly imposed tariffs on each other's imports and temporarily suspend some reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. has decreased tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China has lowered its tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. However, both nations will retain a portion of their earlier tariffs, subject to further negotiations, and China has committed to suspending non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals, as both sides aim to establish a consultation mechanism to address mutual economic and trade concerns.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees utilizing medicinal plants in diverse ways to treat injuries, building on prior findings of self-medication through plant consumption. The study recorded instances of chimps applying plants to their own wounds and, occasionally, to others, indicating a behavioral repertoire for hygiene and treatment. Scientists analyzed footage of a young chimpanzee tending to its mother's injury and observed chimps caring for unrelated individuals, suggesting empathy. The team also studied decades of anecdotal evidence from a field station logbook, which described leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping others remove snares, with previous research identifying plants with antibacterial properties used by chimps.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which cater to the ultra-rich with personalized wealth management services, are experiencing rapid growth but are struggling to recruit and retain qualified money managers. Deloitte estimates that the number of family offices will increase to 10,720 by 2030, managing $5.4 trillion in assets; however, McKinsey projects a potential shortage of 100,000 wealth advisors by 2034. Family offices face competition from banks and private equity firms and often prioritize trust over expertise when hiring. Some families are willing to pay a salary premium to secure trusted employees, while young professionals may find family offices less appealing due to unclear corporate structures and career progression.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, ahead of a planned meeting with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia. The decision was celebrated in Damascus as a pivotal turning point for the country, which has struggled with poverty and instability since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Al-Sharaa has called for the de-listing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization and promised to protect ethnic minorities, though recent clashes have raised concerns. The sanctions had previously blocked foreign financing, including aid, from reaching Syria and were originally intended to put pressure on the dictatorship of now-ousted President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran has suggested establishing a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to dismantling its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the proposal to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, envisioning Iran enriching uranium to a low grade for civilian use in other Arab countries, with international oversight. This plan, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, would be permanent and include on-the-ground representatives, potentially from the U.S., offering greater oversight. While some see this as a new approach to break the impasse, the feasibility of such a venture involving regional rivals like Saudi Arabia and the UAE remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former Transportation Secretary under Joe Biden, suggested that Biden's decision to seek re-election in 2024 may have been a mistake. Speaking in Iowa, Buttigieg acknowledged that "with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case." He also addressed speculation about Biden's cognitive decline, stating that he found Biden to be sharp and effective during their time working together. Buttigieg's visit to Iowa has fueled speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, as he recently declined a Senate run in Michigan and has increased his media appearances.</p>

While salaries in Europe may be lower, factors such as social security, free healthcare, and tuition-free education are making these offers appealing to researchers considering leaving the United States due to the current administration's policies.</p>

The decision was influenced by letters from prison guards and their accomplishments while incarcerated, including educational courses and programs for inmates.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were granted a chance at freedom after more than 35 years in prison, as an L.A. County judge approved a request to resentence them for the murders of their parents. Judge Michael Jesic resentenced the brothers to 50 years to life, making them eligible for a parole hearing, after emotional testimony from family members who said the brothers had served enough time. Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman's arguments that the brothers had not shown sufficient remorse were dismissed, and the brothers expressed full responsibility for their actions. A parole hearing will likely be scheduled, and Gov. Gavin Newsom could also grant clemency.</p>
