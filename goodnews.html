          <p>The 2025 Kentucky Derby features 19 horses vying for the Triple Crown, with Journalism as the morning-line favorite. Trained by Michael McCarthy, Journalism hopes to bring joy to the Altadena community, which was affected by wildfires. Sovereignty and Sandman are other strong contenders. The article also discusses past winners, scratches, and the return of trainer Bob Baffert after a suspension, noting that morning-line odds don't always predict the winner, as seen with Mystik Dan's victory last year. The race promises excitement and showcases the culmination of months of preparation and competition for these talented horses.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for the center-left Labor Party after trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The election saw a resounding defeat for conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, impacted by campaign missteps and associations with Trump's policies. The New York Times article notes that younger voters are increasingly disillusioned with major parties, seeking bolder solutions to national challenges. Despite Albanese's win, it remains uncertain if his party will maintain its parliamentary majority, given the rise of independent and minor-party candidates.</p>

The Football Supporters Association supports the call for trials, while acknowledging the need for family zones where alcohol consumption would be inappropriate.
