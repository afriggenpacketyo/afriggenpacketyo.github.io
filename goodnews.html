          <p>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) introduced a significant software update featuring a new design language called Liquid Glass, impacting iPhones, Macs, and Vision Pro headsets. This marks the first major iPhone operating system redesign since 2013, with changes to the lock screen and button animations. However, the unveiling failed to impress Wall Street, with investors expressing concerns over Apple's artificial intelligence strategy compared to competitors like Google and OpenAI. Apple delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, citing the need for more development time to meet quality standards, restating its timeline for the coming year.</p>

          <p>President Trump promoted the "Trump Savings Account" initiative, a pilot program within the GOP megabill, at a White House roundtable with lawmakers and CEOs. The proposed law would deposit $1,000 into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund account for each newborn, with potential for up to $5,000 in annual contributions. These accounts would be designed to help children cover future expenses like college or a down payment on a home. Trump stated that the account will "contribute to the lifelong success of millions of newborn babies" and help families harness the strength of the economy.</p>

Experts suggest that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes.
