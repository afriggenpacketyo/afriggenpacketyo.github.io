          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally disruptive qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, while championship contender Oscar Piastri of McLaren crashed in the final session and will start seventh. The session, which lasted two hours, saw multiple drivers, including Charles Leclerc and Alex Albon, crash on the challenging street circuit, with light rain adding to the difficult conditions toward the end.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clinched their 13th consecutive playoff berth after defeating the San Francisco Giants, an achievement that coincided with the final regular-season home game for retiring pitcher Clayton Kershaw. This streak ties the New York Yankees for the second-longest in MLB history. While Kershaw did not get the win, the game marked a significant moment for the franchise legend. The Dodgers have not yet clinched the NL West division title but are focused on that as their next objective before the postseason begins.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a resident of Leicester, North Carolina, has built a new home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. John Saunby collected debris, including porch posts and kitchen floorboards, that were otherwise destined for a landfill to construct his unique house. The project, which he calls his "last hurrah" of home-building, features distinctive elements like Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk roof supports, representing a creative and resilient response to the destructive storm.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries upon her return from a concussion. Although England established an early lead, France remained competitive throughout the match, trailing by only two points at halftime. England's powerful maul and strong second-half performance ultimately sealed the win, setting up a final clash against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham stadium.</p>

Seeking a change from the U.S. school system and a high cost of living, she found a position at a private language school that also secured her housing. Living in the countryside offers a cheaper and more respectful culture compared to Tokyo, and her employer covered upfront costs like key money. Smith is documenting her experience to show an alternative, more affordable lifestyle for those considering moving abroad.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrats Propose Using Emergency Powers to Address UK Asylum Backlog</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 11:08:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, typically reserved for national emergencies like wartime, to address the country's asylum application backlog. The plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to manage the system more humanely and efficiently. The government's current goal is to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its newly acquired "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These special powers, which grant the White House veto authority over strategic decisions, were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned against the closure, the company reversed its decision, marking the first time the administration has exercised this authority to influence corporate operations directly.

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky discussed her journey of healing and reclaiming her narrative after the 1998 scandal that made her a target of global scorn. She explained that her decision to speak out in 2014 was partly inspired by the tragic suicide of Tyler Clementi, hoping she could be a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky noted the significant cultural shift since the 1990s, with younger generations and movements like #MeToo fostering greater empathy and providing the language to understand abuses of power, which has helped reframe her experience.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has raised hopes for increased stability in the relationship between the two nations. Following the discussion, which covered trade and TikTok, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a potential visit to China early next year. While both sides described the talks as constructive, analysts remain cautious, pointing to ongoing friction over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and potential U.S. tariffs related to China's purchases of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, driven by the high cost of U.S. higher education and the current political turmoil. Data shows a steady rise in U.S. students studying abroad over the past five years, with some college consultancies reporting a dramatic spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the significantly lower tuition fees overseas are the primary motivation, as they seek to avoid accumulating substantial student debt while gaining an international perspective.</p>

While UVB rays, which cause sunburn, are largely blocked by windows, UVA rays contribute to accelerated skin aging and cancer risk. The article emphasizes the importance of using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily to protect against both types of ultraviolet radiation. Consistent reapplication is also recommended for those spending extended time outdoors or near windows.</p>
