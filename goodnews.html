          <h2>Swedish Defense Firm Saab Reports Significant Profit and Sales Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:05:52 EDT</div>

          <p>Swedish defense contractor Saab announced a substantial 49% year-on-year increase in its second-quarter operating income, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's sales also grew by 30%, leading to a more than 14% surge in its share price. This performance reflects a broader trend of increased defense spending across Europe, with NATO members raising their targets and the EU proposing a larger budget for security. In response to high market demand, Saab has raised its full-year sales growth forecast, capitalizing on what its CEO described as a dramatic ramp-up in the European defense market.

          <p>American rap icon Snoop Dogg has officially become a co-owner of the Welsh soccer team Swansea City, joining the ownership group led by American businessmen Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen. The club, which currently plays in the second-tier EFL Championship, hopes the investment and Snoop's massive social media following will boost its global profile and revenue. In a statement, Snoop Dogg expressed his connection to the club's "underdog" spirit, likening it to his own story. This move follows a trend of celebrity ownership in Welsh soccer, notably Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's successful investment in Wrexham AFC.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors highlight the importance of establishing clear policies for family offices and businesses that employ family members to avoid potential conflicts and operational issues. Using the example of Sargento Foods, the article suggests implementing formal requirements, such as outside work experience and objective performance goals, to ensure family employees earn their positions. Without such structures, family businesses risk high turnover among non-family executives and difficult situations when underperforming relatives need to be managed or terminated. Establishing these professional standards helps ensure the business remains competitive and well-managed for the long term.</p>

          <p>A man and woman at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts have gone viral after their horrified reaction to being featured on the venue's "kiss cam." Instead of embracing, the pair recoiled in apparent shock, with the woman hiding her face and the man ducking out of view. Online sleuths quickly identified the man as a married CEO and the woman as his company's head of human resources, fueling widespread speculation that they were having an affair. Coldplay's singer, Chris Martin, commented from the stage that they were either having an affair or were very shy, adding to the viral moment.</p>

          <p>British luxury brand Burberry reported a 4% year-on-year sales increase in the Americas for its first fiscal quarter, offering a positive signal for its ongoing turnaround strategy. This growth, attributed to both new and existing customers, marks an improvement from previous declines and suggests the company's pivot towards its British heritage is resonating with U.S. shoppers. Overall group revenues saw a slight 1% decline, which was better than analyst forecasts. CEO Joshua Schulman noted that while the luxury sector faces headwinds like potential U.S. tariffs, the brand's efforts to broaden its appeal are showing promising early results across multiple regions.

          <p>The European Union has approved a new package of sanctions against Russia, which features a lower price cap on Russian crude oil and targets the country's banking and military-industrial sectors. The original G7 and EU price cap, set at $60 per barrel, aimed to limit Moscow's war revenue while keeping its oil on the global market. While the exact new level was not officially announced, officials indicated it would be dynamic, set just above $47 per barrel at current prices. This move is part of a broader European effort to increase pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, signaling a tougher stance on economic enforcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Blood Harmony" by Barry Mazor, aims to restore the legacy of Phil and Don Everly, the pioneering duo who bridged country music and pop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The book details their influential career, highlighting how their close-interval harmonies inspired acts like The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel. It also refutes common myths, clarifying their Midwestern upbringing and their role as songwriters, not just performers. The biography explores their career decline after the British Invasion, their struggles with addiction, and their eventual comeback with the 1968 album "Roots," a key work in the Americana genre that solidified their place in music history.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:53:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all U.K. elections, a move that would add approximately 1.5 million teenagers to the electorate. If passed by parliament, this would be the most significant expansion of the franchise since 1969. The change presents a new challenge for political parties, who will need to engage a younger demographic that primarily consumes news through social media platforms like TikTok. Analysts suggest that while the Labour Party is expected to benefit, right-wing parties like Reform UK could also find support, compelling all parties to develop more sophisticated digital and social media strategies to appeal to these new voters.</p>
