          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic secured his 100th win at Wimbledon by defeating Miomir Kecmanovic in a dominant third-round performance. This milestone places him in an elite group with only Roger Federer and Martina Navratilova to have achieved a century of victories at the All England Club. Djokovic, who won in straight sets, is now just five wins shy of Federer's record of 105. The victory keeps his pursuit of a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title alive as he advances to the fourth round, demonstrating formidable form throughout the tournament so far.</p>

          <p>Musicians LL Cool J and Jazmine Sullivan canceled their scheduled performances at the Wawa Welcome America festival in Philadelphia on the Fourth of July. Both artists announced their decision to stand in solidarity with the 10,000 striking city workers who walked off the job to demand better pay and benefits. In a video statement, LL Cool J said he could not in good conscience cross a picket line while people are fighting for a living wage. Philadelphia-native Sullivan echoed the sentiment, stating she chose to protest in support of the city's working class until a fair agreement is reached.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of July Market Trends for Small Trucking Carriers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 15:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A volatile July market presented significant challenges for small trucking carriers, including fluctuating rates, tight capacity, and spiking diesel prices. Successful carriers were those who focused on local or regional lanes, strengthened relationships with brokers and shippers during downtime, and prioritized driver safety coaching to maintain good CSA scores. In contrast, carriers who struggled often reacted to market conditions by taking unprofitable loads, ignored safety, and failed to budget for fuel price swings. The analysis suggests that disciplined planning and a focus on operational efficiency are key to navigating the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain, born Samuel Clemens, sought to reconnect with his past as a steamboat pilot, a profession he considered the peak of personal freedom. The passage describes his mixed feelings of nostalgia and disappointment as he witnessed the changes to the landscape and the decline of the steamboat era. Despite the transformations, Twain felt profoundly at home in the pilot house, reflecting on it as a cherished, carefree period of his life.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography is being published 100 years after his death, revealing his uncensored thoughts on his life and times. The work was not written but dictated over four years, resulting in a non-linear, blog-style collection of memories, opinions, and stories. Twain specified the century-long embargo to speak freely about his contemporaries without causing immediate hurt, offering sharp critiques of figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw reflections on his family. This posthumous release offers an unfiltered look into the mind of one of America's most iconic literary figures.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris anticipates a highly competitive British Grand Prix, suggesting that six cars from three different teams have a realistic chance of winning. After qualifying third behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen and his teammate Oscar Piastri, Norris noted the close competition, with Mercedes and Ferrari also showing strong pace. The top teams have adopted different aerodynamic strategies, with Red Bull opting for higher straight-line speed while Ferrari and McLaren are configured for better cornering performance. This strategic diversity, combined with a tight qualifying session, sets the stage for a potentially thrilling and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is in a commanding position to win the second Test against England, largely thanks to a brilliant century from captain Shubman Gill. Following his first-innings 269, Gill scored 161 in the second, allowing India to declare and set England a near-impossible target of 608 runs for victory. By the close of day four, England's top order had crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 with Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, and Joe Root all dismissed. With India's bowlers finding success with the new ball, England faces the daunting task of surviving the final day to secure a draw and maintain their series lead.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-brokered proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Israel, stating it is ready to enter negotiations on the implementation details. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week. While Israel has reportedly supported the terms, it has not yet officially committed, with a delegation expected to travel to Qatar for further talks. Hamas is seeking guarantees for a total end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza following the initial truce.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation has always been divided, and the founders created a system out of that turmoil, which should provide optimism for today's polarized climate. Burns argued for embracing the complexity and flaws of historical figures like Thomas Jefferson, stating that understanding their contradictions makes their achievements more inspiring. He believes that a deeper, more complicated telling of history allows everyone to find a connection to the nation's story.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Potential Economic Impact of Taxing Billionaires at Middle-Class Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the U.S. tax system highlights the disparity between how wealth growth and traditional income are taxed, explaining why billionaires often have a lower effective tax rate on their overall fortune. The "buy-borrow-die" strategy allows the ultra-wealthy to live off loans against their appreciating assets, deferring or avoiding taxes that wage earners pay immediately. Taxing billionaires' wealth growth at rates comparable to middle-class income could generate hundreds of billions in additional annual revenue for the government. This could potentially fund major public initiatives in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared on the "Call Her Daddy" podcast that she consciously chose to be a single mother, a decision supported by relationship experts. Theron explained that her choice stemmed from her experiences with a tumultuous family dynamic involving alcoholism and her own tendency to lose herself in relationships with narcissistic partners. By being honest with herself about her capabilities, she decided against having children with a partner. Experts praise her decision as a sign of strength and self-awareness, noting that for many women today, partnership is a preference rather than a necessity for stability or family-building.</p>
