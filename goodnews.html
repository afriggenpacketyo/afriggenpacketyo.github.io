          <p>Levita Almuete Ferrer, a former State Department budget analyst, pleaded guilty to stealing more than $650,000 from the agency over two years. Ferrer abused her signature authority over a State Department checking account, writing 60 checks to herself and three to an acquaintance. She attempted to conceal the scheme by falsifying entries in a Quickbooks account, changing payees to legitimate State Department vendors after printing the checks. Ferrer faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and has agreed to pay full restitution to the U.S. government. Optimism that the State Department's internal controls will be improved as a result of the case are middling.</p>
