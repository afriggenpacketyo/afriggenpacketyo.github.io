          <p>China has announced an 18-point plan to upgrade its IT manufacturing sector, aiming for self-sufficiency in key technologies like semiconductors, AI, and satellite navigation, while also circumventing US tech restrictions. By 2027, the plan targets deeper AI integration and the development of specialized service providers, with over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes. By 2030, China intends to establish a core industrial database to facilitate breakthroughs and advance its IT manufacturers to the high end of the global value chain, solidifying its industrial system. This initiative, released by multiple government bodies, marks the closing phase of the ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù plan.</p>

Daniel Schneemann's three-run homer narrowed the gap, but the Dodgers widened their lead with additional runs and a three-run homer from Max Muncy. Dustin May earned the win, while Tanner Bibee took the loss, as Ohtani finished with one hit, two RBIs, and two walks.</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets firms producing 100,000 tons of CO2 or more annually, covering industries like steel and car production, and accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding this limit from those with a surplus. While incentivizing emissions reduction, the system may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>Global makers of surveillance gear are clashing with Indian regulators over new security rules requiring manufacturers to submit hardware, software, and source code for assessment in government labs. This policy is driven by India's alarm over China's surveillance capabilities and the need to ensure the security of CCTV cameras. The new requirements have sparked industry warnings of supply disruptions and added to disputes between the Modi administration and foreign companies. While the Indian government says the policy addresses a genuine security issue, companies are concerned about insufficient testing capacity and scrutiny of sensitive source code.</p>

Circle, profitable with $64.8 million in net income in the latest quarter, did not provide a reason for this decision, but it likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns.

          <p>A judge struck down President Trump's executive order targeting WilmerHale, marking another victory for law firms resisting the administration's pressure. Judge Richard J. Leon ruled the order unconstitutional, stating Trump intended to drive the firm to the bargaining table with severe sanctions. WilmerHale, along with other firms, sued to stop the executive orders, arguing they infringed on the legal profession's independence. Other firms that sought to appease Trump have faced internal discord and resignations.</p>
