          <p>This article discusses whether prospective borrowers should rush to open a home equity line of credit (HELOC) before the May Federal Reserve meeting. It notes that HELOCs have variable interest rates that adjust monthly, so locking in a low rate isn't urgent. The article suggests HELOCs are currently the cheapest borrowing option and a smart way to finance home projects, potentially becoming even cheaper with future rate cuts. It advises researching lenders and rate offers but cautions careful borrowing due to the home serving as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boaz Barak, a computer science professor at Harvard University, argues that universities should prioritize professionalism and scholarship over activism to restore public trust in higher education. He recounts his experience organizing a vigil for victims of the Hamas attack and refusing to grant leniency to students involved in campus activism. Barak believes that eroding the boundaries between academic and political spheres harms both, contributing to a decline in public confidence in universities. He emphasizes the importance of collaboration and objective truth in education to cultivate better citizens, warning against the intrusion of ideology.</p>

          <p>Two planes, a Delta Air Lines flight and a Republic Airways flight, were instructed to perform "go-arounds" at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) to avoid a military helicopter. This incident occurred less than a month after the FAA increased staffing and oversight at DCA following a deadly midair collision in January. The FAA had previously restricted non-essential helicopter operations and prohibited simultaneous use of certain runways when helicopters are operating near DCA. The article raises questions about how this incident took place given the new guidelines, and officials are evaluating arrival rates at DCA.</p>

          <p>Former White House national security advisor Mike Waltz and other Trump officials are reportedly using a modified version of the Signal app for communication, despite concerns about its security. A photo shows Waltz using an app that appears to be a TeleMessage "fork" of Signal, which adds archiving capabilities. While the White House claims Signal is an approved app, a Signal spokesperson stated they cannot guarantee the privacy or security of unofficial versions. This follows a previous controversy where Waltz inadvertently included a journalist in a Signal thread discussing pending military strikes.</p>

          <p>Netflix stock is trading at all-time high levels, marking an unprecedented 11-day win streak. This surge follows a strong earnings report with 13% revenue growth driven by subscriptions and advertising. Netflix has been a top performer in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, unaffected by tariffs and perceived as recession-resilient. Traditional media stocks have struggled, while Netflix forecasts continued revenue growth. Despite subscription price hikes, Netflix retains value, although the company has stopped reporting membership numbers.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's sell-off, fueled by hopes for trade talks, but the economic impact of President Trump's policies remains a concern for investors. The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent on Friday, recovering to pre-tariff levels, supported by a strong jobs report. However, the index is still below its February high, and companies are struggling to forecast future earnings due to trade policy uncertainty. While some tariffs have been paused, new taxes on imports, including auto parts, are expected to take effect, potentially slowing economic growth and raising consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz (BfV), has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist after a three-year investigation. The BfV concluded that the AfD's actions contradict the constitution's fundamental principles. While several state-level AfD branches had already been labeled extremist, this extends the designation to the party's national organization. Despite capturing over 20% of the vote in recent elections, the AfD remains politically isolated, with mainstream parties shunning any governing coalition roles.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment (NCA) report, two scientific associations are calling for research submissions to sustain the momentum of the next report. The American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) aim to fill the gap created by the administration's actions. The NCA is a comprehensive report on the impacts of climate change in the United States, and its models are used to estimate future impacts.
