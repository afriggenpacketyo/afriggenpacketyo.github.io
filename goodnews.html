          <p>Leading technology companies including OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, and Cisco are partnering to develop Stargate, a large-scale artificial intelligence campus in the United Arab Emirates. The project, in collaboration with Emirati firm G42, will span 10 square miles with a 5-gigawatt capacity. OpenAI and Oracle will manage a 1-gigawatt compute cluster, utilizing Nvidia chips for processing and Cisco Systems for connectivity infrastructure. An initial 200-megawatt AI cluster is expected to be operational next year, marking a significant step in the UAE's ambitious AI development plans.</p>

          <p>The English government has approved a 4% pay raise for most doctors and teachers, accepting recommendations from pay review bodies, which exceeds the initially budgeted 2.8%. While education unions have generally welcomed the decision, they have cautioned about potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding. Health unions, however, have expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, including nurses, with junior doctors receiving a slightly higher average increase of 5.4% due to a top-up. The British Medical Association plans to ballot members regarding possible strike action in response to what they consider an inadequate rise.</p>

          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy startup, priced its IPO at $32 per share, the high end of its expected range, raising approximately $273 million. The company, founded in 2014, will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "HNGE." Hinge Health's IPO is being closely watched by the digital health sector, which has seen few public offerings since 2021. Revenue in the first quarter increased by 50%, with the company reporting a net income of $17.1 million, signaling a potential turnaround for the digital health market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000, up from the current $10,000 limit established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The increased cap would phase out over $500,000 and go into effect in 2025, with annual 1% increases from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially diminishing the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The proposal may face challenges in the Senate before it can be enacted.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill includes a provision for "Trump Accounts," providing a $1,000 baby bonus to eligible families. Similar to a 529 college savings plan, earnings in these accounts grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While these accounts offer a tax incentive for early saving, existing options like custodial brokerage accounts and 529 plans already provide similar benefits. Experts suggest that 529 plans may be superior for those focused on higher education due to federal tax-free growth and the potential to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's previous suggestion, a tax break on Social Security benefits is unlikely to be included in the Republican-backed tax legislation due to reconciliation process limitations. Instead, the House bill proposes an "enhanced deduction for seniors," providing an extra $4,000 deduction for filers 65 and older, available to both itemizers and those taking the standard deduction. This deduction is effective starting in 2025 but expires in 2029, with an income threshold of $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for married couples. Eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the long-term outlook of the program and Medicare.</p>

The US has paused higher tariffs until July, but a base levy of 10% remains in place against a list of countries.

However, seniors should approach gold investments cautiously due to the current high prices and the potential for a pullback. Gold does not generate income like dividends or interest, which may not suit seniors seeking regular cash flow. Lower-cost options, such as fractional gold investing and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), can make it easier for seniors to invest in gold.</p>
