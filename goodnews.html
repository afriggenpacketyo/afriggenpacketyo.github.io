          <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker Ted Hui has been granted asylum in Australia, along with visas for his family members. Hui fled Hong Kong in 2020 after facing criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists targeted with a police bounty in 2023. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government but also conveyed the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He urged Australia to increase its efforts to help other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned.</p>

          <h2>A Personal Reflection on How Life Experience Unlocks the Emotional Power of Renaissance Art</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 03:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author reflects on a personal journey from dismissing Renaissance art in their youth to deeply connecting with it as an adult, particularly after experiencing trauma and motherhood. Initially finding the religious art unrelatable, life events allowed for a new appreciation of the emotional complexity in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Raphael. The article connects this evolution to a broader theme of shedding youthful cynicism and embracing earnestness. This newfound perspective helps the author understand the profound connection local communities have to historical art, seeing it not just as a masterpiece but as a protector of life and a vessel for shared human experience.</p>

          <p>Arsenal enters the new season with heightened expectations of winning the Premier League for the first time in 21 years after a £190 million investment in new players. Manager Mikel Arteta has focused on strengthening the team's spine with key signings like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres. The club has also emphasized increasing squad depth to ensure consistent performance and has adopted a more direct, faster-paced attacking style during pre-season. With a squad largely composed of players entering their peak years, the pressure is on Arteta to deliver a major trophy after three consecutive second-place finishes.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf successfully obtained a DNA sample from a long-sought murder suspect through an undercover meeting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, was a person of interest in the brutal murders of two women in the early 1990s. During the staged meeting, detectives ensured Miller used a glass, which was later collected and tested. The DNA from the glass was a perfect match to evidence found at the crime scenes, leading to Miller's immediate arrest. Miller, known locally for his 'Zombie Hunter' persona, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is currently hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery. The exhibition, featuring dozens of oil paintings and sketches, is curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness," tracing his life and career in St Petersburg and the Gulf of Finland. This framing comes after Ukraine's Ministry of Culture declared in January that Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine, is part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition underscores the close cultural ties between Beijing and Moscow amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant that has been a celebrity hotspot for six decades, has died at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Born in the former Yugoslavia, Tana was a professional soccer player before opening his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining destination for stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Known for its red-and-white-checkered tablecloths and classic red-sauce dishes, the establishment became an L.A. institution. Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, but it has endured under new ownership, maintaining its old-world charm and reputation for discreetly serving Hollywood's elite.</p>

          <h2>Longstanding '85th Percentile' Rule for Setting U.S. Speed Limits Faces Reevaluation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decades-old traffic engineering guideline known as the 85th percentile rule, which sets speed limits based on the speed of the fastest 15% of drivers, is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. Critics argue the rule creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding drivers cause speed limits to be raised, even in urban and residential areas. Amid a spike in road deaths, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors, like pedestrian safety and crash frequency, should also be considered. Cities like Madison, Wisconsin, are now proactively lowering residential speed limits to improve safety, challenging the traditional car-centric approach.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop New Technique for Creating Transparent 3D Organ Images</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:15 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that produces highly vivid and accurate three-dimensional images of organs by making the tissue transparent. The technique preserves the integrity of the organ's biological structures while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. According to the scientists, the process creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that is extremely clear and maintains its original shape. This glassy solid state also allows for the long-term storage of the prepared samples, offering a significant advancement for biological and medical imaging.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic mistakes by their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the NL West. The Padres' sloppy play included three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. Dodgers starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered six shutout innings against his former team, while a two-run error by the Padres' center fielder and multiple walks allowed the Dodgers to build an early and insurmountable lead. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, giving them a crucial tiebreaker advantage.</p>
