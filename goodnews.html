          <h2>Phoenix Fire Department Adopts Low-Tech Ice Immersion Method to Combat Deadly Heatstroke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:08:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst extreme heatwaves, the Phoenix Fire Department is successfully using a simple, low-tech solution to save lives from heatstroke. The method involves immersing victims in a large bag filled with ice and water to rapidly lower their core body temperature, a technique originally developed by the military. This cold water immersion is three to five times faster than traditional methods and has proven effective, contributing to a drop in heat-related deaths despite record temperatures. The city has now stocked ice at all fire stations and popular trailheads to make the life-saving treatment more accessible.</p>

          <p>According to former player and analyst Francisco 'Kikín' Fonseca, the upcoming Leagues Cup presents a crucial opportunity for the struggling LA Galaxy. The team is currently last in the MLS standings and faces fan protests over the club's silence on recent ICE raids, which has created a tense atmosphere. Fonseca argues that strong on-field performances and positive results in the tournament could help mend the relationship with their alienated fanbase. While acknowledging the tough competition, he believes a dedicated effort could restore trust and confidence, even if he doesn't see them as title contenders.</p>

          <h2>Accelerated Medical School Programs Aim to Alleviate Growing Physician Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 19:43:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat a projected shortage of up to 40,000 primary care physicians by 2036, medical schools are increasingly offering accelerated three-year MD programs. These fast-track options, available at 33 schools, allow students focused on general medicine to enter their residencies a year earlier. Proponents argue this model produces competent physicians more quickly, saves students a year of tuition, and encourages graduates to practice in underserved communities. Studies have found no significant difference in knowledge or performance between graduates of three- and four-year programs, emphasizing lifelong learning in the medical field.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a resolution supporting the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) amid concerns it could be disbanded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The independent panel of medical experts provides evidence-based recommendations for crucial preventive care, such as cancer screenings and heart disease prevention, which insurers are required to cover without co-pays under the ACA. The resolution aims to ensure the task force can continue its work without political interference. Lawmakers and health experts worry that disrupting the panel could undermine public health and lead to recommendations not based on science.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, the Los Angeles Zoo is home to Tasmanian devils, welcoming two males named Danny Zuko and Crush. The animals arrived from the Aussie Ark conservation organization in Australia and are now on view in the Animals of Australia exhibit. Tasmanian devils, indigenous only to the island of Tasmania, are an endangered species primarily threatened by a contagious facial tumor disease. Known for their powerful bite and noisy feeding habits, their arrival is a significant event for the zoo's conservation and public education efforts.</p>

The role, which dates back to 1675, has evolved from navigational advising to serving as one of the country's most important scientific voices on the world stage.</p>

          <p>While acknowledging Figma's strong product and impressive financials, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to be cautious about the design software company's upcoming initial public offering. He noted that the company is already valued at a high level, and a significant price jump after trading begins could make the stock too expensive. Cramer also raised concerns about CEO Dylan Field's comments that heavy investment in AI could negatively impact profitability for several years. The broader enterprise software sector has also shown recent weakness, adding another layer of risk for potential investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of New Orleans has introduced the "Crescent City ID," a municipal identification program designed to help residents who face barriers to obtaining standard IDs, including migrants and the homeless. The program is seen as a supportive measure for the city's immigrant communities as the Trump administration continues to target sanctuary jurisdictions. The ID, which also allows for self-identified gender markers, will provide proof of identity and access to city services. To protect applicants, officials stated the program will store minimal personal information, a concern highlighted after a similar program in Chicago was subpoenaed by ICE.</p>

According to sources, the orders include 20 Eurofighter jets, up to 3,000 Boxer armored vehicles, and as many as 3,500 Patria infantry fighting vehicles, with a combined estimated cost of over 20 billion euros. This military overhaul is financed by an increase in the defense budget and aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. and enhance European security.

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, consuming it in excess can lead to some negative side effects, according to health experts. As a high "FODMAP" food, it can cause digestive issues like bloating and gas for some individuals, particularly those with irritable bowel syndrome. Its high level of the amino acid tyramine can also trigger migraines in susceptible people. Furthermore, due to its natural sugar content, people with diabetes are advised to moderate their intake to avoid significant impacts on their blood sugar levels.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic humorously criticizes a new congressional bill aimed at prohibiting "weather modification."

Suggestions include outlawing children singing "Rain, rain, go away," the actions of Punxsutawney Phil, and characters like Thor and Storm from X-Men. The satire highlights the absurdity of legislators focusing on conspiracy theories rather than addressing scientifically established issues like climate change, which the author cheekily includes as a final item to be banned.</p>
