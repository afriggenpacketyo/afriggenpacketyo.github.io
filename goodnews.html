          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung advocates for a deal with Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure." Lee views this as a feasible, realistic alternative to immediate denuclearization, given North Korea's current rate of producing 15-20 nuclear weapons annually. He seeks to reduce tensions and believes mutual trust between Trump and Kim could facilitate renewed talks. The article highlights Lee's pragmatic approach to navigating complex international relations and domestic political challenges, aiming for regional peace and security despite North Korea's past rejections of goodwill gestures.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg criticized the UK government's deference to US President Donald Trump as "cringey," urging Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to assert British values more firmly. Clegg, recently returning from a seven-year stint at Meta, also supported Liberal Democrat proposals for health warnings on social media apps and a two-hour daily limit for children, citing growing concerns over youth mental health. The article details his view that the UK faces an unavoidable choice between the US and the EU, and his strong condemnation of Elon Musk's recent comments as an "outrageous intrusion" into British sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, increasing annual flights to 389,000 and passenger numbers to 80 million by the late 2030s. While welcomed by the government and some for job creation, the expansion faces strong opposition from climate campaigners and the Green Party, who warn of increased air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. The article details the measures Gatwick agreed to, including stricter noise controls and public transport targets.</p>

          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe proposes "re-engineering" the global calendar for Olympic sports, especially endurance events, in response to growing climate change challenges. After the Tokyo World Athletics Championships saw athletes contend with extreme heat and humidity, Coe noted that 70% of athletes report climate impacts on their training. He suggests events like marathons might need separate scheduling at different times of the year to protect athletes and maintain performance standards. The article emphasizes the inevitability of adapting the international calendar, given perceived governmental inaction on climate change, to ensure the sport's future and athlete safety.</p>
