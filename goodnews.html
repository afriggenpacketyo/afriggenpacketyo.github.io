        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has significantly bolstered its air defense capabilities with the deployment of a new US-made Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) system, marking the first known instance of such a system at an overseas US base. This advanced mobile, ground-based weapon is specifically engineered to effectively counter a wide range of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and rockets, artillery, and mortars. The strategic move is widely interpreted as a direct response to escalating security concerns stemming from China and North Korea, aiming to enhance regional deterrence and stability. Its introduction follows earlier reports indicating the US Army's intent to evaluate new prototype air and missile defense technologies in global hotspots, reinforcing a commitment to allied security.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 23:57:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American malls and a national rise in shopping center vacancy rates are inadvertently fostering new opportunities for small, independent businesses to access prime commercial real estate. While asking rents continue to increase, the pace of this growth has significantly slowed to around 2% annually, coupled with increased availability, creating a more flexible market. This shift enables a diverse array of local enterprises, including health practitioners, yoga instructors, and gourmet food businesses, to negotiate more favorable lease terms like shorter durations or rent-free periods, often in locations previously dominated by large chains. This trend, however, varies by geography and is balanced by landlords' inherent caution regarding the high failure rate among small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, with the mainland CSI 300 index climbing about 16% and its Information Technology Index reaching 2015 highs, driven by progress in artificial intelligence, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and Beijing's campaign to curb price wars. This surge is largely fueled by retail investors, who account for 90% of daily trading volume, shifting their record-high household savings into equities amid falling deposit rates. While some experts, like Standard Chartered's Raymond Cheng, note a disconnect from economic fundamentals, others, such as Lotus Asset Management's Hao Hong, warn that pockets of the market are "a little too hot," suggesting it is not yet a bubble but heading in that direction, especially in sectors like contract research organizations and technology.

The 79-year-old performer revealed in an Instagram post that her doctor advised her to undergo "a few procedures," though she did not disclose specific details. Parton, who recently experienced the loss of her husband, maintained a good-spirited tone, jokingly referring to it as her "100,000-mile check-up." She assured her fans that while she wouldn't be able to rehearse for the Vegas show, she would continue working on other projects from Nashville, prioritizing being at her best for future performances.</p>

          <p>The Phoenix Mercury staged a remarkable comeback, overcoming a 68-55 deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx 86-81 in Game 4 of their semifinal series, securing their spot in the WNBA Finals. Alyssa Thomas delivered a stellar performance with 23 points and 10 assists, while DeWanna Bonner was instrumental, scoring 11 of her 13 points and hitting all three of her 3-pointers in the decisive final period. The Lynx were significantly hampered, playing without their star center Napheesa Collier, who suffered a left ankle injury, and with associate head coach Eric Thibault filling in for suspended head coach Cheryl Reeve. Phoenix will now compete in the best-of-seven WNBA Finals for the first time since 2021, aiming for their first championship since 2014.</p>

          <p>The karearea, New Zealand's only native falcon, has been crowned the winner of the country's annual Bird of the Year competition, attracting over 75,000 votes from 123 countries. This apex predator, known for its incredible speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, faces significant threats from habitat loss and predation, with official figures estimating only 5,000 to 8,000 individuals remaining. The popular contest, despite its playful nature, serves a crucial role in raising public awareness about New Zealand's unique and highly endangered bird species, 80% of which face varying levels of threat. Conservationists emphasize that public awareness is a powerful tool against habitat destruction, climate change, and introduced predators, urging increased government investment in conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group soared 36% on its market debut Monday, following its spin-off from parent company Sony Group, valuing the new entity at over $6.7 billion. The separation allows the financial arm, which encompasses Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank, to independently raise its own growth capital while maintaining crucial brand ties with the wider Sony ecosystem. Sony Group cited competing investment demands in its entertainment and semiconductor divisions as a key rationale for the financial unit to operate autonomously. While broader Asian markets traded mostly higher, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices experienced slight declines after hitting a record high on Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article delves into the concept of "energy vampires" in friendships—individuals who tend to drain one's emotional and mental energy through various behaviors. Psychologists and journalists identify common signs such as excessive complaining, constant self-focus without reciprocal interest, and a persistent need for attention or reassurance. These individuals may also subtly chip away at one's mood through backhanded compliments or by not allowing genuine emotional expression. To manage such draining relationships, experts recommend honest communication about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent or topics discussed, and trying alternative activities together. If the friend is unwilling to change, prioritizing one's own well-being by limiting exposure becomes crucial.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambitious goals for adopting green marine fuels are critically dependent on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, President of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already achieved liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling operations with significant throughput, it needs to work diligently to facilitate the tax-free import, storage, and sale of mainland-produced green methanol. This statement was made at the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, billed as the world’s first large-vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. CM Energy anticipates gradually increasing its green methanol usage from 2027, driven by Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariff regime, despite the current cost being around four times higher than traditional fuel.
