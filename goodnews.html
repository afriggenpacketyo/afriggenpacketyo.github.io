The process begins with a comprehensive review of all debts, income, and expenses to understand the full financial picture and determine eligibility. It is also crucial to understand how different programs, like debt settlement or consolidation, will impact personal finances, including credit scores and potential tax liabilities. Finally, creating a realistic budget and pausing all new credit activity are vital preparations for successfully navigating the program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a lower-than-expected inflation report and signs of a cooling labor market, economists widely anticipate that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its next meeting. President Trump has continued to publicly pressure the central bank for lower rates, though the Fed maintains its independence from political influence. Despite concerns about potential inflation from tariffs, the recent economic data appears to give policymakers the justification needed to reduce borrowing costs to prevent a potential economic slowdown.

          <p>Small-cap stocks saw a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, as investors shifted away from large technology companies. This market rotation is fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, a move that would particularly benefit smaller companies reliant on borrowing for growth. While the broader S&P 500 saw modest gains, the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks experienced a slight decline, signaling a potential shift in investor strategy toward more economically sensitive sectors.
