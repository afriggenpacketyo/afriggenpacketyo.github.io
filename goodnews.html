          <p>Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams has been ruled out of the remainder of the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia due to a hamstring injury. The injury occurred during the Lions' decisive 54-7 victory over Western Force in Perth, where Williams had scored a try before being forced to leave the field. Lions tour manager Ieuan Evans expressed sadness over the departure of Williams, who he described as an "exemplary Lion." Scotland's Ben White has been called up to join the squad as his replacement, leaving flanker Jac Morgan as the only Welsh player remaining on the tour.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could potentially "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to fixture congestion. While acknowledging the financial benefits and prestige of the tournament, he admitted to feeling anxious about the physical toll on his players, who will have minimal rest. Guardiola's comments echo similar sentiments from other top managers like J√ºrgen Klopp, who have criticized the relentless schedule. Despite the concerns, Guardiola stated his team will follow the rules set by football's governing bodies and focus on competing to win the tournament while managing player recovery.</p>

          <p>The search for the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, a marsupial predator declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. Enthusiasts use trail cameras and forensic techniques to find evidence, driven by a deep-seated hope that the creature still roams the island's dense outback. In a separate scientific effort, a de-extinction project backed by $15 million in funding is working to resurrect the thylacine. Researchers at the University of Melbourne aim to edit the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart, to recreate the extinct animal's genome, though some scientists remain skeptical of the project's feasibility.</p>

Chinese customs authorities announced the conditional resumption of imports, stating that long-term monitoring and independent sampling showed no abnormalities in the discharged water. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve diplomatic and economic ties with Japan amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States.

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise could feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel stated that bringing back the beloved character was one of his conditions for agreeing to a 2027 release date for the finale. Walker passed away in 2013 during the filming of "Furious 7," and his role was completed using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. The potential return of his character raises questions about the use of digital recreation for deceased actors, a practice that remains a topic of debate.</p>
