          <p>With credit card balances rising, experts recommend several strategies for users to manage their debt effectively. Using cash and debit cards more frequently can help curb overspending and reliance on credit. Exploring debt consolidation options, such as balance transfer cards or personal loans, can lower interest rates and accelerate debt repayment. Speaking with a debt relief service provider can provide personalized solutions for managing high balances, including credit counseling and debt management programs. These steps can help individuals regain financial independence and improve their credit card usage habits. (not investment advice)</p>
