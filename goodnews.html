          <p>Ten individuals accused of robbing Kim Kardashian of $10 million worth of jewelry in 2016 are awaiting a verdict in Paris, with prosecutors seeking 10-year sentences for the main perpetrators. Kardashian testified emotionally about the ordeal, stating she feared for her life during the armed robbery. Two of the accused, whose DNA was found at the scene, apologized to Kardashian and the court. The gang, dubbed "the Grandpa Robbers," faces charges including robbery and kidnapping for the brazen heist that occurred during Paris Fashion Week.</p>

          <p>An international study led by the University of Edinburgh refutes the theory that COVID-19 originated in a Wuhan lab, instead tracing the virus to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. Researchers analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes, determining that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic emerged. This finding contradicts claims by the White House that a Chinese lab leak was the 'real source' of the pandemic, providing evidence that supports a natural origin.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that clownfish are shrinking in size in response to severe ocean heat waves, a phenomenon observed during a 2023 event off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Scientists found that individual fish got shorter by a few millimeters over weeks, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. The study suggests that being smaller may help clownfish better cope with energy requirements in a warmer climate, with the fish that shrank having a higher chance of survival, adding a layer of complexity to the otherwise dire consequences of climate change on coral reefs.</p>
