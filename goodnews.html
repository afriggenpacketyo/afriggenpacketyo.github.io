          <h2>Chinese Open-Source AI Models Challenge Dominance of US Tech Giants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 22:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are gaining global traction by developing powerful open-source artificial intelligence models, presenting a significant challenge to closed-system US counterparts like OpenAI and Google. Unlike some US firms that restrict access in China, these Chinese models are freely available to developers worldwide, fostering a collaborative global AI community. This open-source movement is not only spurring a wave of AI applications within China but is also reshaping the global AI landscape. Analysts suggest this trend poses a more serious challenge to proprietary US systems than previous open-source software did.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly," as the administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The statement was made during a White House dinner with Republican senators. This development is part of a proposed truce that includes the return of live hostages and the remains of others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid ongoing, Qatar-mediated indirect talks and follows a recent White House visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive. During intense fighting, a music box from his sister inspired him to imagine a peaceful carousel in a mountain meadow, an image that provided solace. After struggling with PTSD for years, Harrison decided to make his vision a reality, buying and restoring a broken-down carousel over 26 years in Nederland, Colorado. Now a nonprofit, the "Carousel of Happiness" has brought joy to over a million people and provided its creator with profound healing.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bipartisan legislation establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Supporters believe the law will enable banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, facilitating faster and cheaper transactions while strengthening the dollar's role in digital finance. This move is seen as a major step toward integrating digital currency into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that the global financial system must adapt its rules to address the challenges posed by a tokenized future, particularly the rise of stablecoins. The BIS, known as the "central bank of central banks," highlighted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of stablecoins complicates efforts like anti-money laundering. This call for regulatory evolution comes as the market for private digital currencies expands, driven by events like the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle and a more favorable U.S. political climate.

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, rose more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced the company will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally as index funds must purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing influence of technology companies within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as "benign and common" in older adults, occurs when leg veins struggle to send blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. A full medical evaluation, including an ultrasound, confirmed the diagnosis and ruled out more serious issues like blood clots. Doctors recommend managing CVI with lifestyle changes like compression and exercise, and they affirmed that the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city on California farmland, has announced its next phase: a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. The proposed "Solano Foundry" aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, framed the plan as restoring the "designed in California, made in California" model.

Microsoft's Chief Communications Officer confirmed the change, stating the company is committed to ensuring the security of its services for the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer, a trend pest control experts attribute to the very warm and dry spring weather. While many dislike the insects, experts like Professor Seirian Sumner emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers. The common wasp appears to be thriving, bucking the trend of decline seen in many other global insect populations. To coexist peacefully, experts advise against swatting at wasps and suggest distracting them with a small amount of something sweet placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new comedic stage show, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has opened in Liverpool, reimagining the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy epic akin to "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play is a humorous and affectionate homage inspired by a tabloid myth about Coleen's engagement ring. The show portrays the famous couple as heroic fantasy characters, aiming for silly, over-the-top fun rather than pointed satire. It is a homegrown comedy typical of the city's Royal Court theatre.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's vaccination program for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) will be extended this autumn to include premature babies.

RSV is a highly infectious virus that is a leading cause of hospitalization in a child's first year. Health officials stated the new vaccine, which offers around 80% protection, will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and reduce pressure on hospitals.</p>

          <p>A remarkable story from 2005 is being remembered, recounting how a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was seemingly rescued by a pride of lions after being kidnapped. The girl was abducted by seven men who intended to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports at the time, three lions chased the men away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found. Wildlife experts speculated that the girl's whimpering may have resembled the sound of a lion cub, preventing the animals from attacking her. The incident is still regarded by many as a miracle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has uncovered a specific interaction between a common gene variant and gut bacteria that may trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. Researchers found that in individuals with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system's "brake" fails, causing it to overreact to a molecule produced by harmless gut bacteria. This overactivation of a protein called STING leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The discovery helps explain the disease's unpredictable nature and opens the door to developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway.</p>

A senior U.S. official stated the deal would not have been possible without Bukele's cooperation and confirmed that no U.S. nationals remain in Venezuelan custody.
