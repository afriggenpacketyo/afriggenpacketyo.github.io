          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu faced another major setback, losing to Sebastian Fundora in a seventh-round TKO during their highly anticipated world-title rematch in Las Vegas. This defeat marks Tszyu's third in his last four fights, following an impressive 24-bout unbeaten start to his professional career. Fundora, a significantly taller opponent, dominated early, dropping Tszyu in the opening round and causing a severe cut above his right eye in the second. Despite Tszyu's valiant efforts and some effective body shots, he was unable to continue, prompting discussions about his next career move, potentially to a different weight class.</p>

          <h2>Missing Persons Count in Texas Floods Significantly Reduced to Three</h2>

          <p>Officials in hard-hit Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant positive development regarding the deadly July 4 floods, with the number of missing persons dropping from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by over 1,000 local, state, and federal authorities who tirelessly verified the safety of many initially unaccounted for individuals. While the overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, including 107 in Kerr County, this news brings considerable relief. Three people remain missing in Travis County and one in Burnet County.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin recently surged to a new all-time high of $117,500, pushing 99.85% of Bitcoin addresses into profit, marking a rare and historically significant milestone. This widespread profitability underscores Bitcoin's remarkable ability to generate wealth for investors across various time horizons, validating its long-term thesis. The current surge is largely driven by increasing institutional adoption and consistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating a fundamentally different market structure compared to previous cycles. However, historically, extreme profitability readings like this can signal either the beginning of a sustained breakout phase or a temporary market peak before a period of consolidation.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to introduce a powerful new crime aimed at individuals preparing mass killings, ensuring their plotting is treated with the same seriousness as terrorism. This initiative seeks to "close the gap" in existing legislation, which currently requires an ideological motive for severe charges like preparing for acts of terrorism. The proposal follows incidents like the Southport attack, where a perpetrator murdered three girls without a clear ideological link, limiting early intervention powers. The new law would empower police to apprehend violence-obsessed individuals much earlier, enhancing public safety measures.</p>

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made the unusual decision to give Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, just one game into the second half of the season, as the superstar shortstop's career-worst slump continues. Betts' batting average has fallen to .241, and his OPS to .688, indicating a significant and prolonged decline in his offensive production. Roberts observed Betts' visible frustration and the lack of improvement from before the break, prompting the decision to remove him from the lineup.

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry experienced a midair prop malfunction during her "The Lifetimes Tour" concert in San Francisco, California. While performing her hit song "Roar" atop a mechanical butterfly, the prop unexpectedly dropped several feet, visibly startling the singer mid-chorus. Perry, however, quickly recomposed herself and continued the performance, later humorously remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song ended. This incident, which occurred without injury, underscores the inherent technical challenges and potential risks associated with elaborate stage productions that suspend artists in the air, similar to a recent malfunction on Beyoncé's tour.</p>

          <p>A significant debate is intensifying in the UK regarding the optimal length of summer school holidays, with proponents advocating for shorter breaks to potentially benefit pupils' learning and alleviate childcare challenges for working parents. While England, Wales, and Scotland traditionally have six-week summer breaks, some academies have already adopted a five-week model with extended half-terms. Supporters argue this could reduce "holiday hunger" and narrow the learning gap, especially for disadvantaged children. However, teachers' unions express concerns about burnout, and some parents worry about increased holiday costs due to compressed demand, highlighting complex social, economic, and educational considerations in this ongoing discussion.</p>

However, financial experts caution against forcing this shift, particularly in volatile markets, and emphasize the critical need for improved financial understanding and tailored approaches, especially to encourage more women to invest.

          <p>India's burgeoning economy is fostering a new generation of wealthy individuals, leading to the emergence of modern, members-only clubs that cater to their distinct needs, a departure from traditional Raj-era gymkhanas. International chains like Soho House are expanding rapidly, recognizing a strong demand for exclusive spaces where "new wealth" entrepreneurs and creators can network and access diverse communities. Unlike older clubs, these new establishments prioritize personal accomplishment and future potential over family legacy, attracting a self-made elite. While offering unique opportunities and a more democratic ethos, these clubs remain highly exclusive due to prohibitive membership costs, largely inaccessible to the average middle-class Indian.</p>
