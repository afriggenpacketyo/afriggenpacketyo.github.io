          <p>Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the reality TV show ‚ÄúDuck Dynasty‚Äù and founder of the Duck Commander business, has died at the age of 79. Robertson, who had early-stage Alzheimer's and other health problems, created the duck-call business that became a reality television empire for his family. ‚ÄúDuck Dynasty,‚Äù which ran for 11 seasons, centered on the Duck Commander business and the family's unique brand of humor. The show occasionally courted controversy, including a brief suspension of Robertson after he made statements that were widely seen as offensive to gay people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing the 'first sale rule,' a decades-old piece of legislation, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a transaction, potentially stripping out the cost associated with a middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. The first sale rule is considered particularly useful in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, where margins are greater.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming, the 'Su Hai No 1,' in June, signaling a push to reduce reliance on imported seafood through offshore aquaculture. The vessel, costing 600 million yuan (US$83.6 million), is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional systems, the ship can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security amidst global challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep enables the brain to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research reveals how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to 'repair mode,' prompting restorative slumber. This discovery offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases, opening pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

The bomber crashed off New Guinea in 1944, killing all 11 aboard, and was initially deemed non-recoverable. The effort to locate the crash site was initiated by a relative of one of the crew members, leading to the discovery of the wreckage and the subsequent recovery of remains and personal artifacts.

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to reach approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the auction system and involves major retailers, such as supermarkets, to enhance government influence over prices. The decision follows criticism of the government's ineffectiveness in curbing rising rice prices amid broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice, covering transportation costs to regional areas, with online sales also under consideration.</p>
