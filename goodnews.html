          <p>Steel stocks saw a boost after President Trump doubled tariffs on steel imports, increasing them from 25% to 50% to further secure the United States' steel industry. Cleveland-Cliffs shares rose by approximately 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor each experienced increases of over 10%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw a rise of 1.9% following Trump's announcement at a Pennsylvania rally, which has reignited trade tensions and faced criticism from global partners. This tariff increase is aimed at strengthening the domestic steel industry. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>A lesser-known treatment called Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) claims to treat PTSD painlessly, offering an alternative to prolonged exposure therapy. RTM involves patients reimagining their trauma through mental exercises designed to fade its emotional charge, utilizing a manualized 89-step protocol. Early data from a large-scale clinical trial suggests RTM modestly outperforms prolonged exposure, with a higher completion rate and lower PTSD severity scores. While critics note the need for more research, RTM's potential lies in its gentler approach and quick treatment duration. Optimism score is 60.</p>
