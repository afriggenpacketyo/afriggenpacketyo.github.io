          <p>The United States has disclosed additional information regarding its sixth-generation fighter jet, intensifying its competition with China for dominance in future aerial warfare. General David Allvin, the US Air Force chief of staff, shared an infographic revealing details of the F-47 fighter jet and its collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) drones, developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The F-47 will have a combat radius exceeding 1,000 nautical miles, surpassing the F-22 Raptor. The accompanying CCA drones, YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A, will have a combat radius of over 700 nautical miles, and are critical for operations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, is experiencing a significant increase in overseas visitors, attributed to the country's expanded visa-free entry policies and integration of the Greater Bay Area. The city's international airport has recorded over 152,000 visa-free entries by foreign nationals in 2025, a 160.3% year-on-year surge. To meet the rising demand, a direct flight to Dubai is scheduled to start in July, with multiple international routes added to cities like Vientiane, Osaka, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Hanoi. Shenzhen is appealing to travelers due to its status as a trade and manufacturing center, its proximity to Hong Kong, and its relatively low cost of living.</p>

Like PSG, Inter Miami struggles to balance its star-studded forward line with the rest of the team, leading to defensive vulnerabilities. Coach Mascherano acknowledged his responsibility for the team's poor performances, emphasizing the need for tactical improvements and greater player commitment. While Inter Miami still has the potential to contend for the Supporters' Shield, their success will be judged on trophies won, with Messi potentially facing a similar fate to his time at PSG, where he failed to win the Champions League.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential impact of President Donald Trump's policies on the renewable energy sector in the US. Trump has expressed his disdain for wind power and halted permits for onshore wind energy projects, while also considering tariffs that could affect the clean energy industry. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, the sector faces uncertainty due to Trump's policies, which could slow down growth and increase costs for renewable energy projects. The article suggests that clean energy will continue to grow but at a slower pace.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie pledged to address Britain's 'crisis of trust' by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie outlined measures to allow the BBC to play a leading role in reversing a breakdown in trust in information and institutions, combating division and disconnection between people. Proposed measures include using artificial intelligence "for good" in its Bitesize educational service and calling for a national plan to switch off traditional broadcast transmissions in the 2030s for internet-only delivery of programmes.</p>
