        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation at the University of Oxford, globalisation is not dead but is instead flourishing and becoming more centered in Asia. He asserts that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while the process is becoming more fragmented and regional, with the U.S. partially withdrawing, Asia's continued success demonstrates its vitality. The professor also warns that the risks of globalisation, such as pandemics, are growing alongside its benefits.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz delivered a dominant performance to win his second US Open title, defeating rival and defending champion Jannik Sinner in four sets. The victory returns the 22-year-old to the world No. 1 ranking and marks his sixth career Grand Slam title, making him the second-youngest man in the Open era to achieve this feat. The article highlights Alcaraz's versatile and commanding gameplay, which kept Sinner off balance throughout the match. The event was also notable for the logistical disruptions and heightened security caused by the attendance of President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attendance at the U.S. Open men's final generated a mix of applause and boos from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The article notes that while critics focused on the negative reception, there were also audible cheers for the president. It also reports that the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) issued a directive to broadcasters, asking them to refrain from showcasing any crowd disruptions in response to his presence. The USTA stated this is a regular practice to avoid focusing on off-court events during a match.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as Hong Kong shows clear signs of economic revival, it must act swiftly to cement its unique international standing. The city's bustling tourism and event schedules, along with a resurgent IPO market, signal a return to form after years of restrictions and political uncertainty. The author suggests Hong Kong is benefiting from its distinct status as a capitalist hub within China, allowing it to host events unimaginable on the mainland. The piece concludes that the city must find a balance between integrating with China's economy and preserving its global financial identity.</p>

          <p>Much of California is experiencing unseasonably cool weather, with temperatures dropping 5 to 15 degrees below normal for early September. The forecast includes thick marine fog, chilly breezes, and the possibility of light showers along the coast, a stark contrast to the typical heat waves that follow Labor Day. While Los Angeles residents may welcome the relief, Bay Area locals are facing more cold after an already chilly summer. This unusual weather pattern is attributed to an upper-level low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific Ocean.</p>

          <p>Sky-gazers across the globe have been treated to a total lunar eclipse, a celestial event popularly known as a "Blood Moon." This striking phenomenon occurs when the Moon passes directly through the Earth's shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a reddish hue. The light from the sun is filtered through Earth's atmosphere, scattering blue light and allowing red light to pass through and illuminate the lunar surface. The captivating display was visible in its totality from numerous countries, offering a spectacular sight in the night sky.</p>
