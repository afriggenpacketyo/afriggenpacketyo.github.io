          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university alleging First Amendment and due process violations. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and fostered an unsafe environment for Jewish students, while Harvard President Alan Gerber stated the university did respond as required. The lawsuit accuses the administration of retaliatory attacks due to policy disagreements, impacting over 7,000 international students. This is the latest development in the administration's standoff with Harvard over campus policies and funding.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of all scheduled concerts up to early July 2026 due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition causing problems with hearing, vision, and balance. The iconic singer, 76, was advised by his doctor to undergo physical therapy and refrain from performing during this recovery period. NPH, which involves a buildup of spinal fluid in the brain, is relatively uncommon but usually treatable with a shunt to drain the fluid, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in women with dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound, and can find smaller tumors than regular mammography. While MRI is also effective, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely available. The study, conducted across 10 sites in the United Kingdom, involved over 9,000 women and found that contrast-enhanced mammography detected 19.2 cancers per 1,000 exams, compared to 4.2 with ultrasound. The FDA has not approved contrast-enhanced mammography for screening.</p>

Some view it as a vital community hub that must be preserved, while others see it as a reminder of a tragic event that hinders progress. This disagreement has led to a standstill in the city's plans for the area, with proposals for an open street and a pedestrian mall both facing opposition.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily allowing President Trump to fire certain federal officials but signaled it would not extend this authority to members of the Federal Reserve. This decision suggests the Court recognizes the importance of the Fed's independence in setting interest rates based on economic calculations, not political considerations. The order stems from a case challenging the president's power to fire officials at independent agencies, reflecting a broader debate about the "unitary executive" theory. The ruling indicates a potential limit to presidential control over previously independent parts of the federal government.</p>
