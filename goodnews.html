          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere has announced it will screen the 1939 classic "The Wizard of Oz" as its first-ever immersive film experience, starting August 28. The project will utilize the venue's massive 16K wraparound screen, with engineers using AI to expand the original film frames to fit the unique space. The experience aims to place viewers inside the movie's world, enhanced by a spatial audio system with 167,000 speakers and 4D effects like haptic seating, wind, and fog. This marks a new venture for the high-tech entertainment venue.</p>

          <h2>England's Lucy Bronze Played Through Euro 2025 with a Fractured Tibia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 12:09:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following England's victory in the Euro 2025 final, defender Lucy Bronze revealed she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia. Medical experts suggest the injury was likely a stress or fatigue fracture of the shin bone, rather than a complete break, which would have made playing impossible. The 33-year-old started all six games for the Lionesses, playing nearly 600 minutes. Her ability to perform at an elite level despite the injury has been called "remarkable" and is seen as a testament to her mental resilience and the skill of England's medical staff.</p>

          <p>Recent changes to airport security protocols, such as ending the universal "shoes off" policy, have led travelers to question the value of paid services like TSA PreCheck. However, travel industry experts suggest that frequent flyers may still find significant benefits in these programs. While some perks are now more widespread, memberships still offer access to shorter, dedicated screening lines, which can lead to a less stressful travel experience. The decision to enroll often depends on an individual's travel frequency and whether they can get the membership fee covered by a credit card.</p>

          <p>A Swiss study has found that the human immune system may react to the mere visual suggestion of an infection. Researchers used virtual reality to show participants avatars of human faces, some of which appeared sick with a cough or rash. Blood samples taken afterward showed increased activity of specific immune cells, indicating the brain had triggered an immune response without any actual exposure to a pathogen. The findings suggest a powerful link between visual perception and immunology, which could open new therapeutic avenues for modulating the immune system.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has sold a portion of its shares in the industrial manufacturer Eaton, as the stock reached another record high. The article explains the move as a profit-taking strategy, capitalizing on the stock's 20% year-to-date gain, which was recently boosted by the US-EU trade deal. The rationale is to lock in a significant gain and reallocate the capital into other industrial stocks that have lagged but show strong potential. The sale will realize a gain of approximately 75% on shares purchased in late 2023. (not investment advice)</p>
