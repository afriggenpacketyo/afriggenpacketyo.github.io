        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the Model Y. Despite facing declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. However, overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year, and Tesla faces increased competition, especially from Chinese EV makers like BYD, and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk. While the Australian rebound is encouraging, it does not necessarily indicate a broader global recovery for Tesla.</p>
