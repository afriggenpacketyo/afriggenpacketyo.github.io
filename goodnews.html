          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted further construction at a controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, known as 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The ruling responds to a lawsuit from conservation groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the project violates environmental laws by threatening fragile wetlands and sacred lands. While the facility can continue to hold detainees, the two-week restraining order prevents any new paving or infrastructure work while the court considers the case's environmental claims.</p>

          <p>A recipe for the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe on the popular UK website Good Food has caused widespread anger in Italy for its departure from tradition. The recipe included non-traditional ingredients like parmesan and butter, and even suggested adding double cream, while misrepresenting the famously challenging dish as a quick meal. The controversy escalated to the point where an Italian restaurant association lodged a complaint with the British embassy in Rome to defend the authentic three-ingredient recipe.</p>

          <p>In a victory for environmental advocates, the California Supreme Court has ruled that a legal challenge against the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives can proceed. The unanimous decision sends the case back to an appeals court, which had previously deferred to the Public Utilities Commission's (PUC) expertise. The lawsuit, filed by three environmental groups, argues that the PUC violated state law in 2022 when it drastically reduced the value of credits homeowners receive for sending surplus solar power to the grid.</p>

          <p>The sequel "Freakier Friday" reunites Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan for another body-swap comedy, this time involving a four-way switch with their respective grandmother and daughter characters. According to this review, the film's primary appeal is the chemistry between its original stars, as the plot itself feels rushed and lacks the emotional weight of the 2003 movie. While enjoyable for fans, the movie is framed as a serviceable but ultimately disposable comedy that relies more on hijinks and cameos than on a compelling story.</p>
