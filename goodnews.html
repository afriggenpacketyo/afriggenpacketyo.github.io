          <p>For the second time in a week, a WNBA game was interrupted when a spectator threw a sex toy onto the court. The incident occurred during a matchup between the Golden State Valkyries and the Chicago Sky, prompting officials to halt play to remove the object. Following the event, Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham urged fans on social media to stop the practice, citing potential injury to players. This follows a similar disruption during a game between the Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream just days earlier.</p>

          <p>Marc Maron's latest HBO Max special, "Panicked," continues his recent trend of blending personal anxieties with commentary on catastrophic current events like climate change and political decay. The article reviews the special as the third in a loose trilogy, noting Maron's controlled, narrative-driven style that explores themes of domestic and societal "shittiness." It highlights a segment on potential childhood sexual trauma, which Maron uses not for pity but to explore how others process inflicting abuse. The review concludes that Maron's comedy remains consistent in its vulnerability and self-excavation, even as his temperament has softened over the years.</p>

The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is now weathertight and will be dedicated solely to international travelers, featuring a light-filled design and 23 gates upon final completion in 2030. The project is part of a wider $19 billion overhaul of JFK aimed at modernizing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic.

          <p>Álvaro Uribe, the former president of Colombia, has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery. The historic verdict follows a trial where prosecutors provided evidence that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who had accused him of having links to paramilitary groups in the 1990s. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, has denied the charges and plans to appeal. The ruling is a significant moment for Colombia, as Uribe remains a polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country but condemned by others for human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from Special Counsel John Durham's report weakens claims by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard of a "treasonous conspiracy" by the Obama administration to undermine Donald Trump. The document concludes that emails used to support the conspiracy theory, purportedly from a Clinton aide and a George Soros-funded foundation, were likely a composite created by Russian intelligence hackers. This finding contradicts the narrative that the FBI and other agencies manufactured intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The disclosure adds to a body of evidence affirming Russia's role in the election interference.</p>

          <p>The Australian Wallabies secured a 22-12 victory over the British and Irish Lions in a dramatic and physically intense final Test match in Sydney, preventing a series whitewash. Played in torrential rain, the game was marred by injuries and a 40-minute suspension due to lightning. The Wallabies dominated much of the contest, outscoring the Lions three tries to two, with standout performances from players like Will Skelton and Taniela Tupou. Despite the Lions having already won the series, the result was a significant morale boost for an Australian team showing signs of a revival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, young people in India are reconnecting with spirituality, but on their own terms. India's Gen Z is shown to believe religion is important, often using it as a coping mechanism for mental health and to find solace in a chaotic world. This new approach is less about traditional rituals and more about personalized experiences, engaging with spiritual content online, and visiting religious sites for a sense of peace. This trend is also influenced by the current political climate and the promotion of Hinduism by the government, as well as by relatable spiritual influencers on social media.</p>

          <p>The article details the story of Amber Meade, who developed debilitating pain after a foot surgery, a condition that took nearly a year to be diagnosed as chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is a rare, incurable disorder that can occur after an injury, causing extreme pain disproportionate to the original event. Meade's journey highlights the difficulty in diagnosing the condition and the multi-pronged treatment approach required, which for her includes specialized physical therapy and ketamine infusions. While still managing the lifelong condition, she has regained significant functionality and hopes her story raises awareness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court in D.C. has limited President Trump's sweeping order to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border. The panel of judges ruled that the administration cannot use the proclamation to ignore U.S. laws that bar the deportation of migrants to countries where they would face persecution or torture. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying discretionary asylum, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be available to migrants. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by the ACLU challenging the legality of the president's January proclamation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how federal agents can conduct "roving" immigration raids in Southern California. The decision affirms that agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like a person's race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, as such actions violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The case was brought after a series of high-profile raids in the Los Angeles area in June, which advocates argued were unconstitutional racial profiling. The ruling is a victory for immigrant rights groups challenging the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics.</p>

The move comes after Equinix's stock price dropped following an announcement of higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). Elliott, which has extensive experience in the data center sector, likely sees long-term value in Equinix's expansion to meet growing demand from AI and hyperscalers. The article suggests Elliott could push for improved market communication, cost optimization, and financial engineering to amplify shareholder returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Southwest Airlines moves to an assigned seating model, the value of paying for early boarding upgrades becomes a key consideration for more travelers. According to travel experts, the primary reason to purchase an early boarding pass is to guarantee space for a carry-on suitcase in the overhead bins. With bins often filling up before the final boarding groups, those who board late risk having to check their bags at the gate. Other ways to secure an earlier boarding position include holding an airline's co-branded credit card or booking a more expensive premium economy fare.</p>

          <p>Following Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders' surgery for bladder cancer, surgeons explain the procedure he underwent, known as neobladder reconstruction. The operation involves removing the cancerous bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. This allows the body to avoid rejecting the new organ. While the procedure is a major advancement, patients must retrain themselves to use the bathroom as the neobladder cannot signal the brain when it is full. Sanders has spoken openly about the challenges, including incontinence, to reduce stigma for others.</p>
