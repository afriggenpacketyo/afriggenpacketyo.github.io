          <p>Rental car company Hertz is enhancing its e-commerce platform to allow customers to handle nearly the entire used car purchasing process online, including financing and trade-ins. This strategic move aims to improve the company's retail sales channel, which is its largest for offloading its fleet of around 560,000 vehicles. By modernizing its sales approach and maximizing resale prices, Hertz hopes to accelerate its fleet turnover and bolster its financial recovery following its 2020 bankruptcy.

          <p>Amid a shortage of affordable human therapists, a growing number of people are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for mental health support. Users report benefits such as 24/7 availability and a lack of judgment, finding them helpful for managing anxiety and even rehearsing difficult conversations. However, bioethicists and psychiatrists warn of significant risks, including the potential for false intimacy, emotional dependency, and a lack of ethical oversight or privacy protections. Experts stress the urgent need for regulation to ensure these AI tools are used safely, especially for vulnerable individuals and minors.</p>

          <p>CNBC is now accepting nominations for its 2026 Changemakers list, which honors women who are transforming business and philanthropy. The initiative aims to highlight female leaders at a time when recent data shows a decline in female representation on S&P 500 boards and in leadership teams for the first time in years. This trend is particularly noticeable among newly public companies, where female leadership is even more scarce. The call for nominations underscores the importance of recognizing women who are innovating and driving change despite persistent gender gaps in corporate America.</p>

          <p>An author reflects on their journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew," an identity based on stereotypes and vague social justice ideas, to discovering the depth and intellectual richness of Jewish tradition. Initially embarrassed by Judaism's laws and perceived dogma, a decade of study revealed a tradition rooted in debate, questioning, and diverse conceptions of God. The author argues that this superficial understanding of Judaism is a product of centuries of anti-Semitism and assimilationist pressures. Reclaiming a deeper knowledge of Jewish history and texts is presented as a powerful way to combat modern anti-Semitism and live a more authentic Jewish life.</p>

          <p>Qatar has affirmed its readiness to continue mediating an end to the Gaza war after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret for a September 9 air strike in Doha. The strike, which targeted Hamas leaders, unintentionally killed a Qatari security officer and violated Qatar's sovereignty. In a trilateral call with U.S. President Trump, Netanyahu assured Qatar's prime minister that such an attack would not happen again, a move that appears to have de-escalated the diplomatic crisis. The incident had initially drawn a furious reaction from Qatar, a key U.S. ally and host of the Hamas political bureau.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent wave of countries like Britain, Canada, and Australia recognizing a Palestinian state is more than just a symbolic gesture, as it directly challenges the Israeli settler right's goal of permanently preventing Palestinian sovereignty. While these declarations do not change the immediate reality on the ground in Gaza or the West Bank, they establish a framework for future international political action. This global commitment to a two-state solution signals that the world may not accept Israel's attempts to create "facts on the ground" through settlement expansion as a final resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The popular image of college students as fragile "snowflakes" intolerant of free speech is a misconception, argues Princeton's president in a new essay. He contends that while a few high-profile disruptions receive disproportionate media attention, the vast majority of students are eager to engage in constructive debate. The author criticizes flawed free-speech rankings that mistake controversy for censorship and silence for freedom. He suggests the biggest challenge on campus is not overt censorship but self-censorship due to peer pressure, a problem reflecting broader societal polarization rather than a unique issue with today's youth.</p>

          <p>Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington argues that society suffers from a "collective delusion" that equates overwork and burnout with success. Drawing from her personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she emphasizes that scientific evidence shows people are more effective and creative when they prioritize rest and recharging. Huffington advocates for a cultural shift away from celebrating constant work, particularly for young professionals. She promotes the concept of "micro steps"—small, incremental daily changes that build healthier habits and lead to more sustainable and genuine success.</p>
