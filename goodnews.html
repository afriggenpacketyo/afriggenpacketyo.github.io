          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck early Saturday near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region, with its epicenter located 111.7 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. Initially, the Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a brief threat warning, but this was quickly downgraded to no tsunami threat. There were no immediate reports of injuries or significant damages following the seismic event. This region had previously experienced a series of strong quakes in July 2025, with one also registering 7.4 magnitude.</p>

          <p>Three elderly Austrian nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps after being moved to a care home against their will in December 2023. With the help of former students and a locksmith, Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita re-entered the abandoned building, despite the disapproval of church authorities who claim the convent rooms are unsuitable for their care. The nuns, who spent decades teaching at the attached school, assert their right to live out their lives in their cherished home. Supporters are now providing them with food and medical assistance.</p>

          <p>An analysis highlights Charlie Kirk's significant influence in mobilizing younger voters, particularly young men, which contributed to Donald Trump's 2024 election victory. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, focused on social media outreach and community engagement, persuading an older generation of Republicans to invest in youth voter initiatives. Experts note Kirk's ability to project strength and masculinity resonated with young men, even among those who disagreed with his politics. This strategic outreach helped Trump improve his performance with the under-30 demographic, a group traditionally dominated by Democrats, especially in key swing states.</p>
