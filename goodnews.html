          <p>The Senate has confirmed Sam Brown, an Army veteran who was severely injured in Afghanistan, to serve as the Veteran's Affairs undersecretary for memorial affairs. In this role, Brown will oversee the National Cemetery Administration, which is responsible for maintaining over 150 national cemeteries and providing burials for veterans. The confirmation passed with a 54-44 vote, with two Democratic senators from Nevada joining Republicans in support. The vote occurred amid broader partisan tensions, with Republicans accusing Democrats of deliberately slowing down the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees.</p>

          <p>High-level trade negotiations between the United States and China have concluded with both nations describing the talks as "constructive" and agreeing to continue efforts to extend a 90-day tariff truce. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that any final decision to prolong the truce, which is set to expire in August, must be made by President Donald Trump. The discussions covered economic issues, rare earths, and China's relations with Russia and Iran. Without an extension, tariffs exchanged between the two economic powers earlier in the year could be reinstated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Singapore's Central Bank Holds Monetary Policy Steady Amid Forecasts of Economic Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:35:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's central bank has maintained its current monetary policy, anticipating a moderation in economic growth for the second half of 2025. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expressed concern over global trade uncertainties, particularly potential changes in U.S. tariff rates, which could impact the nation's heavily export-dependent economy. Despite strong GDP growth in the second quarter that helped it avoid a technical recession, the MAS cited geopolitical risks and financial volatility as significant threats. The decision follows remarks from a Singaporean official that the U.S. was "non-committal" regarding tariff levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Sexual Assault Charity to Launch Separate Support Service for Biological Women</h2>

          <p>A sexual assault support charity in Brighton, UK, has announced it will create a new service exclusively for biological women, following a dispute over the inclusion of transgender women in its support groups. The decision comes after a woman, known as "Sarah," initiated legal action against Survivors' Network, stating she felt uncomfortable discussing her trauma in a group that included a trans woman. The charity and Sarah have reached an agreement before the case went to trial, resulting in the new 12-month pilot program. This new group will operate alongside the charity's existing, inclusive sessions that remain open to trans and non-binary individuals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a 51-47 party-line vote. Monarez, who holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor, previously served as the acting head of the agency. During her confirmation hearing, she was questioned about her views on public health issues, particularly in relation to her superior, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Monarez affirmed that she has seen no causal link between vaccines and autism and stated her belief that fluoridated water is safe, positioning herself to lead the agency with a focus on science and evidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As extreme temperatures persist, the Phoenix Fire Department is using a low-tech but highly effective method to save lives from heatstroke: cold water immersion. The technique involves placing victims with dangerously high core temperatures into a large plastic bag filled with ice and water to cool them rapidly. This method, originally developed by the military, is reported to be three to five times faster than traditional cooling techniques, potentially preventing organ failure and brain damage. With heat-related deaths in Phoenix dropping last year despite record temperatures, the ice bag protocol is being hailed as a critical and simple tool in urban emergency response.</p>

          <p>According to former soccer player and current analyst Francisco 'Kikín' Fonseca, the ongoing Leagues Cup tournament presents a crucial opportunity for the LA Galaxy to mend its relationship with its fanbase. The team has had a difficult 2025 season, sitting last in the MLS standings and facing fan protests over the club's silence on ICE raids affecting the Latino community. Fonseca believes that strong performances and dedication on the field are the only way for the team to reverse the current negative atmosphere and regain the trust of its supporters. The Galaxy is set to play against three Mexican teams in the tournament's group stage.</p>

          <p>Senators Angus King and Elizabeth Warren have introduced a resolution to support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) amid reports that Health Secretary Robert F.

The USPSTF is an independent panel of medical experts whose evidence-based recommendations guide free preventive care coverage, such as cancer screenings and heart disease prevention, under the Affordable Care Act. The resolution recognizes the task force's crucial work and calls for it to continue without political disruption.

          <p>An ophthalmologist is issuing a strong warning against the common habit of sleeping with contact lenses, describing it as a "game of Russian roulette" for your vision. Dr. Amanda Redfern explains that this practice, which includes even short naps, can trap bacteria and lead to a corneal ulcer, a severe infection that can cause permanent scarring or even vision loss. She advises against any activity where lenses are exposed to nonsterile conditions, including showering or using tap water for rinsing or storage. For overall eye safety, she also emphasizes the importance of wearing protective eyewear during household projects to prevent traumatic injuries.</p>

The planned procurements are said to include 20 Eurofighter jets, up to 3,000 Boxer armored vehicles, and as many as 3,500 Patria infantry fighting vehicles. This spending push is part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's goal to build Europe's most powerful conventional army and meet NATO's new defense spending benchmark. The move aims to bolster European security and reduce reliance on the United States, following years of acknowledged neglect of Germany's military readiness. (not investment advice)</p>

The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Additionally, because of its natural sugar content, people with diabetes are advised to eat it in moderation to avoid significant impacts on their blood sugar levels, though dietitians note it is difficult to eat a harmful amount.</p>
