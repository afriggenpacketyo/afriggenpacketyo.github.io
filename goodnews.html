          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled several US concerts due to recovering from the flu, ahead of his scheduled performance at the Glastonbury Festival later this month. The cancellations include four dates in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, with another two shows in California being rescheduled. Stewart, who is set to play the legends slot at Glastonbury, expressed his apologies to fans for any inconvenience caused. He had previously mentioned plans to scale back large-scale world tours after 2025 in favor of more intimate venues, but remains enthusiastic about his upcoming Glastonbury performance where he will be joined by former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. The singer is scheduled to play for an hour and a quarter on the Pyramid Stage and has requested an additional 15 minutes. The rockstar is expected to make a full recovery. His performance will be a Sunday teatime slot. The score is based on the fact that he is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has granted final approval to a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay athletes. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion for former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. Payouts will be determined by sport and career length, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each. The agreement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, and it also calls for a clearinghouse to ensure that NIL deals are pegged at fair market value. The article highlights the end of amateurism and the beginning of direct payment to athletes, as well as the regulation of NIL deals. The settlement provides a positive change for college athletes.</p>

          <p>Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life requires more than individual optimization through diet and exercise. Public health policies, infrastructure, and community play a significant role in determining health outcomes and longevity. The focus on personal responsibility distracts from the impact of public policy and community in affecting our health chances and longevity. The author suggests supporting policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water. The focus on collective responsibility is important.</p>
