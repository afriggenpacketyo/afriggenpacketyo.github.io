          <p>Sources indicate that former U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China in the autumn, although a potential September trip is no longer being considered. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange a visit for October or November, possibly in conjunction with the APEC summit in South Korea. This potential high-level engagement follows what was described as a positive meeting between the top diplomats of both nations. The discussions suggest a continued effort to maintain dialogue and manage the complex relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A Russian woman, Irina Krynina, has founded a project in Ukraine called "Our Way Out" to help relatives of Russian prisoners of war connect with their captured family members. After her own partner was captured fighting for Russia, Krynina moved to Kyiv and began visiting prison camps, recording interviews, and facilitating communication. Her initiative aims to provide proof of life to families in Russia, where captured soldiers are often officially listed as missing or deceased. Despite facing mixed reactions, Krynina's work also serves to inform Russians about the realities of the war.</p>

          <h2>China Announces Global AI Action Plan Amidst Intensifying Tech Competition with US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:54:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a global action plan for artificial intelligence, emphasizing international cooperation just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang proposed a global AI cooperation organization and highlighted the country's "AI plus" plan to integrate the technology across industries. This move is seen as intensifying the tech race, with analysts suggesting the formation of two distinct camps: a multilateral approach led by China and a U.S.-led bloc with its allies. China aims to extend its technological assistance, particularly to nations in the Global South.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for former U.S. President Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Turnberry golf resort. The visit includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, prompting road closures and a heavy police and military presence. While some protests have occurred in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, the atmosphere around the resort remains controlled. The visit has also drawn attention to the Scottish government's recent funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses in the country.</p>

          <h2>Justin Bieber's New Album 'Swag' Offers a Soothing Soundtrack for a Tense Summer</h2>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being seen by critics as a potential savior for a summer music season lacking a definitive upbeat anthem. The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production that reflects a more reserved and melancholic cultural mood. The lead single, "Daisies," has already reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and its success suggests listeners are responding to its gentle and stable tone. This article suggests the album's downtempo yet detailed sound is resonating in a year marked by widespread anxiety.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a novel public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes modified with Wolbachia bacteria to combat the spread of dengue fever. This bacteria prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, effectively stopping its transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói demonstrated remarkable success, reducing dengue cases by approximately 90% and significantly lowering instances of Zika and chikungunya. The Brazilian government is now investing heavily in this strategy, opening a new factory capable of producing billions of these "good mosquitoes" annually.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, Christopher Kennedy, has received a new lease on life after a successful double-lung transplant for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal disease discovered incidentally during a pre-surgery X-ray. Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy was resistant to the idea of a transplant but eventually agreed and was placed on the national waiting list. After his condition severely deteriorated, he received the transplant at Cleveland Clinic and has since made a strong recovery, with his lung capacity now at 98%. He is now training a new therapy dog named Encore to celebrate his second chance.</p>

          <p>Despite being the highest-paid actor in Hollywood during the 1930s, Will Rogers' primary passion was being a cowboy, not a movie star, according to his great-granddaughter. Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry states that Rogers viewed his film career, which included over 70 movies, as a means to fund his preferred lifestyle of traveling, ranching, and connecting with ordinary people. He maintained his identity as a "common man" from Oklahoma, never losing touch with his roots even as he gained global fame as an actor, columnist, and author. His sudden death in a 1935 plane crash was a major event that deeply affected people worldwide.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale effort to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall election was initiated by civic groups following legislative moves that critics argued favored Beijing and undermined the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's government. The outcome means the KMT and its allies will retain their majority in the legislature, signaling continued political challenges for President Lai Ching-te's administration. Another seven KMT lawmakers will face a similar recall vote in August.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the life of Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at age 76, celebrating his journey from a troubled youth to a global music icon and unlikely television star. It highlights his role as a founding member of Black Sabbath, a band that pioneered heavy metal, and his subsequent, even more successful solo career. The piece acknowledges his notorious struggles with addiction and reckless behavior but also points to his reinvention as a beloved, bumbling father on the reality show "The Osbournes."

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, veteran closer Kenley Jansen, currently with the Anaheim Angels, could be a candidate for a trade back to his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers are in need of right-handed relief pitching, and Jansen is having a strong season, converting 17 of 18 save opportunities. While Jansen expressed a desire to help the Angels win, the team's poor performance makes trading pending free agents for prospects a logical move. Jansen stated he would be willing to pitch in any role for a contending team to pursue another World Series ring.</p>

          <p>In a significant government reshuffle, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appointed Yulia Svyrydenko as the country's new prime minister, a rare instance of a woman leading a former Soviet state. The 39-year-old Svyrydenko, who previously served as deputy prime minister, faces the immense tasks of managing a wartime economy and securing international support. Her appointment has been met with some skepticism and sexist criticism, with some observers questioning her independence from Zelensky. However, her supporters point to her extensive experience in negotiating international trade and investment deals as a key asset for Ukraine's future.</p>
