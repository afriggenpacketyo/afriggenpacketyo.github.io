          <p>Coffee giant Nescafé is shifting its focus to attract younger consumers, specifically Gen Z, by tapping into the rapidly growing cold coffee market. The company acknowledges that iced coffee is often the entry point for this demographic and is developing new products like its Espresso Concentrate to meet this demand. This strategy is part of a broader effort by parent company Nestlé to refocus on core, high-growth categories like coffee to improve its market performance. Nescafé also sees an opportunity to position coffee as a sophisticated, non-alcoholic alternative for evening social occasions among younger adults.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial therapists and consumer experts are advising people to be more intentional with their spending by asking critical questions before making a purchase. They suggest evaluating one's emotional state, such as whether a purchase is driven by hunger, anger, or loneliness, rather than genuine need. The article recommends creating a dedicated budget for non-essential items to avoid dipping into funds for necessities or savings. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of researching products, avoiding impulse buys to impress others, and walking away if the desired item isn't exactly what you want, promoting a more mindful and financially healthy approach to shopping.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being celebrated as a landmark moment for Muslim and South Asian American communities. His rise is seen as challenging long-held assumptions about who can represent a city like New York, energizing voters with a platform focused on affordability and Palestinian rights. Despite facing Islamophobic smears, Mamdani's campaign successfully mobilized a diverse coalition, including working-class South Asian and Indo-Caribbean groups. His success reflects a broader trend of these communities building political power and advocating for candidates who reflect their values, moving beyond simple identity politics to demand substantive policy changes.</p>

          <h2>US Safety Board Calls Media Speculation on Air India Crash Cause 'Premature'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued a statement cautioning that media reports about the cause of the fatal Air India Dreamliner crash are 'premature and speculative.' This warning comes after India's initial accident report raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches, leading to widespread media theories, including potential pilot error or suicide. The NTSB emphasized that complex investigations into major aviation disasters take a significant amount of time to complete. Indian authorities and pilot federations have also condemned the reports as irresponsible, urging the public to await the final, official findings.</p>

          <p>British MMA fighter Dakota Ditcheva, the first British woman to win a PFL world title, has voiced her frustration over the difficulty in finding challengers following her dominant 2024 season. After securing four decisive victories, including three first-round stoppages, the 26-year-old flyweight has been on an eight-month hiatus as the promotion struggled to find a worthy opponent. Ditcheva feels her momentum has stalled but is now set to face American Sumiko Inaba in Cape Town, South Africa. She hopes her return to the cage will reignite the excitement surrounding her career after the extended and difficult wait.</p>

          <p>Following a poor showing at the Club World Cup, Los Angeles FC is looking to regain favor with its fans by securing a victory in the highly anticipated derby against archrival LA Galaxy. Despite a recent string of three consecutive MLS wins, the team and its coach, Steve Cherundolo, view the classic rivalry match as a crucial opportunity for redemption. LAFC currently sits fourth in the Western Conference, while the Galaxy is at the bottom of the table, but both sides agree that league standings are irrelevant in such an emotionally charged contest.

          <p>Deborah Mason, a 65-year-old grandmother known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for masterminding a sophisticated drug trafficking operation worth up to £80 million. Mason recruited her four children, her sister, and other associates to transport large quantities of cocaine from ports in southeast England to locations across the country. The family-run gang used encrypted apps and aliases to coordinate their activities, funding lavish lifestyles that included designer goods and luxury holidays. The sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court saw other members of the crime family receive lengthy prison terms for their roles in the conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated heavyweight title rematch, boxing experts are offering their predictions for the fight between Oleksandr Usyk and Daniel Dubois. While Usyk defeated Dubois in their first encounter, Dubois has since won three consecutive fights and captured the IBF world title, boosting his confidence. Pundits like Tony Bellew and Eddie Hearn lean towards another victory for the 38-year-old Usyk, citing his incredible form and experience, though they anticipate a tougher challenge this time. Others, such as promoter Ben Shalom, are backing the younger, more powerful Dubois to pull off an upset, making for a compelling and unpredictable championship bout.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese medical experts has developed a new, more affordable method for producing CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The innovative technique uses gene therapy tools to generate the specialized anticancer cells directly within the patient's body, eliminating the complex and expensive external manufacturing process. Researchers reported successfully using this in-vivo method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This breakthrough could dramatically reduce the cost of the treatment, which currently exceeds $139,200 per patient, potentially making it accessible to a much wider population.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers suffering a 2-0 shutout loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from the injured list. The right-hander pitched six impressive innings, allowing only one run while showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective use of his secondary pitches. This outing is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on Glasnow to bolster their starting rotation for the second half of the season. Glasnow attributed his success to a simplified, more athletic mindset on the mound, focusing on competing rather than overthinking his mechanics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. This legislation, a major victory for the cryptocurrency industry, requires stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar to be backed by liquid assets, paving the way for their broader use in payments. The crypto industry, which heavily supported pro-crypto candidates, views the law as a crucial step toward legitimization that will buttress the dollar's global status. However, critics have raised concerns that the law lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to exploitation. (not investment advice)</p>
