          <p>Chelsea secured the inaugural 32-team FIFA Club World Cup title with a decisive 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey. Attacking midfielder Cole Palmer was the star of the match, scoring two nearly identical goals and providing an assist for the third. Chelsea executed a clinical plan, absorbing pressure from PSG and striking effectively on the counter-attack, establishing their three-goal lead before halftime. Despite PSG's efforts in the second half, Chelsea's defense, led by goalkeeper Robert Sánchez, held firm to seal the historic win.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer urged investors to separate their personal political feelings, particularly regarding Donald Trump, from their financial decisions. He argued that despite many reasons to dislike the president, the market has shown resilience, potentially due to pro-business policies and the power of individual investors. Cramer discussed the potential long-term deflationary effects of artificial intelligence and deregulation, suggesting these forces could counteract inflationary pressures from tariffs. He concluded that a pro-capitalist environment is fostering conditions for rising stock prices, regardless of one's political stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In what was billed as his final career match, WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg was defeated by Gunther at the Saturday Night's Main Event in Atlanta. Gunther retained his World Heavyweight Championship after making Goldberg pass out from a sleeper hold. The match saw dramatic moments, including Goldberg hitting his signature Spear and Jackhammer, but he was unable to secure the pinfall. The event also featured a shocking upset where LA Knight defeated Seth Rollins, who appeared to suffer a legitimate knee injury during the match and had to be helped to the back.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his R&B roots in a similar vein to his previous projects "Journals" and "Changes." The album is described as feeling rawer and more improvisational than his past work, featuring murky production and demo-like tracks that reflect a tumultuous period in his life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee and Dijon, Bieber embraces a more idiosyncratic and less polished sound. The article positions the album as an authentic, if sometimes messy, reflection of the artist's personal and emotional state.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom since 1945. In his traditional Bastille Day speech to the military, Macron stated that annual defense spending will reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal originally set for 2030. This acceleration would double the defense budget from when he first took office in 2017. Macron pointed to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and "uncertainty" from the United States as key reasons for bolstering France's military power.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, written and directed by James Gunn, launched with an estimated $122 million in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada. This opening marks a significant test for DC Studios, which has seen recent superhero films underperform. The debut is the third largest of 2025 and the first DC film to surpass a $100 million opening weekend since 2017's "Wonder Woman." While a strong domestic start, the film, which cost about $225 million to produce, saw a relatively lower turnout internationally, grossing $95 million in overseas markets.</p>

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon championship, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set final.

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been repurposed into a unique, privately funded art gallery that is free to the public. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and spent eight years renovating it into the Cookie Factory gallery, which opened in May. Precourt's mission is to provide a space for community connection and personal healing through art, which she credits with helping her own mental wellness. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September before a new artist is featured.</p>

While some users find the technology to be a confidence booster and a useful icebreaker, the trend raises questions about authenticity.

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has stated that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the committee overseeing NOAA, is sending bipartisan recommendations to the president for a major investment in forecasting infrastructure. She argues that better technology, such as upgraded Doppler radar and data analytics, could provide communities with more advance warning for extreme weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. The call for action comes amid scrutiny of the federal response and potential staffing shortages at the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has subtly pushed back against escalating attacks from the Trump administration by updating its website with a "Frequently Asked Questions" page about its headquarters renovation. This move follows accusations from White House officials of mismanagement and "ostentatious" spending on the $2.5 billion project. The Fed's FAQ page directly addresses these claims, explaining cost increases and clarifying details, such as stating that "no new VIP dining rooms are being constructed." This quiet rebuttal represents the central bank's latest effort to defend its independence amid pressure from the administration to fire its chairman, Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
