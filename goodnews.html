          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a masterful performance, allowing just one run over five innings to secure his fifth consecutive victory for the Dodgers in a 6-3 win against the Cincinnati Reds. Kershaw, pitching on short rest, retired 14 consecutive batters after an early run, showcasing his refined pitching repertoire and effective use of various pitches. The Dodgers' offense steadily chipped away at the Reds' pitching, with key hits and a decisive four-run sixth inning, including a leadoff home run by Will Smith, solidifying their lead. This victory maintains the Dodgers' first-place standing in a tight National League West race, underscoring their strong push towards the season's end.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1991 has been opened, revealing a fascinating collection of items that capture life in the 1990s. Among the contents were a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a passport, and a pocket TV, all carefully selected by children who won a "Blue Peter" competition. Originally intended to remain sealed for centuries, the lead-encased wooden box was unearthed to facilitate the construction of a new children's cancer center. The article notes some damage to the objects but confirms they are largely intact, offering a unique and poignant glimpse into the past and a tangible connection to the late Princess.</p>

          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates a notable shift in US travel trends for the first half of 2025, with leisure travel experiencing a downturn while business travel remains robust. The United States emerged as the top global destination for business travelers, accounting for 15% of all international business air bookings, significantly outpacing other countries. This trend persists despite broader negative travel sentiment in other regions and ongoing global economic tensions, including Trump's tariff policies. The article suggests that corporate interests continue to drive travel to the US, with inbound business travel volume increasing slightly year-on-year, reinforcing its status as a stable hub for professional engagements.

          <h2>China's Industrial Profits Show Slower Decline Amid Price War Crackdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial companies experienced a slower pace of profit decline in July, falling 1.5% from a year earlier, marking the least contraction since May. This suggests that government efforts to curb overcapacity and aggressive price competition might be easing strain on producers, leading to a recovery in corporate profitability. While overall earnings for the first seven months still contracted, the manufacturing sector notably saw faster profit growth. The article highlights that despite this improvement, profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflation, which continues to impact corporate bottom lines across the world's second-largest economy.

These experiments, focusing on heat-resistant materials for fusion reactors, rocket engines, and hypersonic vehicles, demonstrate the reliability of the Chinese-developed laboratory cabinet. The article highlights these findings as crucial for designing better tungsten alloys and supporting fundamental research into ultra-high-temperature materials for future nuclear and aerospace applications, marking a competitive edge in space research.</p>

          <p>Angel Stadium, set to turn 60 next year, is undergoing a comprehensive assessment by the city of Anaheim to determine the hundreds of millions of dollars required to ensure its long-term viability. The Angels' current lease extends through 2032, and city officials confirm no immediate discussions are underway between the city and the team regarding plans beyond that. This evaluation follows the cancellation of a 2022 deal where Angels owner Arte Moreno would have purchased the stadium and surrounding land for redevelopment. Engineers are currently testing concrete and metal structures, with a finalized assessment expected in mid-2026, aiming to secure the future of the iconic "Big A" ballpark amidst evolving urban development needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a reduced rate of decline in July, slipping 1.5% from a year earlier, marking the slowest contraction in five months. This recovery is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and improving corporate margins amidst a campaign against price wars. While state-backed industrial firms still saw profit drops, businesses with foreign investments and the manufacturing and utilities sectors experienced profit increases. The article highlights this as a notable improvement after months of steeper declines, suggesting some effectiveness in government measures to bolster economic performance and indicating a potential easing of competitive strain on producers.

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, marking a significant turnaround after three consecutive failures this year. The 40-story-tall vehicle achieved key milestones, including the successful separation of its upper stage, deployment of eight Starlink satellite simulators, and a controlled powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean. While the Starship's heat shield and a control flap showed damage during reentry, the vehicle remained under control. This success is crucial for SpaceX's ambitions to colonize Mars and for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on a modified Starship to land astronauts on the moon by 2027, despite remaining technical hurdles.</p>
