          <p>The United States and China have announced substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of their ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted they were "in-depth" and "candid." These meetings, the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have raised hopes for tariff reductions and a reduction in economic tensions. The World Trade Organization has lauded the talks as a significant step, urging both nations to continue seeking solutions to restore confidence in the global trading system.</p>

          <p>The St. Vincent Jewelry Center in Los Angeles is experiencing a surge in activity as gold prices reach record highs due to global economic jitters. Merchants report a significant increase in customers looking to sell or melt down old jewelry, while others are investing in gold as a stable asset. This rally in gold prices coincides with President Trump's tariff announcements, which have contributed to financial market volatility and concerns about inflation. The surge in activity reflects a broader trend of investors seeking safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has discovered a collection of Nazi propaganda materials among its archives, including postcards, photographs, and other items intended to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The materials are believed to be linked to a shipment of 83 packages sent from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. The court has ordered the preservation and analysis of the documents, and Argentina's Holocaust Museum has been invited to assist in the process. Argentina is home to the largest Jewish population in Latin America and served as a refuge for many Nazis after the war.</p>

The company initiated the recall as a precautionary measure after federal regulators confirmed the strain matched one causing illnesses in a 2024 outbreak.

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order mandating that the U.S. pay the same prices for certain drugs as other economically advanced countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower medication costs, targeting drugs administered in doctor's offices and covered by Medicare. The order seeks to revive a similar initiative that faced legal challenges during Trump's first term. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to oppose the measure, arguing it could stifle innovation and reduce profits.

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally praised for supporting long lifespans, is under strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government aims to secure funds for child-rearing by saving from the medical system, increasing the burden on high medical cost patients. The plan has sparked backlash, leading to a freeze on envisioned hikes until after the upper house election. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust.</p>
