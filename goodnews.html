          <p>Shares of the online travel company Tripadvisor experienced a significant 17% jump after activist investment firm Starboard Value disclosed it had acquired a stake of over 9%. Starboard Value is well-known for taking positions in companies and advocating for strategic changes, such as cost-cutting measures or new leadership, to enhance shareholder value. The move comes after Tripadvisor's stock had been underperforming, and the company had previously formed a special committee to explore potential strategic options. This development suggests that major changes could be forthcoming for the travel review and booking platform. (not investment advice)</p>

The flight was carrying 109 passengers and six crew members at the time of the incident.

          <p>For the first time, Colombian authorities have seized an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," believed to be used for drug trafficking. The drone vessel, equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for remote operation, was intercepted off the Caribbean coast and is thought to be owned by the Gulf Clan cartel. Although the sub was empty, officials believe it was on a test run and had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine. This discovery highlights a technological escalation by cartels, moving toward sophisticated unmanned systems to reduce the risk of crew capture and detection.</p>

          <p>The United States economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and indicating continued resilience in the labor market despite broader economic concerns. The unemployment rate also saw a slight improvement, ticking down to 4.1% from 4.2% in the previous month. Job growth was primarily driven by the government and health care sectors. This steady performance complicates the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding potential interest rate cuts, as the strong labor market may reduce the urgency for monetary easing. The data suggests the economy remains on solid footing for now. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, the federal government continued to reduce its workforce, shedding 7,000 jobs.

The study, conducted by Generation Lab for CNBC, found that after compensation, career and skill development is the most important factor for young employees, ranking higher than remote work options. The survey also revealed reputational challenges for some major tech companies like Tesla and Meta, which were viewed more negatively than Exxon Mobil.

          <p>Amid shifting economic conditions, financial experts are advising seniors to re-evaluate their life insurance policies to ensure they still meet their needs. Key questions to consider include whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and if the current plan aligns with their estate goals. With factors like rising healthcare costs and changing family structures, a policy purchased decades ago may no longer be optimal. Professionals suggest reviewing beneficiaries, understanding the difference between term and whole life options, and considering how a payout might affect beneficiaries' financial situations.

          <p>The cost for the UK government to borrow has fallen, partially reversing a sharp spike from the previous day. The market volatility was initially triggered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves's emotional appearance in Parliament and fears she might resign over a U-turn on welfare reforms. However, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's subsequent expression of strong support for the chancellor helped calm investor nerves.

          <p>This essay offers a cultural and personal commentary on the American ritual of celebrating Independence Day with fireworks. The author recounts past experiences setting off fireworks with his father and embarks on a modern-day quest to legally replicate the experience on a beach in Maine. The journey reveals a complex web of state and local regulations that contrast with the ease of purchasing a vast array of consumer-grade pyrotechnics. Ultimately, the piece reflects on the simple, visceral joy of fireworks as a form of celebration, regardless of the legal and logistical hurdles involved in their deployment.</p>
