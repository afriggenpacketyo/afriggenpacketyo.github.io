          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major new contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, leading to a more than 2% rise in its share price during early trading. The South Korean technology giant did not disclose the name of the other party involved in the substantial deal. This news comes as Samsung prepares to release its quarterly earnings report, with analysts expecting a significant profit decline. The company has been facing challenges in competing with rivals like SK Hynix, particularly in the booming market for artificial intelligence chips, making this contract a notable development.</p>

          <p>My Chemical Romance performed their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety at a sold-out Dodger Stadium, marking a new career peak for the influential emo band. The concert, part of their first-ever stadium tour, featured elaborate theatrical elements, including a narrative depicting the band performing for a fictional dictator. This tour's success highlights the group's enduring appeal, rooted in its blend of dramatic world-building and frank lyrical explorations of depression and identity, which have influenced a new generation of artists. Following the full album performance, the band played a set of other fan favorites and a previously unreleased song.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, cementing his status among the sport's elite. Despite heavy rain and slippery conditions on the final stage in Paris, which had been neutralized for safety, Pogačar displayed his characteristic daring by launching an attack rather than finishing safely in the pack. Although he did not win the final stage, which went to Belgian rider Wout van Aert, his overall lead was insurmountable. Pogačar finished 4 minutes and 24 seconds ahead of two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, marking the fifth consecutive year the two rivals have finished first and second in the prestigious race.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese position player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, was inducted in Cooperstown alongside pitcher CC Sabathia and reliever Billy Wagner. Suzuki, known for his record-breaking 262 hits in a single season and combined 4,367 professional hits, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection. The ceremony also honored the late Dave Parker and Dick Allen posthumously. Sabathia, a former Cy Young Award winner, and Suzuki were teammates for over two seasons, making their joint induction particularly special. The event highlighted the profound and growing connection between Japanese baseball and Major League Baseball.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a significant increase in applications for their citizenship by investment (CBI) programs, largely driven by wealthy US citizens. For as little as $200,000, these programs offer a passport and visa-free travel to up to 150 countries, including the UK and Europe's Schengen area. Investment migration experts suggest that political and social volatility in the US, including concerns about gun violence and political instability, is fueling the demand. While the programs provide crucial revenue for the island nations, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over potential security risks and financial crime.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods and averting a threatened 30% rate. The deal was announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after negotiations in Scotland. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and investing $600 billion in the US over three years. While the deal brings stability, the 15% tariff is higher than pre-Trump rates, and a punitive 50% tariff on steel remains, marking a complex outcome for transatlantic trade relations.</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries at the Keeladi site in India's Tamil Nadu state are challenging established historical narratives and have become a political flashpoint. Artifacts dating back to 580 BCE suggest the existence of a sophisticated, literate urban society in southern India, concurrent with the well-documented Vedic period in the north. Some experts claim these findings, including a Tamil Brahmi script that may predate the northern Ashokan Brahmi, indicate an independent or even earlier origin for southern civilization. This has fueled regional pride and political tensions, with accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress findings that counter a north-centric view of Indian history.</p>

          <p>A profile of comedian John Oliver explores his journey from the UK stand-up circuit to becoming one of America's most influential satirists with his HBO show "Last Week Tonight." The article details his meticulous, research-heavy process, which combines comedy with deep dives into complex, often obscure, systemic problems like hospice care and bail reform. Oliver, now a U.S. citizen married to an Iraq War veteran, views his critical commentary not as an attack on his adopted country but as an expression of love and a desire for it to improve. He emphasizes that failure is a crucial teacher in comedy and that his goal is to make people laugh about things he genuinely cares about.</p>

          <p>An investigative journalist and a photographer successfully tracked down and facilitated the return of a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." During the regime, political prisoners were drugged and thrown from the plane into the Atlantic Ocean. The investigation, which spanned two decades, involved locating the plane in the U.S., where it was being used for skydiving, and meticulously analyzing its flight logs. This evidence proved crucial in a landmark 2017 trial, leading to life sentences for the pilots. The plane has now been returned to Argentina and stands as a physical witness at the ESMA Museum and Memorial.</p>

          <p>This article presents a case for investing in Honeywell (HON) following a significant drop in its stock price after a positive earnings report.

Despite these factors, the author expresses strong conviction in the company's underlying value, citing its leadership in aerospace, automation, and advanced materials.
