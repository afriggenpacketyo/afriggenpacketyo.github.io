          <p>Apollo Global Management is set to provide a ¬£4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, addressing a funding shortfall. This investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package features an interest rate below 7%. The project, which involves constructing two nuclear reactors, has faced delays and budget increases, with China General Nuclear Power Corp halting its funding in late 2023. The Hinkley Point C project is expected to power around six million homes, highlighting the significance of private capital in European infrastructure projects.

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax incentives to attract data centers, leading to significant losses in tax revenue. A CNBC analysis reveals that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. Watchdog groups argue that these facilities do not create enough jobs to justify the tax breaks, while their energy consumption is immense. The growing number of tax breaks has sparked debate about whether massive corporations should receive such generous incentives. The article highlights the financial implications of these incentives for states and the potential drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite some claims that Gen Z is becoming more conservative, data suggests that the youth vote shift in 2024 was likely a one-off event rather than a lasting ideological realignment. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024 compared to 2020, they have become less likely to identify as conservative. On specific issues, young adults remain more liberal than previous generations, with increasing support for legal status for undocumented immigrants and addressing the effects of slavery. The author concludes that Gen Z's dissatisfaction with the economy may have driven their votes in 2024, rather than a fundamental shift to the right.

          <p>Tesco has apologized after a promotional display advertising a chance to meet the England women's football team (Lionesses) was put up at a store in Cardiff, Wales. Customers expressed shock and anger, especially given that Wales faces England at Euro 2025. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) chief executive voiced his displeasure on social media. Tesco has since removed the display from the store and wished both the Welsh and English teams good luck in the tournament.

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding after the destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to guide the rebuilding process. The commission also proposed a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District to focus on wildfire prevention. The recommendations aim to rebuild neighborhoods in ways that are more resilient to wildfires and address climate change. The author's tone reflects the proactive measures being proposed to address future risks. Score is reflective of the positive impact of the potential changes.</p>
