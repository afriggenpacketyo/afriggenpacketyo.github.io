          <p>Amazon's Zoox is increasing its robotaxi production at a new facility in Hayward, California, to prepare for its commercial launch in Las Vegas later this year. The facility currently produces one robotaxi per day but aims to increase this rate significantly over the next year, with a full-scale capacity of 10,000 robotaxis annually. Zoox, acquired by Amazon in 2020, is testing its robotaxis in several cities and plans to operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities, the company said. The company's CEO, Aicha Evans, emphasized that the company is focused on deploying a ride-hailing service rather than selling the vehicles. </p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to reach 30C, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. Yellow heat-health alerts are in place for most of England, indicating a greater risk to vulnerable people, and temperatures will peak in different regions on different days. The Met Office study indicates a rising risk of exceeding 40C in the UK in the next 12 years, citing climate change as a driving factor. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where temperatures could approach 40C. </p>

          <p>NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured an image of an intense solar flare released by the sun on Tuesday evening. The solar flare, classified as an X-class flare (the most intense type), peaked at 5:49 p.m. EDT, sending energy, light, and high-speed particles into space. Solar flares can disrupt radio communications, electric power grids, and navigation signals, and they can also pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. The flare was also associated with a coronal mass ejection, which can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth, as seen in May and October 2024. </p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. and is celebrated annually on June 19. The name Juneteenth combines June and nineteenth, marking the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. Although President Lincoln signed the Proclamation in 1863, it wasn't until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, that the news reached the westernmost Confederate state. The holiday symbolizes independence, unity, and resilience, with celebrations including parades, parties, and cultural events. </p>

The steel will continue to be "mined, melted and made" in the United States, and the partnership is expected to create over 100,000 jobs. Nippon Steel has agreed to invest approximately $11 billion in U.S. Steel by 2028, including an initial investment in a greenfield project. The agreement also includes a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, requiring that the majority of U.S. Steel's board members and key management personnel be U.S. citizens. </p>

          <p>Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel has been finalized, granting the US government an unusual degree of control through a "golden share." This share gives the government veto authority over corporate decisions such as idling plants, cutting production, and moving jobs overseas. The agreement also includes $11 billion in investment for US Steel through 2028, including $1 billion for a new US mill. The acquisition allows Nippon Steel to capitalize on American infrastructure projects while avoiding steel tariffs, though it faced opposition from the United Steelworkers union and political figures. </p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business or face a nationwide ban for the third time. The extension, lasting 90 days, aims to allow the administration to ensure a deal is closed so that Americans can continue using TikTok securely. This decision marks another pause in the enforcement of a bipartisan law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations. Previous delays occurred due to potential deals being curtailed by Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected a challenge brought by Texas and landowners against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a plan to store nuclear waste in the state. The court determined that neither Texas nor the land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding, thus they cannot obtain judicial review. The ruling reverses a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The court did not address the broader issue of whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite. </p>

          <p>Purchasing a $500,000 annuity at age 65 can provide a reliable retirement income, but the exact monthly payout depends on factors like gender, annuity type, and interest rates. For a 65-year-old male, a $500,000 immediate fixed annuity could yield around $3,269 per month for life, while a female of the same age might receive around $3,151 per month. Joint life annuities, covering two people, typically offer lower monthly payments. Interest rates, the type of annuity, and payout features also influence the monthly income, with higher rates and deferred annuities generally providing more generous payouts.
