          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstructed natural light. Several projects have been scrapped due to local opposition, prompting industry groups to work on improving relations between residents and tech companies. Municipalities are beginning to implement regulations, such as requiring early construction announcements and clear indication of heat-emitting units, as demand for data handling continues to surge. The Japan Data Center Council emphasizes the importance of business owners disclosing information and building trust with affected communities.</p>

          <p>An attempted copper theft in Van Nuys resulted in a widespread internet outage affecting parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties after vandals cut through fiber-optic cables, mistaking them for copper.

The company emphasized that its fiber lines do not contain copper and that such incidents are affecting the entire telecommunications industry due to the rising price of precious metals.

          <p>China's retail sales in May experienced their fastest growth since late 2023, increasing by 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates and accelerating from the previous month, boosted by extended holidays and the consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8%, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, falling short of expectations, while property investment continued to contract. The urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, the lowest since November. Despite the positive retail sales figures, falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, and the acquisition would give the consortium control of Australian liquefied natural gas operations.

This move follows media revelations of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with a police survey estimating over 3 million people in the country have gambled online.

Researchers have extended the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years at a brightness comparable to commercial displays. The team's PeLEDs reached a brightness of 1.16 million nits, far exceeding the brightest commercial display screens.

          <p>Lando Norris admitted to feeling foolish after colliding with McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri during the Canadian Grand Prix, with the incident raising questions about Norris' state of mind. Norris has struggled this season compared to Piastri, making mistakes in qualifying and expressing a lack of feel from the car's front axle. McLaren introduced a tweak to the suspension geometry to improve Norris' feel, but he still over-drove in qualifying, brushing the wall and ending up seventh. The team is working with Norris to address his difficulties, but Stella does not believe the wider issues directly caused the collision.</p>
