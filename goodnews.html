          <p>This article discusses the importance of public lands and the need to protect them from privatization, arguing that federal management of these resources benefits all Americans. It traces the history of public lands management from the American Revolution to Theodore Roosevelt's conservation efforts. The author contends that private resource users have often been poor stewards of the environment, leading to ecological ruin. The piece emphasizes that public lands are essential for modeling a sustainable future and should be managed for the benefit of all people, and that the sale of public lands would remove protections against exploitation.</p>

The effort, organized by Friends of the Los Angeles River, aims to restore biodiversity and improve the river's ability to filter runoff. The removal of the mustard helps reduce the risk of wildfires and allows native trees to thrive. Participants expressed a sense of empowerment in addressing environmental challenges, particularly after recent wildfires, noting the tangible impact of their work.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on inherited Roth IRAs and retirement planning, addressing questions about spousal inheritance and strategies for those behind on savings.

While acknowledging the challenges and backlash, they highlight key wins, including increased public support for abolition, legislation inspired by the Breathe Act, and significant investments in community services.

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following his predecessor's controversial remarks. The survey also indicates that many believe rice prices should be brought below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The poll shows increased approval for Ishiba's Cabinet, with 42.2% of respondents believing the removal of the previous farm minister should have happened sooner.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalised, marking the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The government called the move a "new dawn for rail" but held back from promising lower fares, focusing more on plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the nationalisation of SWR as a "real watershed moment", but said she could not promise that ticket prices would fall for passengers. The government hopes to find ways to cut the cost of rail travel but it is impossible to make promises before GBR is formally established and services renationalised.</p>
