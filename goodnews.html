          <h2>The Ideological Brain: Exploring the Biological Roots of Belief</h2>

          <p>An interview with cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod discusses her book, "The Ideological Brain," which explores how political beliefs are not just beliefs but also neurological signatures. Zmigrod defines ideology as a fixed doctrine resistant to evidence, coupled with a rigid identity influencing judgment. She differentiates ideology from culture and religion by its intolerance of deviation and emphasizes the importance of cognitive flexibility, tested through unconscious assessments like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The article delves into the psychological underpinnings of rigid thinking, linking it to a fear of uncertainty and the brain's attempt to resolve ambiguity, while also cautioning against pathologizing conviction and highlighting the fine line between principles and dogmas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have announced a temporary agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions and establish a basis for broader negotiations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that both sides will reduce tariffs by 115%, resulting in a reciprocal tariff rate of 10%. The agreement, reached after talks in Geneva, seeks to alleviate market volatility and recession fears triggered by previous tariff measures. Both countries will continue discussions on economic and trade policy during this period, potentially alternating venues between China, the United States, or a mutually agreed third country.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting millions, a regulatory change has eased the path to permanent residency for temporary workers, particularly in the horse-racing industry. A new rule clarifies that workers on H-2B visas can apply for green cards without jeopardizing their visa status. This change offers employers more certainty in retaining prized employees amidst uncertainty about future visa caps. The article notes that employers are increasingly exploring green card sponsorship as an alternative to work visas, providing stability for both employers and employees in sectors facing labor shortages.</p>

While the situation along the border remains tense, with displaced populations still away from their homes, the cease-fire marks a positive step after weeks of cross-border shelling and escalating aerial clashes.

          <p>A new U.S. rule mandates that hotels and short-term lodging companies must disclose all mandatory fees upfront, including "resort fees," which often cover services travelers may not want or need. The rule aims to provide transparency and prevent businesses from charging more without explicitly raising prices. However, concerns exist about the Trump administration's efforts to cut enforcement staff at the FTC and CFPB, potentially limiting the rule's effectiveness.

          <p>Two new studies on wild chimpanzees reveal important building blocks of human speech in their communication, specifically rhythmic structures and call combinations. The research analyzed drumming patterns and vocalizations of chimps, finding that different populations use different rhythmic structures, similar to regional accents. Additionally, the studies found that chimps combine calls to create new meanings, suggesting that these abilities were already present when the first humans appeared.
