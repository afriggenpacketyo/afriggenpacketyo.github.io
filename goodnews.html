        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax after the U.S. threatened to terminate trade discussions. The 3% levy would have applied to large tech companies like Amazon and Google, and its withdrawal is intended to facilitate negotiations for a new comprehensive economic deal. This move marks a significant reversal from Canada's previous stance and aims to de-escalate trade tensions between the two nations ahead of a July deadline for talks.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Cause More Motion Sickness</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional internal combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this to the unique characteristics of EVs, such as rapid acceleration and the low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking systems. These functions, which help charge the battery, can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers, presenting a new challenge for automotive engineers to address in future designs.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was first imposed in August 2023. The ban was a direct response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The reversal follows bilateral agreements between the two nations and is expected to restore a significant trade relationship, though it may take a few months for shipments to fully resume pending procedural steps.</p>
