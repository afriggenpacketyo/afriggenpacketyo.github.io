          <h2>Uber to Pilot Feature Allowing Women to Preferentially Match with Women Drivers and Riders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in several U.S. cities that will allow women and non-binary riders to request women drivers, and vice-versa. This "women rider preference" feature aims to enhance safety and comfort on the ride-hailing platform, addressing long-standing concerns about sexual assault and harassment. While not a guarantee, the tool increases the likelihood of a match. The company has previously tested similar features in approximately 40 other countries, starting with Saudi Arabia in 2019 after women gained the right to drive there.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer advertisement, ruling it was "irresponsible" for featuring a model who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog noted that the model's pose, clothing, and pointed shoes accentuated her slenderness, and her head seemed disproportionate to her body. M&S defended the ad, stating the model was healthy and the pose was meant to convey confidence, not slimness, but has since removed the image. This action follows a similar ban on an ad from retailer Next for similar reasons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As rising interest rates and tighter lending standards make it harder for homeowners to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), financial experts advise on next steps. If denied, borrowers should first ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to high debt-to-income ratios or low credit scores. Proactive strategies to improve approval odds include checking credit reports for errors, reducing existing debt, and shopping around with different lenders. Experts also suggest considering alternatives like home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials made the convictions "unsafe," representing a major vindication for the traders who maintained their innocence. The men, who both served jail time, argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>Toy manufacturer Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division. Revenue from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment, which includes popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew by 16%. This growth helped to offset a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which has been negatively impacted by U.S. tariffs and changes in retailer ordering. The company reported an overall net loss primarily due to a significant goodwill impairment charge related to these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system, named Aeneas, that can help historians analyze ancient Roman inscriptions. The tool is designed to fill in missing words from degraded texts, and also to accurately estimate their date and geographical origin by cross-referencing a vast database of 176,000 known inscriptions. While AI can introduce errors, tests showed that historians working in conjunction with Aeneas produced more accurate results than either could alone. Prominent classicists believe the technology could be "transformative" by dramatically accelerating the painstaking process of piecing together historical evidence.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Ben Schneider, the frontman of the band Lord Huron, delved into the themes of their new album, "The Cosmic Selector: Vol. 1." He explained that the music focuses on posing profound, often unanswerable questions about life, consciousness, and the universe, reflecting his fascination with mystery. Schneider also spoke about the importance of embracing one's unique or "weird" qualities, a concept central to the album's introspective nature. The discussion touched on his literary influences, his surprise at the band's mainstream success, and the creative process of blending modern and analog technology in their music.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that a "clean, healthy and sustainable environment" is a human right. The UN's top court stated that countries have a legal obligation under international law to protect the climate for present and future generations from the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling, prompted by a request from Pacific Island nations, clarifies that states must cooperate to prevent climate harm and ensure their national targets reflect the highest possible ambition.

          <p>A classical music concert at the Reggia di Caserta palace near Naples, Italy, has been abruptly canceled following a public outcry over the scheduled appearance of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev. Gergiev, a known public supporter of Vladimir Putin, has faced widespread criticism and cancellations across Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Opponents, including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late opposition leader, argued that welcoming him legitimizes the Russian government. The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the cancellation as "cultural censorship," while advocates hailed it as a stand against dictatorship.</p>

After a period of post-Soviet indifference, long lines have returned, filled with a mix of soldiers, families, and tourists.

          <p>Scientists in Barbados have rediscovered the world's smallest-known snake, the Barbados threadsnake, which had not been seen for almost 20 years and was feared to be extinct. The tiny snake, which can fit on a coin and grows to only four inches, was found by a research team under a rock in a small forest. First identified as a unique species in 2008, the blind, burrowing snake eats termites and ants. Conservationists are hopeful that the rediscovery of this rare endemic species can serve as a catalyst for protecting the island's remaining wildlife habitats.</p>

She warned that if intense competitive pressure from China leads to significant losses for European companies, the fundamental benefits of the relationship will be questioned.

For others, a formal Debt Management Plan through a credit counselor can negotiate better terms, while debt settlement or, as a last resort, bankruptcy, offer more drastic solutions for overwhelming debt.

          <p>Australian Wallabies wing Harry Potter has rejected criticism from former British and Irish Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward, who claimed the team has a "losing mentality." The critique came after Australia's captain kicked the ball out of play to end the first Test match while trailing 27-19, rather than playing on. Potter called the suggestion "ridiculous," insisting that every player was intent on winning the game. With the team now 1-0 down in the series, Potter acknowledged they did not play their best and must improve for the second Test to keep their hopes alive.</p>
