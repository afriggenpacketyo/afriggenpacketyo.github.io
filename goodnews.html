        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to stimulate economic growth. The plan involves converting the existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 annually by the late 2030s. Despite opposition from environmental groups concerned about increased noise, pollution, and climate impact, the government has framed the privately-financed expansion as a "no-brainer for growth." The airport has agreed to stricter noise controls to mitigate local impact.</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as potential partners, describing them as "American patriots." The deal aims to address national security concerns by transferring control of the popular app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, with the new structure reportedly featuring a majority-American board and U.S. control over the algorithm and data privacy.</p>

          <p>England defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match to secure a 2-0 series victory, the first-ever T20 series between the two nations. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, anchored the chase with a crucial 55 runs after Ireland set a target of 155. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup on a slower pitch in Malahide. The win concludes a successful series for the English side under the captaincy of Jacob Bethell, who praised the team's aggressive play throughout the week.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, describing it as the beginning of a "fight back to rescue this street." The event, which pedestrianized a half-mile stretch of the famous shopping district, is a preview of a potential permanent ban aimed at increasing foot traffic and improving the area for shoppers and visitors. While many pedestrians welcomed the change, some local businesses and residents have raised concerns about the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets and accessibility issues for those with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>The Amur Tiger Center in Russia has shared remarkable footage showing the raw power of two rehabilitated Amur tigers being released back into their natural habitat. The video shows the massive predators, a brother and sister, snarling and aggressively attacking the doors of their cages as they are opened, highlighting their wild instincts. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are an endangered species with only 500-600 estimated to be in the wild. Conservation groups emphasize the importance of protecting their habitat to ensure the survival of these majestic animals.</p>

          <p>U.S. runner Cole Hocker claimed the men's 5,000m gold medal at the World Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final-lap surge. Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to overtake the field, finishing in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory served as redemption for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1500m semi-finals earlier in the competition for jostling. He stated that he felt "robbed" in the earlier race and was determined to end the championships on his own terms with a victory.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage if they underperform, due to a controversial new payment scheme. For the first time, U.S. players will each receive a $500,000 stipend, while the European team continues to play without payment. Donald believes that if the expensive-to-attend event sees a paid American team struggling, the notoriously tough New York fans might turn on their own players. He affirmed that his team remains motivated by purpose and the tradition of the event rather than monetary rewards.</p>

          <p>To prevent production flaws that have affected other aircraft manufacturers, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet has been upgraded into a futuristic smart factory. The system integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to create a unified communication backbone connecting all tools, robots, and workers, ensuring no oversight like a missing bolt can occur. This "sensing-transmission-control integration" allows for real-time monitoring and intelligent feedback throughout the final assembly process. The innovation aims to enhance the safety and reliability of China's first domestically developed large passenger aircraft, positioning it as a competitor in the global aviation market.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of swimmers took part in the first officially sanctioned swim in the Chicago River in almost 100 years, marking a significant milestone for the once notoriously polluted waterway. The event celebrates decades of environmental progress, stemming from the 1970s Clean Water Act, which has transformed the river from a toxic industrial sewer into a recreational hub where wildlife has returned. Organizers hope the swim will become an annual event and inspire other cities to reclaim their urban rivers. The transformation highlights a major environmental success story, though advocates warn that vigilance is needed to prevent rollbacks in water protection regulations.</p>

          <p>UCLA's interim football coach, Tim Skipper, is finalizing a deal to bring veteran assistant Kevin Coyle onto the defensive staff for the remainder of the season. The move aims to stabilize the team's struggling defense following the recent departure of coordinator Ikaika Malloe. Coyle, 69, previously worked with Skipper at Fresno State, where their defense performed well. With UCLA's defense currently ranking among the worst in major college football after an 0-3 start, the hope is that Coyle's extensive experience as a coordinator in both college and the NFL will help improve the unit's performance.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, stocks have surged to new records, with some Wall Street strategists believing there is still room for growth. While acknowledging that the S&P 500's valuation is historically high, analysts argue that the modern market, heavily influenced by high-margin technology and AI-driven productivity, justifies higher multiples. Bank of America notes that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks may not have peaked yet compared to past market bubbles. However, some experts caution that further "melt-up" rallies could fuel speculative excess rather than reflect fundamental strength, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this decline. However, Epel notes that this damage is reversible through lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory" environment for our cells. She recommends four key practices to de-stress and promote cellular health: eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into your diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>
