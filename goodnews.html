          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly stated his intention to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. Trump communicated his plans to the Chrisleys' daughter, Savannah, expressing hope to finalize the pardon quickly. The Chrisleys, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks and the IRS. White House spokesman Harrison Fields emphasized Trump's desire to give deserving Americans a second chance, especially those unfairly targeted by the justice system. The Chrisleys were sentenced to 12 and 7 years respectively.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend homeowners carefully consider their financial situation before borrowing from their home equity this June, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment. They advise ensuring affordability, having a clear purpose for the funds, and choosing the right home equity option, whether a home equity loan or a HELOC. It's important to limit risk by borrowing less than the approved amount and confirming stable income. Borrowing against your home carries substantial risks since it's secured by your home, so homeowners should shop and compare rates before applying. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from Vanguard suggests that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing the impact of income or assets. The survey found that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, compared to 12% for an income of $500,000 and 18% for assets of $1 million or more. This finding underscores the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, as the median cost of an emergency is about $2,000. The research highlights that having readily available cash provides a sense of security and reduces financial anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>
