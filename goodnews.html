        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer with ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the next Surgeon General, replacing his initial pick, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Means, known for her skepticism towards the traditional medical system and co-authorship of "Good Energy," advocates for addressing metabolic dysfunction as the root of chronic diseases. Her brother, Calley Means, is a top advisor to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the siblings have gained popularity among conservatives through appearances on podcasts. This appointment signals a shift towards alternative health perspectives within the administration, particularly with the influence of Secretary Kennedy.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje, a 30-year-old player, is poised to be named captain of the British and Irish Lions for their tour of Australia, making him the first Englishman since 2001 to hold the prestigious position. Itoje, who assumed the England captaincy before the 2025 Six Nations, is highly regarded by former Lions and is seen as a strong leader after guiding England to a second-place finish. The formal announcement, along with the rest of the Lions squad, will be made at the O2 Arena, marking Itoje's third tour with the Lions. The team is scheduled to face Argentina in Dublin before commencing their Australian matches.</p>

          <p>A piece of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere this week. NASA believes that the lander probe, a durable, spherical object, may partially survive the re-entry process. While the exact landing location remains uncertain, experts consider the risk to people on the ground to be low, as most of the planet is covered by water. The spacecraft never escaped low Earth orbit, and this re-entry marks the end of its over half-century journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to reduce interest rates, potentially cutting them to 4.25% from 4.5%, with further reductions expected later in the year, according to analysts. This move aims to lower borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, although it may also result in lower returns for savers. The Monetary Policy Committee is closely monitoring inflation, which currently stands at 2.6%, but is expected to rise due to recent bill increases, as well as global economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariff policies.</p>
