          <h2>UK Billionaire Count Declines Amidst Tax Policy Changes, While King's Wealth Rises</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 01:34:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Sunday Times Rich List reveals a decrease in the number of billionaires residing in the UK, dropping from 165 to 156, which is the largest decline in the list's history. This decline is attributed to criticism surrounding tax changes implemented by the new Labour government, specifically the abolition of non-dom status. In contrast, King Charles' personal wealth has increased, now equaling that of former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife. The Hinduja family remains at the top of the list, despite a decrease in their fortune, with a total worth exceeding ¬£35 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan witnessed record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought safer havens amidst trade tensions and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. economy. The shift was largely driven by institutional investors diversifying away from U.S. assets, with pension funds and reserve managers playing a significant role. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the inflows reflect a broader trend of investors seeking stability in Japanese markets, which are generally considered a safe haven.</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a new law allowing for preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The law mandates key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches and aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations. While the government assures that domestic communications and message content will not be surveilled, concerns have been raised regarding potential overreach and violations of privacy rights.</p>
