          <p>Several Trump administration officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mehmet Oz, Brooke Rollins, and Scott Turner, advocate for requiring able-bodied adults to work, participate in job training, or volunteer to receive welfare benefits. They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up rather than a lifelong handout, emphasizing that work provides purpose, dignity, and strengthens communities. The officials point to the success of the 1996 welfare reform under President Clinton as evidence that work requirements can reduce dependency and poverty. The proposed changes aim to prioritize the vulnerable and rebuild thriving communities while protecting taxpayer dollars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that weight-loss medications, specifically GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and bariatric surgery are linked to reduced risk of obesity-related cancers (ORC). Researchers found that GLP-1 RAs have a 41% relative risk reduction for ORC compared to bariatric surgery, suggesting additional pathways beyond weight loss contribute to this decreased risk. Experts note that GLP-1 RAs reduce inflammation, a known risk factor for various cancers, and improve metabolic health by lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance. The study suggests that weight reduction and inflammation reduction play important roles in cancer prevention, emphasizing the need for a healthy lifestyle.</p>
