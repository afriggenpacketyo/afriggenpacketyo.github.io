          <p>China is accelerating efforts to finalize an upgraded free-trade agreement, known as Cafta 3.0, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) by the end of the year. This move aims to strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner and diversify exports as global supply chains evolve. The agreement will expand market access in key sectors like agriculture and digital trade, while also deepening cooperation in emerging areas such as the green economy and artificial intelligence. This initiative is viewed as a strategic effort to bolster regional trade networks in response to increasing US tariffs and protectionist policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has announced plans for the international launch of its affordable Mona series in 2026, starting with Europe next year. The Mona M03 model, priced aggressively under $17,000 in China, is expected to intensify competition with both Chinese rivals and established global automakers. CEO He Xiaopeng noted that the company's international expansion is proceeding faster than anticipated and signaled openness to acquiring other EV companies to navigate the highly competitive market. The move comes as Chinese EV makers are gaining market share in Europe while domestic price wars continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially entered the contest to become the next deputy leader of the Labour Party, following the recent resignation of Angela Rayner. She is the most senior party figure to declare her candidacy so far, joining backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race. Candidates face a tight deadline to secure the necessary nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs by Thursday evening. The compressed timeline has drawn criticism from some within the party, who argue it limits broader discussion about Labour's future direction and policies.</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts across England have been released, with specialist hospitals securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase public transparency and accountability, with top-performing trusts gaining more autonomy. However, NHS Providers, the organization representing the trusts, has raised concerns about whether the chosen metrics accurately reflect performance and could lead to unintended consequences for patient care.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu is set to issue a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure funding for its artificial intelligence initiatives amid recently reported weak quarterly earnings. The bond, which is denominated in yuan but issued outside mainland China, allows the company to capitalize on relatively low Chinese interest rates. This move is part of a broader trend of issuers turning to dim sum bonds as an alternative to US dollar assets. The issuance follows Baidu's second-quarter report, which showed a decline in both revenue and net profit compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>
