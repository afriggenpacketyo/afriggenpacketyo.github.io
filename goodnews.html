          <p>A study by the European Travel Commission (ETC) indicates that U.S. tourists are reducing their summer travel to Europe, with only 33% planning a visit compared to 40% last year, largely due to high travel costs and political concerns. However, interest in European summer trips has surged among Chinese travelers, with 72% planning such a holiday, a 10% increase from the previous year, driven by growing disposable incomes and favorable travel policies. Over half of Chinese travelers now include shopping as part of their European travel plans, though they are also tightening their belts, with most looking to spend between 100 and 200 euros per day.</p>

          <p>Chinese film distributors have pledged to diversify the country's cinematic offerings by importing more high-quality titles from overseas, as domestic productions currently dominate the market. At a China Film Group Corporation conference, distributors committed to improving the number, quality, and market share of foreign films, aiming to leverage their positive effect on market diversification. Mao Yu, an associate director of the Communist Party‚Äôs publicity department, emphasized the need to encourage more good international films to enter the Chinese market. Domestic titles have driven China's strong box office rebound this year, with almost 96% of revenue attributed to them.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic explores birthright citizenship, or jus solis, as a New World ideal rooted in the Americas, where nearly every country grants citizenship to children born within its territory, regardless of their parents' nationality. This contrasts with jus sanguinis, which assigns citizenship based on parental nationality, often tied to bloodline or race. The article traces the history of jus solis from its origins in Mexico's 1814 constitution to its adoption throughout Spanish America, emphasizing its connection to race and slavery politics. The piece also examines challenges to birthright citizenship in the United States and the Dominican Republic, highlighting the potential for chaos and statelessness if the U.S. were to limit or abolish it.</p>

          <p>With homes increasingly at risk from floods due to climate change, elevation is being explored as a solution to protect properties, particularly in coastal areas like New Jersey. After Superstorm Sandy, many homeowners invested in raising their homes, demonstrating that elevation can save houses from floodwaters. However, elevation is an expensive solution, and raising homes alone won't fully protect a community from flooding. The article highlights the need for more funding and faster access to grants for families to elevate their homes, as well as the importance of protecting key infrastructure like roads and utilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied that the government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, arguing instead that it was made possible by an improved economy. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. Starmer stated that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and trade deals with the US, India, and the EU allowed the government to increase the eligibility threshold. Critics argue that the change will create new complexity in the tax system and that the government has already spent savings from the original cut.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing anti-diversity and anti-transgender executive orders in grant funding requirements. The judge ruled that the federal government cannot force recipients to halt programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or acknowledge the existence of transgender people in order to receive grant funding. The order will remain in effect during the legal case, with the judge stating that the funding provisions reflect an effort to censor constitutionally protected speech. The plaintiffs include health centers, LGBTQ+ services groups, and the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Historical Society.</p>
