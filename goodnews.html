          <h2>WNBA Players Advocate for Higher Pay Amidst League's Financial Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:15 EDT</div>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding better compensation, highlighting the issue with "Pay us what you owe us" warm-up shirts at the All-Star Game amid stalled collective bargaining negotiations. While the league has reported annual losses, other financial indicators like rising attendance, soaring broadcast rights values, and increased team valuations suggest significant growth. Players argue their share of revenue is under 10%, a very low figure for a professional sports league, and point to the disparity between the WNBA's minimum salary and that of the NBA. They are advocating for higher pay and larger roster sizes to increase job security.</p>

          <h2>US Lawmakers Introduce Bills to Ban Toxic Chemicals from Cosmetics and Personal Care Products</h2>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has proposed the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills aimed at increasing federal oversight of the cosmetics industry. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous ingredients like formaldehyde and phthalates, which are linked to serious health issues and are disproportionately found in products marketed to women of color and salon workers. The bills would also mandate greater transparency in ingredient disclosure, addressing gaps in the 2022 Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act. Consumer advocates and over 150 companies have endorsed the package, urging the U.S. to align its safety standards more closely with those in the European Union.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," the notorious leader of the "Los Choneros" drug gang, to the United States. Macías, who had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His organization is accused of smuggling weapons from the U.S. and controlling key trafficking routes through violence and intimidation. The extradition was carried out under heavy security and follows a U.S. indictment and assurances regarding the respect for his rights, marking a significant step in bilateral efforts to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

          <h2>Nanovaccine Developed by China-Singapore Team Shows Promise in Suppressing Cancer in Animal Studies</h2>

          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed an innovative nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal trials. The bio-inspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are known for their self-renewal properties that contribute to tumor growth and spread. Published in Nature Nanotechnology, the findings detail a method with the potential for creating personalized cancer vaccines. This development represents a promising step forward in the fight against cancer by addressing one of the key mechanisms behind treatment failure and relapse.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Utilize 'Power Law' Principle for High-Return Startup Investments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on the "power law" principle when deciding which startups to fund, focusing on companies with the potential for exceptionally large returns. This strategy, originating from economist Vilfredo Pareto's observations, acknowledges that a small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all other losses or smaller successes. VCs therefore seek startups with "outsized-outcome potential," looking for visionary founders and ideas that can define a new category. Founders are advised to pitch a bold, compelling story about their company's potential to achieve massive scale. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a preliminary trade agreement, U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure supplies. These critical components are essential for high-tech manufacturing, including electric vehicles and wind turbines. The increase comes after Beijing eased export restrictions that had been imposed in retaliation for U.S. tariffs, which had caused shortages and production disruptions for some global firms. Despite the monthly surge, the export volume remains lower than the previous year, highlighting ongoing supply chain vulnerabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since privatization, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report addresses widespread criticism over sewage spills and leaks, suggesting stronger environmental regulation and minimum capital levels to prevent companies from taking on excessive debt. The proposals acknowledge that massive investment is needed to upgrade aging infrastructure, which will be funded by sharp increases in customer bills. The goal is to create a system that prioritizes long-term investment and resilience.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed that a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners, as well as the aftermath, which included the collapse of prosecutions against 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had unanswered questions for over 40 years. Campaigners, who have long called for an inquiry, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom may inadvertently benefit if the U.S. imposes its threatened 30% trade tariffs on the European Union. Having already secured a more favorable trade deal with the U.S. that includes lower tariffs, the UK could become an attractive manufacturing hub for EU companies looking to avoid the steep American levies. This situation presents a potential opportunity for Britain to regain some of the manufacturing capacity it lost after Brexit. However, some analysts are skeptical, noting that shifting production facilities is a long-term process and that the UK's primary strength lies in services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Assets under management in Chinese bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surged to over $50 billion, driven by investor demand for low-risk assets amid deflationary pressures and an uncertain economic outlook. These ETFs offer lower costs, diversification, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, which have expanded sixfold since last year, as investors seek higher yields than those available from government debt. This trend reflects a broader shift towards safer, fixed-income products as China's economy navigates trade frictions and weak domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

While the government has approved billions in tax relief and a major infrastructure fund, it emphasizes that private sector capital is essential for recovery. Germany, once Europe's economic engine, has been hit hard by inflation, high energy costs, and global competition, prompting this major push. (not investment advice)</p>
