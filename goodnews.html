        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest level in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability and stimulated buyer activity. Despite the rise in sales and a slight increase in inventory, the market remains tight, with the median home price climbing 2.1% year-over-year to $415,200. Persistently high prices continue to pose a challenge for many potential buyers, particularly at the lower end of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining high, financial planners suggest that now may be a strategic time for savers to lock in favorable yields before they potentially decline. Experts recommend allocating between 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, depending on individual financial goals and emergency fund needs. They advise against over-allocating, as other assets like stocks have historically provided better long-term returns against inflation. For those considering CDs, a laddering strategy—splitting deposits into accounts with different maturity dates—is suggested to maintain liquidity while capitalizing on strong short-term rates.

In a statement, Soros highlighted the centuries of marginalization the Roma have endured and reaffirmed his commitment to protecting the rights of excluded people.

          <p>Shares of several quantum-computing firms, including IonQ and D-Wave, surged following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking equity stakes in them in exchange for federal funding. This potential move aligns with a recent strategy of government investment in industries deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals. The administration argues that the government should share in the success of companies that benefit from public funds, particularly in sectors critical to the technological competition with China. Quantum computing is viewed as a strategically important technology with significant economic and security implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, a veteran with nearly three decades of experience in the airline industry, as its new senior vice president and chief commercial officer. The move comes as the carrier seeks to improve its profitability, which has been trailing behind competitors like Delta and United. Pieper previously held high-level roles at Delta and Alaska Airlines and most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance. His appointment follows the ousting of the previous commercial chief, whose strategy for business travel had backfired and led to a sharp drop in revenue projections.</p>

          <h2>New Tax Law Offers More Lucrative Exit Strategy for Small Business Owners</h2>

          <p>A new tax law enacted in July has significantly enhanced the benefits of qualified small business stock (QSBS), providing a more lucrative way for entrepreneurs on Main Street to cash out. The legislation raises the tax-free gain cap from $10 million to $15 million for qualifying C corporations and reduces the required stock holding period from five to three years. These changes make the tax advantages accessible to more businesses, especially those considering a sale in the near future. While converting to a C corporation has downsides like double taxation, the potential tax savings could amount to millions for eligible owners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite earlier tensions over trade, relations between the United States and the European Union have reportedly grown closer due to a shared frustration with Russia's refusal to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. This week, Washington and Brussels announced complementary sanctions targeting Russia's vital oil and gas industry, demonstrating a united front. U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Andrew Puzder, stated that both sides are aligned on the need to increase pressure on Moscow. The coordinated action follows President Trump's cancellation of a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, signaling a tougher stance from his administration.</p>

          <p>England has won its T20 series against New Zealand 1-0 after the third and final match in Auckland was abandoned due to rain, with only 3.4 overs played. This follows the first match also being heavily impacted by weather, leaving England's dominant 65-run victory in the second game as the decisive result. Captain Harry Brook described the tour as "very worthwhile" despite the limited playtime, emphasizing the benefits of team bonding activities off the field. The series serves as part of the team's preparation for the T20 World Cup in February, with a three-match ODI series against the Black Caps set to begin on Sunday.</p>

          <h2>Film Review: 'The Mastermind' Deconstructs the Hubris of an Inept Art Thief</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 09:34:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kelly Reichardt's latest film, "The Mastermind," offers a methodical and often humorous character study of a clumsy art thief whose grand ambitions quickly unravel. Set in 1970s Massachusetts, the movie follows J. B. Mooney (Josh O'Connor), an unemployed carpenter who masterminds a poorly conceived plan to steal paintings from a local museum. Rather than focusing on the heist itself, the film explores the chaotic aftermath as J. B.'s selfish and impulsive actions lead him down a path of self-destruction. The film contrasts its patient, atmospheric style with its protagonist's reckless nature to deliver a precise exploration of middle-class malaise and unearned confidence.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard from Naushon Island off Cape Cod after their boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to shore. The family took shelter in a barn for nearly two days before the son was able to use the boat's marine radio, which had washed ashore, to make a mayday call. A relative had initiated a search after the family failed to return as scheduled. The three individuals were airlifted to a local hospital, with one reported to be in critical condition, highlighting the importance of their quick thinking and reliable equipment in ensuring their survival.</p>
