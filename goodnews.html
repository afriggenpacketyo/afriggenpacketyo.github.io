          <p>Following a strong debut on Wall Street, financial technology company Klarna is still considered a buying opportunity by CNBC's Jim Cramer. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" firm saw its stock climb after pricing its IPO above the expected range, reaching a valuation over $17 billion. Cramer noted that while the company is not yet profitable, it has demonstrated strong growth, shrinking losses, and impressive underwriting standards. He suggested that the success of publicly traded competitors like Affirm bodes well for Klarna's future potential, though he cautioned that many shares were sold by existing investors rather than the company itself.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State lawmakers have introduced legislation to significantly alter Measure ULA, a Los Angeles property sales tax intended to fund homelessness programs. The proposed changes, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, aim to address criticisms that the tax has stifled housing construction by reducing the levy on newly built apartment buildings and commercial properties. This legislative move is also part of a broader strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to limit local tax hikes and would nullify Measure ULA entirely. The proposal has created a rift, with some ULA supporters arguing it undermines the will of voters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional "stand and stir" television cooking shows are experiencing a sharp decline, with major broadcasters like the BBC commissioning zero new half-hour programs this year. This article suggests the genre's downfall is linked to the boom in food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, which offer more authentic, nimble, and direct engagement with audiences. Online creators can react instantly to trends, like the "cronut" craze, in a way that the slow, heavily regulated world of television production cannot. The shift reflects a broader cultural change where audiences, particularly younger viewers, increasingly prefer the "rough and ready" feel of online videos over polished television programming.</p>

          <p>A top White House official has emphasized the need for the United States to defend its lead in artificial intelligence against rapid advancements from China. Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the competitive gap has narrowed significantly since 2020 and that the U.S. is in danger of losing its preeminence. He advocated for exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to allied nations. This strategy aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to ensure American technology sets the international standard, reinforcing U.S. strategic and economic interests.</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor announced a major leadership shake-up, naming former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The news was met with strong investor enthusiasm, causing the company's stock to jump over 30% in extended trading. The changes follow the recent resignation of the previous CEO amid pressure from activist investors, including Rabois. This move marks a pivotal moment for the company, which had previously faced the risk of being delisted but has recently seen a surge in interest from retail investors.</p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating the "dark DNA" of Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, which includes over 100 different species. Unlike genes, which have known functions, dark DNA comprises the mysterious parts of the genetic code whose purpose is largely unknown. Scientists hypothesize that this genetic material, which is three times more abundant in peacock spiders than in humans, may enable the creatures to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. This research is part of the broader Earth BioGenome Project, which aims to decode the DNA of all life on Earth.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The bipartisan measure, supported by both Democrats and 49 Republicans, reflects a growing effort in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Proponents argue that these decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military actions without new congressional approval. The amendment is attached to the annual defense spending bill, and its passage marks a significant step in the long-running debate over presidential war powers.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to early data from the CDC for 2024. After peaking as the third leading cause of death in 2021, it has steadily moved down the list, though it remains a significant health threat. Overall U.S. death rates declined for the third consecutive year, with heart disease and cancer remaining the top two causes. Health officials note that while this marks progress against infectious diseases, the focus remains on tackling chronic conditions influenced by behavior, environment, and genetics.</p>

The visit also includes official talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers and a traditional state banquet at Windsor. While the visit underscores the diplomatic relationship, it is also expected to draw protests from groups opposed to the U.S. president's policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily allowed a transgender male student in South Carolina to continue using the boys' restroom at his school. The court declined an emergency request from state officials to block a lower court's ruling that prevented the enforcement of a state ban against the student while his legal challenge proceeds. In its unsigned order, the court clarified that this decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case itself. The case is part of a larger national legal battle over the rights of transgender students in public schools.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the U.S. Forest Service will now allow and provide N95 masks to federal firefighters battling wildfires. For decades, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, despite growing evidence of long-term health risks from smoke inhalation, including cancer. The decision follows criticism from lawmakers and health advocates, who pointed out that other countries provide such protection without issue. This change is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the serious health hazards associated with wildfire smoke and a crucial step toward better protecting firefighter health.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker has won the award for best TV presenter at the UK's National Television Awards, ending the record-breaking 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec. The former footballer, who recently left the BBC's "Match of the Day" after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award by saying it "demonstrates that it is OK to use your platform to speak up." Lineker's departure from the BBC followed controversies surrounding his social media use. In other notable wins, the finale of the popular sitcom "Gavin and Stacey" won in the comedy category.</p>

          <p>Larry Ellison, the co-founder of software giant Oracle, briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest person. Ellison's net worth surged to $393 billion after Oracle's stock soared more than 40%, driven by a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. The company reported a significant increase in demand for its data centers, securing several multibillion-dollar contracts. Although a slight dip in Oracle's share price later in the day returned Musk to the top spot, the event highlighted the massive wealth being generated by the AI boom.</p>
