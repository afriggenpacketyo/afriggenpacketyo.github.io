        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to document five weekly accomplishments, a practice initiated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. OPM Director Scott Kupor stated that managers have other tools to stay informed about their teams' work and the agency will no longer manage the process. The directive, issued in February as part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce, had been met with resistance from multiple agencies. The policy was largely phased out after Musk, who had threatened termination for non-compliance, left his government role in May.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime rates in the United States decreased across every measured category in 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murders. Violent crime overall fell by 4.5%, and property crime, including a significant 18.6% reduction in motor vehicle thefts, also saw a substantial decline. While experts note this continues a downward trend from post-pandemic highs, they also point out that aggravated assaults remain elevated compared to pre-2020 levels. The report reflects a broad improvement in public safety statistics, though hate crime incidents saw only a slight decrease.</p>

In corporate news, a surge in global mergers and acquisitions has benefited investment banks, with Goldman Sachs leading the rankings and Wells Fargo significantly improving its position. The rebound in large-scale dealmaking signals a positive shift for the financial sector, which is diversifying revenue streams amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Roku has launched a new commercial-free streaming service named Howdy for $2.99 per month, marking a strategic shift for the company known for its free, ad-supported content. The service will feature 10,000 hours of movies and TV shows from partners like Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, alongside Roku's own original programming. This new subscription tier is designed to complement, rather than compete with, premium services and will run alongside the existing free Roku Channel. The move represents an expansion of Roku's business model as it seeks to capture a wider audience in the competitive streaming market.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a recent conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump as "productive," focusing on potential sanctions against Russia and enhanced defense cooperation. The discussion comes as Trump's Friday deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant secondary sanctions on its trading partners. Zelenskyy noted Moscow is particularly "sensitive" to this prospect. The dialogue signals a mending of relations between the two leaders, following a period of tension, and aligns with Trump's increasing impatience over the lack of progress toward ending the war.</p>

          <p>Following the closure of Skydance Media's $8.4 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, the newly formed company has named its 10-member board of directors. Skydance's David Ellison will serve as chairman, joined by prominent figures including Oracle CEO Safra Catz and former Paramount Pictures chair Sherry Lansing. The board's composition reflects the new ownership structure, with heavy representation from financial backers The Larry Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners. This marks a major leadership transition for the legacy entertainment company, with only one member from the previous Paramount board remaining.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have collectively committed to purchasing over $1 billion in U.S. weapons to be sent to Ukraine. This arrangement follows a new policy supported by President Trump, allowing NATO allies to buy American arms and transfer them to Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the nations for the assistance, which includes crucial components for U.S. Patriot air defense systems. The deal marks a sign of improving U.S.-Ukraine relations and provides a new avenue for military support as Ukraine continues to defend against escalating Russian airstrikes.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to wildlife management, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly using audio from a heated argument scene in the film "Marriage Story" to haze wolves and prevent them from attacking cattle in Oregon. According to the Wall Street Journal, the agency deploys drones that, upon detecting wolves, shine spotlights and blast alarming sounds, including the dramatic dialogue between actors Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. This unusual tactic is part of a broader "wolf hazing" strategy that also uses sounds of fireworks and gunshots. Early results suggest the method has been effective in reducing livestock predation.</p>
