          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has traveled to Spain to finalize a season-long loan agreement with Barcelona. The deal, which includes an option for a permanent transfer, progressed quickly after the 27-year-old expressed his desire for a new challenge. Rashford is expected to undergo a medical this week, potentially joining Barcelona's pre-season tour in Asia. The move follows a previous loan spell at Aston Villa and has been supported by former teammate Paul Pogba.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," the leader of the violent "Los Choneros" drug gang, to the United States. Macías, who had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His organization is known for its use of hitmen, bribery, and smuggling military-grade weapons to control trafficking routes with the help of Mexican cartels. The extradition proceeded after the U.S. provided guarantees regarding the 45-year-old's rights.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology and the National University of Singapore has developed a novel nanovaccine. In animal trials, the bio-inspired vaccine successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis by targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). These cells are responsible for tumor growth and self-renewal, making them a difficult therapeutic target. The findings, published in Nature Nanotechnology, suggest a promising new avenue for developing personalized cancer vaccines.</p>

          <p>Venture capitalists (VCs) widely employ the "power law" principle, which posits that a small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's returns. This means VCs seek startups with "outsized-outcome potential," as one massive success can outweigh all other losses combined. The article advises founders to pitch a compelling vision of how their company can become a category-defining entity. It also notes that European founders could improve by adopting more visionary storytelling, a trait more common among their U.S. counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare-earth magnets to the United States surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade agreement that eased some restrictions. These magnets are critical components for high-tech industries, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, and China dominates over 90% of the global market. The increase in shipments is expected to alleviate shortages that have impacted various sectors, from auto-parts to robotics. This development underscores China's significant leverage in the global supply chain for these essential materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed the most significant reforms since its privatization 30 years ago. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report includes 88 recommendations, such as abolishing the current regulator, Ofwat, and implementing stronger environmental rules. The proposals aim to tackle chronic underinvestment, which has led to leaking pipes and sewage spills, by requiring minimum capital levels and blocking inappropriate dividend payouts. While these changes are intended to improve the system, they will be funded by over £100 billion in investment, leading to inevitably higher water bills for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has officially announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. It will also examine the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what the Home Secretary called "discredited evidence."

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, as Chinese-led infrastructure projects are nearing completion. For years, logistical challenges, specifically the lack of railways connecting mines to ports, have hindered exports from both African nations. In Guinea, the massive Simandou iron ore project, jointly developed by Rio Tinto and Chinese firms, is expected to start shipments in November. Similarly, a new railway will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara to Mediterranean ports, unlocking a major new supply source for China.</p>

Some researchers and patients report that the drugs, by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, can also regulate menstrual cycles and reduce other PCOS symptoms.
