          <p>WNBA player Paige Bueckers expressed her surprise and faith after the Dallas Mavericks won the NBA Draft lottery, despite having low odds. Bueckers, who was the top pick in the WNBA Draft, believes that "God makes no mistakes" and that there was a reason for the Mavericks' good fortune. The Mavericks, with only a 1.8% chance, secured the top selection for the upcoming draft, where Duke standout Cooper Flagg is expected to be the first pick. This article highlights Bueckers' perspective on the unexpected event and her trust in divine intervention. </p>

          <p>China-Philippine relations are facing a potential shift as President Marcos' efforts to diminish the Duterte political camp have been unsuccessful. Sara Duterte, likely to survive an impeachment trial, is positioned to be a strong candidate in the 2028 presidential election, potentially leading to improved China-Philippines ties. Preliminary results from midterm elections indicate that Duterte's allies are poised to secure enough Senate seats to shield her from conviction, preserving her eligibility for the 2028 race. This article suggests that Marcos' failure to eliminate the Duterte dynasty's power could lead to a change in the Philippines' approach to China. </p>

          <p>While some Afrikaners have taken up President Trump's offer to resettle in the US as refugees, many others are choosing to remain in South Africa, expressing pride in their heritage and a commitment to contributing to the country's future. Trump's offer, based on claims of persecution and genocide against white Afrikaners, has sparked debate and controversy. Some Afrikaners feel unsafe due to high crime rates and government policies aimed at reducing economic inequality, while others argue that the claims of persecution are exaggerated. This article explores the differing views within the Afrikaner community regarding Trump's offer and the broader issue of their status in South Africa. </p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision, which the Los Angeles County District Attorney opposed, was described as monumental with significant implications. If approved, the case will go to the California Board of Parole Hearings and then to the governor's office, potentially leading to their release. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new legislation. This decision follows a previous ban on foreign-state ownership after a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes aim to protect "media plurality" while enabling publishers to secure vital funding. Ministers believe a 15% threshold for State Owned Investors is the most effective and proportionate approach. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills designed to streamline housing development in urban areas, emphasizing the need to cut red tape and address the state's housing crisis. Newsom's revised budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and clear other impediments to new housing construction. The governor praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Senator Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills that would ease the permitting process for infill projects, aiming to accelerate urban development and exempt projects from CEQA regulations. </p>

          <p>NASA engineers have successfully revived long-dormant thrusters on Voyager 1, the spacecraft farthest from Earth, averting a potential communications blackout. The fix to the vehicle‚Äôs original roll thrusters, which had been out of action since 2004, was crucial before upgrades to an Earth-based antenna temporarily cut off communication with the probe. The revival of these thrusters ensures Voyager 1 can maintain its orientation and continue sending back data from interstellar space. This article highlights the ingenuity and risk-taking involved in fixing broken equipment on a spacecraft billions of miles away. </p>

          <p>Santa Monica's City Council has approved a proposal to turn the Third Street Promenade into an "entertainment zone" by allowing visitors to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages outdoors. The initiative aims to revitalize the commercial district, which has experienced declining foot traffic since 2019. The "Entertainment Zone" will operate on Fridays through Sundays, requiring participants to be 21 or older and wear wristbands. While supporters believe the proposal will boost local businesses, some residents have raised concerns about potential issues such as crime and homelessness. </p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking a positive shift in the fight against the opioid crisis. However, this progress is threatened by proposed funding cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing drug addiction, by the Trump administration. While the CDC praised President Trump's efforts, experts warn that these cuts could undermine the momentum gained in reducing drug-related fatalities. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, underscoring the need for continued investment in prevention, treatment, and support services. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez has brought the culture and politics of the 1990s under scrutiny, as their lawyers argued that the era's punitive criminal justice policies contributed to their life sentences. The Menendez brothers' case, which became a media sensation in the 1990s, was influenced by factors such as the Rodney King riots and the O.J. Simpson trial. The defense argued that today's more rehabilitative approach to criminal justice warrants a second chance for the brothers, who have demonstrated exemplary behavior in prison. </p>
