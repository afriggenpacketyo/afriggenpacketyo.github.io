          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. While the exact amount of Liverpool's bid has not been confirmed, it reportedly falls short of Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million. Isak, who was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, is said to be exploring a potential move and is currently training alone. Liverpool manager Arne Slot is keen on adding the Sweden international to his squad before the start of the new season, but it remains uncertain if an improved offer will be made.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% drop in its second-quarter net income, which fell to $2.49 billion, impacted by lower crude oil prices and a financial loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the overall profit decline, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.77 beat Wall Street estimates. The oil major achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output seeing an 8% jump. The completed Hess acquisition is expected to boost earnings starting in the fourth quarter and contribute to a goal of $1 billion in annual cost reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings surpassed analyst expectations, even as net income fell 23% to $7.1 billion compared to the previous year. The company's strong performance was driven by record production levels, particularly in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which helped mitigate the impact of lower global oil prices. Exxon achieved its highest second-quarter output in over 25 years, pumping 4.6 million barrels per day. The company also continued its focus on shareholder returns, distributing $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks, while making progress on its long-term cost-cutting initiatives.

          <p>Richard Masters, the chief executive of the Premier League, has firmly stated that the league will not be reducing its size from 20 to 18 clubs. This declaration comes amidst growing tensions with FIFA over an increasingly congested international football calendar, which has raised concerns about player burnout. Masters argued against being forced into such a decision to accommodate the expansion of global competitions like the Club World Cup. He emphasized the importance of protecting domestic football and criticized FIFA for a lack of proper dialogue with stakeholders regarding the scheduling changes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the terminations until at least November, providing a reprieve for individuals who have lived in the U.S. for over two decades. TPS is granted to migrants from countries facing conditions, such as natural disasters or armed conflict, that prevent their safe return. Hondurans and Nicaraguans first received this status in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch, while Nepal was added following a 2015 earthquake.</p>

Under the new rule, dealers must report any cash transactions totaling 100,000 yuan (about US$13,870) or more within a single day to the country's financial crime watchdog. This marks the first time China has extended its anti-money-laundering supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector. The measure is designed to close a loophole that allowed for illicit funds to be moved through high-value, easily transportable assets like gold and jewels.</p>

          <p>The strict 100-milliliter limit on liquids in airline carry-on luggage may soon be eliminated at European Union airports, following the approval of new advanced security scanners. These devices use medical-grade CT imaging to create detailed 3D visuals of bag contents, allowing security to detect liquid explosives without passengers removing items. While the EU Commission has authorized airports to lift the rule, the implementation will be gradual as hubs across the continent install the new technology. Some German airports may soon permit up to two liters of liquids, but for now, travelers are advised to adhere to existing restrictions.</p>

After two of the company's married executives were caught in an intimate moment on a concert kiss-cam, Paltrow appeared in a promotional video cleverly addressing the scandal while promoting the company's services. The video went viral, turning a moment of public shame into a significant marketing victory for the previously obscure company.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union will begin phasing out traditional passport stamps in favor of a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES) starting October 12. Under the new rules, non-EU travelers, including those from the UK, will need to have their fingerprints and facial images scanned to cross an EU border. This data will be registered and remain valid for three years, intended to streamline future crossings. The system aims to enhance border security, but it has raised concerns about potential initial delays, with the UK government warning travelers to be prepared for longer wait times during the rollout period.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has sold his remaining equity stake and stepped down from the firm's board. This move completes a leadership transition that began in 2022, formally ending his management role at the company he founded in 1975. Dalio will continue to be a significant investor in Bridgewater's funds and will serve as a mentor to the firm's leadership. The final sale of his ownership was facilitated by raising capital from existing investors and employees, with co-CIOs Bob Prince and Greg Jensen now being major equity holders.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Having an emergency fund significantly reduces the likelihood that individuals will tap into their 401(k) retirement savings prematurely, according to new research from Vanguard. The study found that investors with at least $2,000 in a rainy-day fund are much less likely to take out 401(k) loans or make hardship withdrawals. This is particularly crucial for hourly workers, who have more volatile incomes and are more prone to early withdrawals. Experts emphasize that these emergency funds act as a vital buffer, preventing the long-term damage to retirement security caused by so-called "leakage" from retirement plans.

          <p>In an effort to increase social mobility within Whitehall, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will then be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service. The move, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves, though it has drawn criticism for what some call "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>In a novel anti-poaching initiative, scientists at South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand are injecting rhino horns with a harmless radioactive material. The project, called Rhisotope, makes the horns detectable by customs radiation scanners installed at borders and ports worldwide, aiming to disrupt smuggling networks. After six years of research, tests have confirmed the process is safe for the animals but effective in tracking the illicit trade. South Africa, home to the world's largest rhino population, hopes this innovative technology can help protect the threatened species from the hundreds that are poached annually.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a federal shift away from renewable energy subsidies under the Trump administration, Southern California is continuing to invest heavily in green hydrogen as a key part of its decarbonization strategy. A major new hydrogen production and dispensing facility is under construction in Vernon, aiming to power heavy-duty trucks and reduce significant carbon emissions. While federal tax incentives for hydrogen are set to expire, project developers are relying on state-level regulations and grants to move forward. This highlights California's commitment to its climate goals, even as hydrogen's energy-intensive nature and historical links to fossil fuels remain points of controversy.</p>
