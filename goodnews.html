          <p>Former Wales rugby international Jamie Roberts, 38, is set to begin his medical training as a junior doctor in the NHS, twelve years after graduating from Cardiff University's school of medicine. Roberts, who earned 94 caps for Wales and was a British and Irish Lion, balanced his medical studies with his rugby career, even sitting his final exams during a Six Nations tournament. He completed postgraduate degrees at Loughborough University and Cambridge University, and now aims to specialize in sports medicine or orthopaedics, inspired by his own injuries, as he follows in the footsteps of other Welsh rugby players who have become doctors. Roberts expresses excitement and respect for the NHS, ready to face the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how Beijing is adopting a flexible approach in courting Taiwan's allies, as evidenced by the attendance of delegations from Haiti and St Lucia at a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan, these Caribbean nations participated in the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum, signaling a pragmatic approach to diplomacy. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that the two countries had informed them in advance and that relations remained friendly and stable, suggesting that economic and regional interests may be driving this engagement with mainland China.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's MLB-leading 16th home run was not enough to secure a win for the Dodgers as they lost to the Angels 6-2. Despite Ohtani's performance, the Dodgers struggled offensively, hitting into five double plays, matching a franchise record. Angels pitcher Jack Kochanowicz held the Dodgers to one run through 6 2/3 innings, while Dodgers pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up four runs in five innings. The Angels capitalized on their opportunities, with key hits from Zach Neto, Yo√°n Moncada, and Nolan Schanuel, securing the win over their Southern California rivals.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report that raised concerns about his mental acuity, just months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from the 2023 interview revealed Biden struggling to remember key dates, including his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected. In February 2024, when questioned about Hur's description of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," Biden retorted that he knew what he was doing and didn't need the special counsel's recommendation. The report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, ultimately contributing to his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting a ground stop at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so, and the first time including the city itself. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois. While skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas, the event was described as "something out of the history books."</p>

          <p>President Trump's whirlwind tour of the Middle East was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethics concerns. In Saudi Arabia, he received a standing ovation for announcing the lifting of sanctions on Syria; in Qatar, he secured billions in investment pledges; and in the UAE, he was awarded the country's highest civilian honor. Trump touted over $2 trillion in economic investments from the three nations and was surrounded by friendly audiences, turning events into campaign-style rallies. The trip was intended to deliver economic, diplomatic, and public relations wins, with Gulf leaders echoing Trump's slogans and praising his shift away from judgment and confrontation.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is using its wealth and influence to fill the void. Since 2019, Emirati firms have announced $110 billion worth of deals in Africa, focusing on key economic and strategic spots such as ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. This expansion is part of an ambitious plan to increase the UAE‚Äôs influence over global supply chains and diversify its economy away from fossil fuels. While the US reduces its presence, the UAE's investments and efforts align with a broader trend towards business-focused approaches in Africa.</p>
