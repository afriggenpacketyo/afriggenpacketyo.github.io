          <h2>China Develops Stable Fiber-Optic Gyroscope for Enhanced Navigation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 00:00:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have engineered a "groundbreaking" fiber-optic gyroscope that maintains stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. Developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, this gyroscope offers a more reliable method for measuring orientation and turning rates without external signals like satellites. Inertial navigation systems utilizing this technology are immune to interference, crucial for military and security applications. Interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs) are already used in aerospace, weapons systems, oil platforms, and autonomous vehicles due to their simple structure and high resolution. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>High demand for live shows in China, exemplified by sold-out comedy shows in Hong Kong and Coldplay concerts, is fueling a tourism spending spree. Fans are purchasing travel packages that include airport transfers and guaranteed bookings. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings to boost domestic consumption, aligning with Beijing's economic agenda. This strategy aims to encourage people to spend more than just the ticket price, with concertgoers traveling across the country for unique experiences. For instance, one fan received a 50% discount to a mountain after presenting her concert ticket. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene‚Äîbloody, bare footprints‚Äîled to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators discovered the victim had been stabbed more than 60 times, and the footprints were identified as belonging to the killer. Years later, forensic scientist Andrea Feia discovered an unknown DNA profile repeating itself throughout the crime scene. This DNA was eventually matched to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy, leading to his arrest and subsequent conviction. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, asserting that the company should absorb the costs instead. Walmart, the nation‚Äôs largest retailer, had indicated that even reduced tariff levels would soon lead to price increases. Trump called on Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" and maintain lower prices for consumers. This exchange highlights the tension between the administration's trade policies and their impact on businesses and consumers, with Walmart emphasizing its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible despite rising costs. </p>

          <p>The government is reportedly developing plans to have convicted criminals fill potholes and clean bins as part of an expansion of unpaid work programs. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to make punishment more than a "soft option" by having offenders work for free, with their earnings going to victim's groups. Probation teams would collaborate with councils to assign jobs to offenders, and private companies could also employ those on community sentences. This initiative seeks to ensure that crime doesn't pay and that offenders contribute to public services. </p>

          <p>A local government in China has detailed the punishment of a young man who refused to serve in the military due to personal preference, aiming to deter potential military service dodgers. The 20-year-old, surnamed Liu, voluntarily signed up but repeatedly requested to leave, leading to his expulsion from the army. Liu is now banned from civil service jobs, faces a fine of 38,000 yuan, and is restricted from traveling abroad, studying, opening a business, or receiving preferential loans for two years.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day to night and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous road conditions. The storm, driven by high winds from thunderstorms, reduced visibility to near-zero levels, particularly affecting major highways and Chicago's Midway International Airport. Meteorologists noted that the soil moisture in the area was exceptionally low, contributing to the severity of the dust storm.
