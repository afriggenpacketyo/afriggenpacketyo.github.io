          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez are celebrating their marriage in Venice, Italy, drawing a high-profile crowd of celebrities and business leaders. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian were seen attending a pre-wedding reception at the Madonna dell'Orto church. The lavish events, expected to host around 200 guests, have sparked protests from some Venice locals concerned about the impact of "over-tourism" and the city being used as a playground for the super-rich. The main ceremony is scheduled for the weekend at a private location.</p>

          <p>The wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez in Venice is a three-day affair with an estimated cost of around $50 million, featuring a star-studded guest list. The main reception is set to be held in the historic Arsenale complex, following a black-tie ceremony on a private island. The extravagant celebration, which includes booking out several luxury hotels for guests, has drawn criticism from local residents and environmentalists protesting the use of the UNESCO World Heritage site for such displays of wealth.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, many retirees are exploring annuities for guaranteed income, with current high interest rates making them more attractive. A $300,000 immediate fixed annuity purchased at age 65 could yield different monthly payouts depending on various factors. For example, a 65-year-old man might receive around $1,942 per month, while a woman of the same age might get about $1,861, due to longer life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would typically pay less, around $1,684, as it covers two lives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Supreme Court Ruling on Birthright Citizenship Injunctions is More Nuanced Than It Appears</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 11:05:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision in the Trump birthright citizenship case was a narrow procedural victory for the administration, focusing on the use of nationwide injunctions rather than the legality of the policy itself. The ruling restricts the ability of single judges to block a policy nationwide but leaves the door open for such injunctions if they are necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs. This analysis suggests the decision is not a death blow to birthright citizenship, as challenges can continue through other legal means, and it may also benefit future administrations by curbing judicial overreach.</p>

          <p>With auto insurance rates rising significantly, many drivers are wondering when to switch providers. Industry experts suggest shopping for new insurance not just for a better price, but also when seeking different coverage options like roadside assistance or new car replacement. Another key reason to switch is a desire for better customer service or if you are working with a "captive" agent who can only offer policies from one company. Experts recommend getting at least three quotes to compare value, which includes coverage, price, and the insurer's service and claims reputation.</p>

A fact-check finds these claims to be false. Mamdani has a history of working with Jewish politicians, has been endorsed by them, and has publicly condemned antisemitism. Furthermore, his progressive platform, which includes strong support for LGBTQIA+ rights and reproductive freedom, directly contradicts the principles of Sharia law.
