          <p>Following President Trump's threat of imposing 50% tariffs on EU goods, the European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade deal based on mutual respect rather than threats. Several European leaders, including Ireland's Taoiseach and France's Foreign Minister, voiced concerns over the potential damage from higher tariffs and advocated for continued negotiations. The EU remains dedicated to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, highlighting the importance of the EU-US trade relationship which involves over $600 billion in goods sent from the EU to the US annually.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting it will generate 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion economic boost.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time over career advancement and higher pay, a departure from previous generations' dedication to employers. A study indicates that 45% of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are doing the bare minimum at their jobs. This shift is attributed to a desire for better work-life balance and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation. The trend also reflects changing attitudes towards job security and company loyalty amid economic shifts.</p>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a stylish and gritty comedy about a young housewife's urban malaise in Mumbai. Uma, a woman in an arranged marriage, begins to explore the city at night, leading to unexpected encounters and a transformation. The film is a visually striking and blackly funny exploration of a woman's search for identity. It is an inventive and unmanageable fever of a movie that shares its name.</p>
