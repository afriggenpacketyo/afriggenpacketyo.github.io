          <p>England's goalkeeper Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football just weeks before the Lionesses begin their European Championship defense. The 32-year-old played a vital role in England's Euro 2022 victory but had recently lost her starting position. Earps made 53 senior appearances over eight years, winning the 2023 Women's Finalissima and reaching the 2023 Women's World Cup final. She expressed that this is the right time for her to step aside and allow the younger generation to thrive, while also rooting for the team to win again this summer.</p>

          <p>Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina, has voiced agreement with President Trump's assessment of Vladimir Putin as "crazy," while advocating for stronger support for Ukraine. Wilson called for secondary sanctions and arms support for Ukraine to help them repel Russia's invasion. This statement follows Trump's Truth Social post where he also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, urging him to stop causing problems. Wilson's support for Ukraine is part of a bipartisan effort, with a coalition of senators supporting sanctions measures, as Zelenskyy also advocates for increased sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. increased by an estimated 76% in April year-on-year, while shipments from China fell by about 76%. This surge reflects Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing base amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. However, analysts predict that this growth may plateau due to limitations in India's manufacturing capacity. The Trump administration's tariffs continue to impact iPhones imported from China, while iPhones from India face a lower baseline tariff rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Abigail Leonard's new book, *Four Mothers*, compares the experiences of mothers in Japan, Kenya, Finland, and the US, revealing significant disparities in support systems. The US is the only wealthy nation without national paid leave, and childbirth costs are significantly higher compared to other countries. Leonard argues that pronatalist policies, aimed at increasing birth rates, are not the same as being pro-woman, emphasizing the need for extensive support like affordable maternity care and childcare. The book highlights how government policies greatly affect parents' lives, making parenthood much harder in the US due to privatization and limited government aid.</p>

          <p>King Charles II addressed Canada's Parliament, a rare event amid tensions with President Trump, who has mused about annexing Canada. The visit is viewed as a pushback against Trump's comments and a sign of solidarity with Canada's sovereignty. The speech from the throne, written by Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, outlined the government's agenda. This gesture highlights the unique relationship between Canada and the British monarchy, especially amid strained relations with the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was rapidly carved 2.1 million years ago when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow. Researchers analyzed ancient river sediments found inside caves within the canyon. The findings indicate the canyon emerged when a huge lake in present-day Idaho drained away, leading to a "fill and spill" episode. This makes Hells Canyon younger than the Grand Canyon, whose youngest stretches are about 5 million years old.</p>

          <p>Josh Newman, a candidate for California's state superintendent of public instruction, argues that the position should be an appointed expert rather than an elected politician. He notes that the superintendent's responsibilities have been reduced over the years, focusing more on technical administration than direct oversight of schools. Newman contends that appointing an experienced administrator would improve accountability and coordination between the executive branch and the Legislature. He suggests that this change is needed to address California's lack of progress in improving learning conditions and student outcomes, despite increased per-student spending.</p>
