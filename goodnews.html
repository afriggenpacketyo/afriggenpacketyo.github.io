          <p>Romania is holding a high-stakes presidential election between George Simion, a hard-right 'sovereignist' with pro-Russian leanings, and Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU liberal. Simion's victory could trigger a crisis in the European Union, given Romania's strategic importance as the sixth largest EU country and its role in NATO. Simion, who won the first round, has shifted his tone recently but remains anti-Ukrainian, while Dan stands for the rule of law and support for Ukraine. The outcome is difficult to predict, but the election is considered a historic decision for Romania.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise, lacking specifics on which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. The new Syrian government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges and rebuild the war-ravaged country. While some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, the breadth and timing of Trump's announcement were unexpected. The administration is now determining how to implement the president's directive.</p>
