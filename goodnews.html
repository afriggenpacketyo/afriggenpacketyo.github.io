          <p>Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results, missing earnings-per-share estimates but exceeding revenue expectations. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and a 3.4% same-store sales growth at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, marking it as a laggard in the portfolio. CEO Josh Kobza noted a modest improvement in the consumer environment and reiterated the company's full-year forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has narrowly voted to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4.25% to 4%. The 5-4 decision reflects a deep division among policymakers, who are balancing persistent inflation against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. One policymaker even voted for a larger 50-basis-point cut before a majority was reached in a second round of voting. Governor Andrew Bailey stressed a continued "gradual and careful" approach, suggesting future rate cuts are not guaranteed and will depend on disinflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has sent its first official delegation to Damascus to engage with Syria's new provisional government, signaling a pragmatic foreign policy shift. The meetings, led by a senior official from India's Ministry of External Affairs, focused on humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and bilateral cooperation. This outreach is seen as a strategic move to ensure India is not sidelined in the post-Assad era and to promote regional stability. Experts note the move aligns with India's non-aligned stance and its interest in securing trade routes and energy corridors in West Asia.</p>

The survey found that 69% of companies now monitor attendance, a significant jump from 45% last year, while 37% are actively enforcing their policies. Despite high overall office vacancy rates, a majority of companies plan to maintain or expand their office footprints over the next three years.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) plans. This move would open the door for investments in cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate within tax-advantaged retirement accounts governed by ERISA. The initiative is seen as a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for access to the trillions of dollars held in defined-contribution plans. The news prompted a jump in Bitcoin's price and a rise in private equity stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2025 guidance after reporting second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street estimates. The strong performance was driven by soaring demand for its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, and weight loss treatment, Zepbound, which generated a combined $8.58 billion in revenue. Despite the positive results, the company's stock dipped after late-stage trial data for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, fell short of expectations. The company's outlook accounts for existing tariffs but not potential future levies on pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to former President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on semiconductors, major global chipmakers are emphasizing their substantial investments in U.S. manufacturing. Companies like TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix, which have collectively pledged billions of dollars for new facilities in states like Arizona and Texas, are expected to avoid the levy. The policy is designed to exempt companies that are building or have committed to building in the U.S. Consequently, U.S.-headquartered firms like GlobalFoundries and tech giants like Apple and Nvidia, which are expanding their domestic supply chains, are also seen as beneficiaries.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has issued a contract request to purchase two Tesla Cybertrucks for use in "live missile fire testing" at White Sands Missile Range. According to procurement documents, the move is prompted by the assessment that adversaries are "likely" to begin using the durable, stainless-steel vehicles on the battlefield. The justification notes that the Cybertruck does not sustain the "normal extent of damage expected upon major impact." This unique military interest highlights the vehicle's unconventional design and the Air Force's need to understand how to effectively neutralize it as a potential threat.</p>

          <p>This cultural analysis explores the history and psychology of survivalism, from its far-right origins in the 1970s to its modern-day "prepper" boom among tech billionaires. The article contrasts the heroic "survivor" archetype, who seeks to rejoin civilization, with the "survivalist," who often craves societal collapse. It examines how fiction, from "Lord of the Flies" to "The Road," has shaped and critiqued this mindset, which often promotes a bleak, Hobbesian view of humanity. The essay argues that while these stories are compelling, they often overlook the powerful human instinct for mutual aid and solidarity that emerges in real-world disasters.</p>

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China needs to maintain an annual GDP growth rate of at least 4.5% to achieve its 2035 development goals. Writing in the Study Times, professor Cui Youping stated that a rate of "around 5 percent" would be ideal for reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country," a key political target. This economic benchmark, equivalent to around $30,000 per capita, requires sustained growth over the upcoming 15th five-year plan. The article also emphasized technological advancement and improving livelihoods as other national priorities. (not investment advice)</p>
