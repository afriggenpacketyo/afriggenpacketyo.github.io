          <p>The U.S. State Department, under Secretary Marco Rubio, has announced a plan to deliver "life-saving" Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) to 1.4 million starving children. This announcement follows questions from lawmakers about the agency's commitment to RUTF aid after USAID merged into the State Department. The department has approved an additional $50 million for RUTFs and is working with non-profit producers MANA and Edesia. Despite earlier concerns about contract freezes, MANA CEO Mark Moore indicated that the situation is improving, averting potential closures due to contract expirations.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that corporate leaders are increasingly optimistic about the U.S. economy, with most CEOs not expecting a recession this year. The June poll by Chief Executive found that only 28% of business leaders anticipate a near-term recession, a significant decrease from 46% in May and 62% in April. Despite ongoing economic uncertainties, CEOs are hopeful that the Trump administration will negotiate trade deals that mitigate the impact of tariffs. The optimism is tempered by concerns about tariff-driven inflation, with the Department of Labor scheduled to release its latest report on prices. The optimism score for this article is 65.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, aiming to lower energy bills and enhance energy security. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the project would create 10,000 jobs and provide energy independence, asserting that it prevents reliance on volatile global energy markets. However, the project faces opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts, and is not expected to generate power until the mid-2030s. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding, with the project estimated to cost between ¬£20 billion and ¬£40 billion. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
