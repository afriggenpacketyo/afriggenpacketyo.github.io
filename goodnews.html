          <p>As the Dalai Lama approaches his 90th birthday, he has confirmed that the 600-year-old institution will continue, with a framework for his succession to be discussed. This announcement comes amid celebrations in Dharamsala, India, and addresses long-standing speculation about the future of Tibetan Buddhism's spiritual leadership. The decision carries significant political weight, as China insists it has the sole authority to choose his successor, a claim rejected by the Tibetan government-in-exile and its global supporters. The spiritual leader has previously stated that his reincarnation would be found outside of Chinese-controlled territory.</p>

Market leader BYD continued its dominance with nearly 378,000 vehicles sold, highlighting the immense scale of competition that smaller players face in the world's largest auto market.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants in the United States. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits this year, a move that would have cut short a Biden-era extension until 2026. The judge determined that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration.

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to a historic low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded incidents. This continues a significant lull in illegal immigration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive enforcement and deportation policies. These figures are a stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration. The policies include swift deportations, an end to migrant releases, and a large-scale messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation, though they have drawn criticism from civil rights advocates.</p>

The law will phase out the sale and manufacture of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032, a landmark move in a state where the chemicals were developed and manufactured for decades by 3M.</p>
