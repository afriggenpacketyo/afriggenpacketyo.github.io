          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyber attack. Initially affecting click and collect and contactless payments, the attack led to suspended online orders, with disruptions expected until July. While fashion items are now available for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, beauty and homeware products will follow soon, with services to Northern Ireland and click and collect resuming in the coming weeks. M&S estimates the cyber attack will reduce this year's profits by ¬£300m, as some customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen, though payment details and passwords remain secure.</p>

          <p>With millions of Americans facing unpaid medical debt, experts suggest exploring various debt relief options. Credit counseling, debt settlement, and debt management plans (DMPs) can help individuals tackle these burdens. Negotiating with healthcare providers and checking for billing errors are also recommended strategies. Experts caution against using credit cards or loans to pay off medical debt due to high interest rates and potential negative impacts on credit scores. Recent credit reporting changes ensure that unpaid medical bills should not adversely affect credit scores, provided other financial obligations are met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to outline its spending plans for the next four years, covering public services like healthcare, education, and transport. BBC News asked several residents with varying incomes about their priorities for the upcoming Spending Review. Responses ranged from calls for better job opportunities for young people to increased childcare support for working parents. Other suggestions included more apprenticeships, raising the tax-free allowance, and subsidizing fresh produce to make it affordable for everyone. The article highlights diverse perspectives on how the government should allocate resources to address pressing societal needs.</p>

Green will step down after the House votes again on the tax and budget policy bill supported by Donald Trump, citing a private sector opportunity. His departure, earlier than his planned 2026 exit, could impact the Republican's narrow House majority, as his vote will be needed to pass the tax bill after Senate revisions. A special election will be held to fill Green's seat, with the timing dependent on his official departure date.</p>

However, the expansion hinges on securing sufficient depot space in east London, which is also sought by other firms planning services between London and mainland Europe.

Chairman Akio Toyoda informed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Toyota's willingness to sell vehicles manufactured by U.S. automakers through its 4,000 stores in Japan. This proposal aims to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which has been a point of contention for President Donald Trump.

The surge in funding aligns with President Donald Trump's proposed increase in defense spending, focusing on modernizing military capabilities and expanding opportunities beyond traditional defense sectors.

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce executive orders requiring groups to halt diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs or acknowledge transgender people to receive grant funding.

The ruling favors pro-LGBTQ+ nonprofits, who argued that the orders violate the Constitution. The judge's order remains in effect during the legal case, though government lawyers are expected to appeal.

          <p>The UK government is investing in small modular reactors (SMRs), with Rolls Royce selected to develop and build the first ones. These "mini nukes" are hoped to meet growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full-size reactors, and create thousands of skilled jobs. The government also announced significant funding for a new large-scale reactor, Sizewell C. SMRs work on the same principle as large reactors, using nuclear reactions to generate heat that produces electricity, but are smaller and built in factories before being transported. The UK aims to triple nuclear capacity by 2050, but no new nuclear power station has been built since 1995.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts warn that dirty hummingbird feeders can harm or kill the birds they are intended to help. Spoiled sugar water in feeders attracts microbes that can cause infections, including candida, which can swell hummingbirds' tongues and lead to starvation. To prevent this, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture. It is also important to use the correct recipe of one part refined white sugar to four parts water, avoiding other sugars, sweeteners, and red food coloring. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also recommended.</p>
