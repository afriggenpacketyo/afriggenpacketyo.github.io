          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, died at 85. Souter, a Republican appointee, often sided with liberal justices, frustrating conservatives, especially in cases like Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld abortion rights. His retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, to the Supreme Court. Souter's death marks the end of a career defined by judicial independence and a willingness to defy partisan expectations.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced another brief air traffic control outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, early Friday morning. This incident follows recent disruptions and comes shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has expressed concerns about Newark's ability to handle scheduled flights and is limiting flights to and from the airport. Despite the delays, the FAA insists that Newark airspace remains safe.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department and Google are concluding a three-week hearing concerning Google's alleged illegal monopoly in internet search.

Topics will include the Israel-Gaza conflict, with Qatar playing a key role in ceasefire negotiations. The administration is also engaged in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, while Saudi Arabia seeks U.S. support for its own civilian nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The five-story building at 48 Howard Street in SoHo, where conceptual artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude lived and worked for about 50 years, remains almost exactly as it was when they occupied it. The foundation uses the building as its office, but the possibility of opening the home up to the public is being explored. Christo and Jeanne-Claude were known for their massive, site-specific installations that explored themes of ephemerality and public space, financing their own projects to remain independent. The preservation of their legacy feels urgent, especially in today‚Äôs world where art at such a scale feels impossible without a corporate sponsor.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, never left Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts predict the spacecraft could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While the risk of impact to humans is low, the object's size and potential for surviving reentry raise concerns about potential damage.</p>

          <p>Real estate analysts have noted a significant trend of apartment renters renewing their leases instead of moving, with turnover rates dropping from the typical 50% to around 30%. This is attributed to factors like an unaffordable housing market, limited rental supply, economic uncertainty, and the costs associated with moving. As a result, landlords are benefiting from better pricing on renewals and reduced turnover expenses. Analysts recommend REITs like Essex Property Trust and Equity Residential, which have a strong presence on the West Coast.</p>
