          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 10% surge following the launch of its Model Y robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. The service, initially available to a limited number of invited riders, charges a flat fee of $4.20 per ride. CEO Elon Musk congratulated the Tesla AI team on the successful launch, highlighting the culmination of a decade of hard work. While some users reported positive experiences, others observed the robotaxis potentially violating traffic rules, resulting in mixed reactions.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 200,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs due to a potential issue with the electronic door latches that could trap passengers, especially in the back seat.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said letters notifying owners of the safety risk were scheduled to be sent on June 23.

          <p>China's exports of high-tech goods to the European Union experienced a significant increase last month, coinciding with a notable drop in exports of the same goods to the United States. This shift suggests that trade and tech tensions between the US and China may be influencing trade patterns with Europe. The increase in exports to the EU includes batteries, laptops, smartphones, and solar panels, with some countries experiencing unprecedented levels of imports from China. This surge in imports has contributed to a widening trade deficit for the EU with China.</p>

          <p>Senator Markwayne Mullin stated that U.S. intelligence indicates Iran did not move nuclear material from the Fordo facility before the U.S. military strike, despite reports suggesting otherwise. Mullin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, claimed the U.S. believes Iran stored more material at Fordo, thinking it was impenetrable. He warned that if the U.S. finds that Fordo's nuclear production capabilities were not completely destroyed, they will work with allies to finish the job. Mullin emphasized the U.S. has severely damaged Iran's ability to have a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century oil painting at Florence's Uffizi Gallery was allegedly damaged after a museum visitor tripped while attempting to take a selfie. The painting, a portrait of Ferdinando de' Medici by Anton Domenico Gabbiani, sustained damage that the museum believes can be repaired quickly. The museum director warned that restrictions on visitor behavior may be imposed in the future due to the increasing problem of visitors focusing on taking selfies and creating memes.

The memo recommended using alternative messaging apps, including Microsoft Teams, Amazon Wickr, Signal, Apple iMessage, and Facetime.

          <p>Apple's recent underperformance has raised questions about the tech sector's role as a safe haven during market volatility, as it has often been considered in recent years. While the broader tech sector has bounced back strongly from the early 2025 selloff, Apple has traded below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Investors are primarily buying the broad stock market on dips, which inherently includes a significant allocation to tech. Despite volatility, analysts suggest that geopolitical events still present buying opportunities in the tech sector due to the potential of the AI revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

The game emphasizes the tactile truths of human existence, such as the need for physical interaction and the balance between digital and physical life.

          <p>A survey indicates that a majority of couples overspend on their weddings, often due to the pressure to create a picture-perfect event. Wedding experts suggest focusing on a few key priorities to guide spending decisions and relying on vendors' expertise to find cost-effective solutions. Consider trimming the guest list, having the wedding on an off-season day, and communicating budget constraints openly with vendors. Asking for cash gifts is also recommended, but it's important not to rely on it as a primary source of funding.</p>
