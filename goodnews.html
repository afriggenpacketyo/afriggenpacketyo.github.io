          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical with their young son. The primary motivation was to allow their son to bond with his paternal grandparents, who live in Taiwan. During the career break, Jason focused on his mental and physical health, re-evaluating his career goals and realizing his family could be happier with a less demanding lifestyle. The couple's sabbatical also led to an unexpected joy, as they welcomed their second child, a daughter, before their planned return to the United States.</p>

          <p>Companies are adopting autonomous AI agents to combat the rising threat of sophisticated cyberattacks, which are themselves often powered by generative AI. These defensive AI "teammates" are used to automate routine security tasks, such as analyzing alerts and combing through logs, freeing up human professionals to focus on more critical work. Cybersecurity experts note that as attackers use AI to create more convincing phishing campaigns and malware, defenders must leverage the same technology to keep pace. While AI is seen as an augmentation rather than a replacement for human workers, it is becoming an essential tool for managing the overwhelming volume of cyber threats.</p>

          <h2>Review: Xenobe Purvis's Debut Novel 'The Hounding' Explores Witchcraft and Misogyny</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is set in 18th-century England and centers on five mysterious sisters accused of witchcraft after they are rumored to transform into dogs. The story directly confronts the historical trope of femininity being perceived as a threat, exploring why women's bodies and behaviors are often feared. The narrative is told from the perspective of outsiders, creating a refracted view of the sisters and questioning why their strangeness incites such animosity. While the review notes the novel sometimes states its themes too directly, it praises its lush, violent prose and its fresh take on the persecution of women.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against Pittsburgh, a kick that would have shattered the current NFL record of 66 yards. However, because the feat occurred during a preseason game, it will not be officially recorded in the NFL's record books. Despite this, the kick caused a massive celebration among his teammates and showcased his powerful leg, with the ball clearing the crossbar with room to spare. The current official record is held by Baltimore's Justin Tucker, who made his 66-yarder in 2021.</p>

          <p>Albania is emerging as a top, yet often overlooked, destination for Americans seeking to relocate to Europe, according to an expert who helps women move abroad. The country's primary draws are its significant affordability, with comfortable apartments available for under $500 a month, and its lenient visa policy, which allows Americans to stay for up to a year without a visa. In addition to its low cost of living and stunning natural landscapes, Albania offers a welcoming culture and a growing expatriate community. For many, it serves as an accessible "test drive" for life in Europe before committing to more complex visa processes elsewhere.</p>

          <p>In 2025, nineteen U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays, providing shoppers with a temporary break on state and sometimes local taxes for certain purchases. These holidays, often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, are politically popular but tax experts are divided on their effectiveness. Some analysts argue that they primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their purchases, while others note they provide real savings for families on tight budgets. With many families feeling squeezed by higher costs, these tax-free periods are seen as a key opportunity to save money, especially when combined with other store promotions and discounts.</p>

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship. The ship's hull was exposed by a storm, and the local community rallied to preserve the 12-ton oak timbers. Researchers identified the vessel as the former HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749 that was active during the American Revolution. It was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship named the Earl of Chatham before sinking in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox delves into why humans are so attuned to negative news, exploring the concept of "negativity bias." This psychological trait, an evolutionary adaptation for survival, now contributes to a media landscape and personal outlook dominated by doomscrolling and a focus on problems. The author argues that despite constant negative headlines, genuine progress is happening in areas like global public health and U.S. crime rates, but these stories are often overlooked. Embracing a "realistic optimism" by acknowledging these positive developments is presented as a necessary tool for building resilience and inspiring action to solve the world's problems.</p>

          <p>A fragment of a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be older than our planet. Researchers at the University of Georgia determined the rock is a chondrite meteorite, formed approximately 4.56 billion years ago, about 20 million years before Earth. The fireball was witnessed by hundreds across the state in June before the fragments struck the house. The object, now named the McDonough meteorite, is the 27th recovered in Georgia, and scientists hope its analysis will contribute to understanding the threat of future asteroid impacts.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new legislative package to eliminate federal income tax on tips is being met with a mix of hope and confusion by service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 for tip income, but some workers feel it sounds "too good to be true," noting that key details about which occupations and gratuities qualify remain unclear. Experts clarify that the break is a deduction, not a complete exemption, meaning workers will still owe payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, as well as state income taxes.

The column suggests a pragmatic, "reducetarian" approach, which focuses on minimizing animal suffering rather than complete elimination, which may not be feasible for everyone. Recommendations include choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, eating larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, and opting for wild-caught fish. This framework allows individuals to balance their personal well-being with their moral commitment to animal welfare without adhering to an absolutist stance.</p>

The story culminates in a populist rebellion against this new elite. The recommendation highlights the book's enduring relevance in today's society.
