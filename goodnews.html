          <p>Federal authorities have charged seven Chinese nationals residing in Massachusetts in a multimillion-dollar marijuana trafficking operation that spanned the U.S. Northeast. The organization allegedly operated a network of illegal grow houses, using the profits to purchase luxury goods and homes. According to the Department of Justice, the scheme also involved smuggling other Chinese nationals into the country to work in the grow houses to pay off their smuggling-related debts. The arrests are part of "Operation Take Back America," a nationwide initiative targeting transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Farmers in China are increasingly turning to livestreaming and e-commerce to sell their produce directly to the country's one billion internet users, bypassing traditional and often challenging offline markets. These "new farmers" are attending bootcamps to learn how to effectively market their crops on popular apps like Douyin, China's version of TikTok. This trend is part of a broader "rural revitalization" initiative supported by the government, which aims to modernize the agricultural sector. The shift reflects a changing economic landscape where technology offers new avenues for prosperity in rural areas.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty delivered an energetic and impressive two-hour performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The setlist was heavily focused on classic songs from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival, whose full rights he recently regained after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's powerful, raspy vocals and lead guitar skills remained remarkably strong, captivating the large audience. The concert also featured his two sons in his backing band, with one engaging in a notable guitar duel with his father, showcasing a memorable display of enduring rock-and-roll talent.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their trade flows, a move that comes as former U.S. President Trump threatens to impose a 10% tariff on all member nations of the BRICS economic bloc. Trump has been critical of the group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and others, claiming it was established to undermine the U.S. and its currency. The strengthening of trade ties between Brazil and India represents a strategic response from two major emerging economies, signaling their intent to bolster cooperation and resist potential protectionist measures from the United States.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for providing global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The piece contrasts the recent dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under the "America first" policy with China's proactive initiatives, like the new International Organisation for Mediation based in Hong Kong. As the global center for development shifts eastward, the article suggests Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status within China allows it to harness this momentum. This presents a new path for the city to gain prominence on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's "Reconnaissance General Bureau" spy agency, for his involvement in a scheme that generates revenue for the regime's weapons programs. Song is accused of recruiting North Korean IT workers who use stolen identities of U.S. citizens to fraudulently obtain remote work at companies worldwide. This sprawling operation funnels millions of dollars back to North Korea to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile development. The sanctions also target four other entities connected to a similar Russia-based IT worker network, underscoring efforts to disrupt Pyongyang's illicit financing channels.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins that promoted a weight-loss service called Yazen. The post advertised a program combining an app with prescription medication, which is illegal to promote directly to the public in the UK. The ASA ruled that although a specific drug was not named, the advert's references breached its code. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the regulator, which banned nine similar adverts from various companies for illegally promoting prescription-only weight-loss medications.</p>
