          <p>Leaked audio from a 2023 interview between then-President Joe Biden and Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, revealing instances of memory lapses and cognitive difficulties. The audio, obtained by Axios, captures Biden struggling to recall key dates, including the year of his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected president. This leak has amplified criticisms regarding Biden's mental acuity, prompting reactions from conservative commentators and political figures who are calling for further scrutiny and accountability. The emergence of this audio adds fuel to ongoing debates about Biden's fitness for office and the handling of classified documents.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and disrupting travel and outdoor activities. The National Weather Service issued only its second-ever dust storm warning for the city, as winds of 60 to 70 mph carried dust from dry farmlands into the area. The storm forced drivers to pull over on interstates, halted flights at Midway International Airport, and interrupted a high school graduation ceremony. The skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes, but the event was described as "something out of the history books."</p>

Lindner argued that voters desired less state intervention and more freedom, while the new government is delivering the opposite. He warned that the government's fiscal policy, including debt reform to create a fund for infrastructure and defense, could backfire economically and politically.

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former FBI Director James Comey about a social media post that some Trump administration officials claimed amounted to a call for the assassination of President Trump. The post, a picture of seashells forming the numbers "86 47," was interpreted by some as a coded threat, with "86" being slang for removing something and "47" representing Trump as the 47th president. Comey deleted the post after criticism, stating he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence.

          <p>Hong Kong is preparing for a potential influx of mainland Chinese companies that may face delisting from US stock exchanges. Amid rising US-China tensions and regulatory pressures, there is growing concern that Chinese firms trading in the US could be forced to seek alternative listing venues. Deloitte China CEO Patrick Tsang has submitted proposals to the Hong Kong government outlining strategies to bolster the city's financial preparedness, including simplifying listing procedures and securing funding for these companies.

          <p>Chinese defense scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed the Tianxing-1, a small rocket featuring wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. The Tianxing-1 operates on principles similar to hypersonic glide missiles but travels at a slower pace, making it potentially less effective against high-speed aircraft or drones.
