          <h2>Japanese Farm Minister Resigns After Controversial Rice Remark</h2>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for a comment about receiving so much rice from supporters that he didn't need to buy any, which was perceived as insensitive given rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in response to mounting opposition pressure. The resignation comes at a sensitive time for Ishiba, as he prepares for an upcoming House of Councillors election. Eto apologized for his "extremely inappropriate comment," acknowledging the public's struggle with surging rice prices and the impact of rampant inflation on household finances. This article is about the political ramifications of a gaffe and its effect on the Japanese government's stability.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has reportedly reached a tentative agreement with blue state Republicans to increase the cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT) to $40,000 for households making less than $500,000 per year. This proposal aims to address concerns from Republicans in high-cost-of-living areas, who argue that failing to raise the SALT cap could cost the GOP the House majority. However, it remains unclear whether GOP hardliners who oppose raising the SALT cap will support the measure. This article details the political maneuvering surrounding a key tax issue in the budget debate.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease will be available in the US starting in late June, following regulatory clearance from the FDA. Developed by Fujirebio Holdings, the test detects amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's. The blood test offers a less expensive and less invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially making diagnosis and treatment more accessible. This development is viewed as a critical step in improving the availability of new Alzheimer's treatments.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the media's focus on young men supposedly driving the rise of the far right, arguing that a more significant trend is the leftward shift among young women. While a gender gap exists in support for far-right parties, it's primarily due to young women increasingly embracing progressive values. The author criticizes the "male gaze" in media coverage and suggests that center-left parties should prioritize the values of female voters to transform the political debate and encourage greater participation.</p>
