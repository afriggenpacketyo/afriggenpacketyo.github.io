        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Montana Governor Greg Gianforte vetoed House Bill 477, which aimed to phase out Styrofoam containers by 2030, arguing it constitutes government overreach and would disproportionately affect the hospitality industry. Gianforte criticized the bill for singling out restaurants and food establishments while ignoring other industries that use Styrofoam, and raised concerns about the estimated $300,000 cost to taxpayers for a new DEQ program. Proponents of the bill had argued that Styrofoam poses health and environmental risks, but the governor maintained that the state should remain a sanctuary for freedom and free enterprise.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized document will face additional screening at U.S. airports but will not be barred from flights. This clarification comes as the federal deadline to enforce the Real ID law approaches, aiming to enhance security by setting a more consistent standard for state-issued documentation. While travelers are advised to allow extra time for security checks, the government is providing some leeway initially, acknowledging potential confusion and concerns about backups at airports.</p>
