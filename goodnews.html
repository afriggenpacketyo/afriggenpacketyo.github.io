          <p>Country music legend Dolly Parton has announced the postponement of her December Las Vegas concerts until September 2026, citing recent health challenges that necessitate "a few procedures." The 79-year-old artist, who experienced the loss of her husband earlier this year, maintained a positive outlook, humorously referring to it as her "100,000-mile check-up" and noting it wasn't a typical visit to her plastic surgeon. Parton explained that her health issues prevent her from rehearsing adequately for the shows, but she plans to continue working on other projects from Nashville. Her decision reflects a commitment to delivering her best performances for fans, prioritizing her well-being.</p>

          <p>The Phoenix Mercury advanced to the WNBA Finals with an 86-81 comeback victory over the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx in Game 4 of their semifinal series. They overcame a 68-55 deficit in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Lynx 31-13, fueled by DeWanna Bonner's 11 points and three 3-pointers in that period. Alyssa Thomas contributed 23 points and 10 assists, while Satou Sabally added 21 points. The Lynx were significantly hampered by the absence of star center Napheesa Collier, who suffered a left ankle injury in Game 3. This win propels the Mercury to their first WNBA Finals since 2021, with the championship series now extended to a best-of-seven format.</p>

This win brings significant attention to the species, which is threatened by habitat loss and predation, with only an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 individuals remaining. The contest serves to highlight the vulnerability of New Zealand's native bird species, 80% of which face varying levels of threat.

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group experienced a significant 36% rise on its market debut Monday, after its successful spinoff from the parent Sony Group. The newly independent financial arm, which includes Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank, was assigned a reference price valuing the company at around 1 trillion yen (over $6.7 billion). Sony Group explained that the separation enables the financial unit to secure its own growth capital, addressing the increasing investment demands in the parent company's entertainment and semiconductor divisions. This positive debut occurred amidst a mostly rising trend in broader Asian markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has stated that while initial strategic nuclear weapons talks should be conducted bilaterally between Russia and the U.S., the arsenals of Britain and France will ultimately need to be incorporated into negotiations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that these European arsenals are a crucial component of overall global European security and strategic stability, advocating for a more comprehensive approach beyond the expiring New START treaty. This proposal comes after Russia offered to voluntarily maintain New START limits for a year if the U.S. agreed, amidst President Trump's interest in broader denuclearization discussions with Russia and China.</p>

The article provides practical strategies for navigating these challenging relationships, suggesting honest conversations about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries on interaction time or discussion topics, and altering shared activities to minimize their tendency to dominate.

          <p>Establishing a reliable green methanol supply chain is identified as pivotal for Hong Kong to realize its ambitious goals in green marine fuels, according to CM Energy president Wang Yongxin. Although the city has successfully implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling operations, green methanol necessitates developing a complete supply network, including bringing mainland-produced fuel into Hong Kong for tax-free storage and sale. This article features the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, a pioneering large-vehicle carrier that operates on both traditional fuel and methanol, currently utilizing a 25% green methanol mix.

          <p>Europe clinched a 15-13 Ryder Cup victory over the United States at Bethpage, New York, after a sensationally tense final day singles session. Despite entering Sunday with a commanding 11.5-4.5 lead, Europe endured a fierce American comeback, ultimately requiring Tyrrell Hatton to secure the decisive half-point in his match. Ludvig Aberg was Europe's sole singles winner, while Shane Lowry's critical putt ensured they would at least retain the trophy. This triumph solidifies Captain Luke Donald's legacy, as he becomes only the second captain to lead his side to both home and away victories, in a contest characterized by remarkable drama and discord.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its historic windmills, is set to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of overwhelming tourist numbers, which soared to 2.6 million last year for a small resident population of only 100. Marieke Verweij, the village's museum director, highlighted significant privacy infringements, with tourists often entering private gardens and homes. The fee will encompass admission to the museum and windmills, with the generated revenue earmarked for essential maintenance and infrastructure upgrades, although local shop and restaurant owners express concerns about potential reductions in tourist spending.</p>
