        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) remaining in the 4% to 5% range, these accounts offer a stable savings option with predictable returns. An analysis of current rates shows that a $75,000 deposit can generate significant interest, from approximately $794 over three months to over $16,900 for a five-year term. Because CD rates are fixed at the time of deposit, they protect savers from potential future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, unlike variable-rate accounts. This makes them an attractive, FDIC-insured vehicle for those who can lock their funds away for a set period. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has announced an expansion of its employee discount program to include nearly all grocery items, such as milk and meat, as concerns about rising prices from tariffs grow. The 10% discount, previously limited to fresh produce and general merchandise, will now apply to 95% of items for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. The move is seen as a way to support its workforce financially and motivate them to shop at Walmart. This decision also serves as a strategic business maneuver to retain employees and boost sales as the company braces for potential price hikes across the economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while larger tech stocks faltered. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September policy meeting. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs for financing operations and expansion, and can potentially boost consumer spending. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut, a sentiment bolstered by recent economic data and political pressure on the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Wall Street firms like Deutsche Bank and Piper Sandler are upgrading their ratings for Palo Alto Networks, suggesting the recent stock decline was an overreaction. The cybersecurity company's shares fell over 17% after it announced a $25 billion offer to acquire CyberArk, sparking investor concerns about the deal's price tag. However, analysts now view the acquisition as a strategic move that fills a critical gap in identity security, enhancing Palo Alto's ability to offer comprehensive product suites. This reassessment suggests the market is now recognizing the long-term growth potential of the combined entity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has confirmed there are no plans to play league matches overseas, dismissing the idea as "not anywhere near my in-tray." This statement comes as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A seek approval to stage games in the U.S. and Australia. The article also touches on other league issues, including the investigation into former Arsenal player Thomas Partey, who has been charged with multiple counts of sexual assault against three women. The Premier League's stance reaffirms its focus on domestic fans, resisting a trend toward globalizing regular-season fixtures.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Self-Negotiated Credit Card Debt Relief Requires Preparation and Knowledge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are considering debt relief options, including negotiating directly with creditors. While this DIY approach can save on fees charged by professional services, it requires significant preparation, persistence, and an understanding of complex financial and legal concepts. Individuals must be ready for stressful conversations, document their financial hardship, and understand their rights under debt collection laws. A major risk is a lack of knowledge, which could lead to unfavorable agreements or unforeseen tax consequences on forgiven debt, making professional help a safer option for some.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge ruled that the suspension violated a previous injunction that blocked the government from canceling grants at the University of California system. The administration had frozen $584 million in funding, alleging the university allowed antisemitism during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The ruling represents a legal check on the administration's threats to cut federal funds from universities over student demonstrations against U.S. policy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The probability of Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos becoming the next Federal Reserve chair has risen significantly on prediction markets. This surge followed a report that the Trump administration is considering him among 11 candidates to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell. On the Kalshi platform, Zervos's odds jumped to 15%, tying him with former front-runner Kevin Warsh. The speculation highlights the intense interest in who will next lead the central bank, as President Trump has frequently criticized Powell's interest rate policies and is expected to select a more dovish nominee.
