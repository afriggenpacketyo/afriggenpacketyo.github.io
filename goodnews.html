          <h2>U.S. and China Resume Tariff Talks in Switzerland to De-escalate Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have roiled global markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in prolonged negotiations with the hope of scaling back tariffs imposed by both countries, which currently stand at 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on American imports. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are low, the talks represent a step toward defusing tensions and potentially lowering tariffs, which have disrupted trade and increased costs for businesses and consumers. President Trump has suggested a willingness to lower tariffs, but Chinese officials are pushing for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have announced the discovery of the wreckage of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857. The ship was found after a four-year search, and the discovery has been called "significant" because it connects to stories of trade and migration, as the ship had transported over 400 Chinese miners shortly before its sinking. Researchers uncovered several components of the ship, including its windlass, and they believe the ship may have run aground on the seabed and was buried by sand.</p>

Ralston was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The break came when a thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the car matched Sims' print after the FBI upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm in 2018. Investigators also matched Sims' DNA to evidence found on Ralston's fingernails and the murder weapon.</p>

The UK prime minister, who participated in the virtual meeting, highlighted unprecedented unity among Ukraine's allies.

          <p>After nearly 45 years, Oregon State Police have identified a man found dead in 1980 as Larry Eugene Parks, and have named California serial killer Randy Kraft as the sole person of interest in the case. Kraft, known as the "Scorecard Killer," was convicted of killing 16 men in California, but is suspected of killing many more. The identification was made possible through forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which was used to develop a genetic profile from a blood sample.</p>
