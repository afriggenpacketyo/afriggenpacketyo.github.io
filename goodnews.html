          <p>Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni has strongly refuted criticisms suggesting that Super Bowl-winning quarterback Jalen Hurts was merely a 'game manager' carried by a talented team. Sirianni praised Hurts' selflessness and adaptability, stating he will do whatever is necessary for the team to win, whether it involves passing or handing off the ball frequently. He emphasized that football is a team sport and that no quarterback or coach can achieve consistent success without skilled players around them. Hurts has been a two-time Pro Bowler and was named the Super Bowl LIX MVP, solidifying his elite status.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department successfully recovered a lost assault rifle and five magazines after the weapon apparently fell from a squad car. The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken. A resident in the Lennox area found the hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the authorities. Sheriff's officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's honesty and integrity, emphasizing the crucial role residents play in maintaining public safety.</p>

          <h2>New Superalloy Manufacturing Technique Could Advance Chinese Jet Engine Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at China's Dalian University of Technology have developed a new technique for rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in high-performance aircraft engines. This breakthrough could help address a long-standing challenge for China's aerospace industry, which has lagged behind Western counterparts in engine technology. Turbine discs must withstand extreme temperatures and rotational forces, and improving their quality and durability is key to enhancing engine power and efficiency. The advancement is particularly urgent as China is currently developing at least two next-generation fighter jets that require more advanced propulsion systems.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argue that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) should have protected her from prosecution. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was only intended to apply within the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary. Attorneys for Epstein's victims maintain that Maxwell should remain imprisoned for the 'horrific crimes she committed.'</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, often called 'the world’s toughest foot race.' The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and involves significant elevation changes. Becker finished the grueling race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after falling just short of the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. Having started running ultramarathons at age 60, his achievement underscores his belief that age is not a limiting factor in endurance sports.</p>

Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, comprising less than one percent of all meteorites found on our planet.

The family, who did not have flood insurance, sold off a third of their land to afford a new, elevated home. The extreme weather, which saw nearly a year's worth of rain fall in two months, highlights the challenges of what agricultural meteorologists call 'whiplash weather' linked to climate change.

At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of the presentations involved drug candidates from Chinese companies, a stark increase from just one a decade ago. According to the report, multinational corporations are increasingly looking to partner with or acquire assets from Chinese biotech firms to accelerate drug development for global markets.
