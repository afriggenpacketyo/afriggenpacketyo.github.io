          <p>Mel Owens, the new star of "The Golden Bachelor," is addressing public criticism after stating he requested female contestants be between the ages of 45 and 60. The 66-year-old former NFL player explained his preference was based on his personal dating frame of reference, as he had not watched the show and was unaware of its typical age range. Owens said he apologized to the contestants as soon as filming began, calling his comments "unfair" and "insensitive." The article notes that he faced a "brutal" roast from the contestants during a group date, indicating the controversy became a central theme early in the season.</p>

          <p>Following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run for California governor, the race has been thrown wide open with no obvious front-runner. Candidates like former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are now jockeying for position, but political strategists note that none currently possess statewide name recognition. The focus now shifts to fundraising, key endorsements, and the candidates' ability to build their profiles across the state. With the Democratic donor base no longer waiting on Harris, the coming months will be critical in determining who can build the momentum needed to stand out in the crowded field.</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Gad has announced he will perform as King Herod in the final night of "Jesus Christ Superstar" at the Hollywood Bowl after a bout with COVID-19. Gad had initially pulled out of the three-night run, with John Stamos stepping in as his replacement for the first two shows. After testing negative, Gad confirmed his return for the Sunday performance, much to the delight of his fans. The production, also starring Cynthia Erivo and Adam Lambert, has been a major event, drawing a star-studded audience and emotional ovations for its cast, making Gad's return a dramatic final-act development.</p>

          <p>On the European Day of Remembrance for the Genocide of Sinti and Roma, Romanian officials, including new President Nicusor Dan, gathered in Bucharest to honor the victims. The event signals a shift in a country that long remained silent about its role in the Holocaust, during which over 25,000 Roma were deported to Transnistria and killed. Speakers emphasized the need to combat ongoing racism and properly enforce laws against hate speech, connecting the historical tragedy to current political extremism. This commemoration reflects a growing effort within Romania to confront its past and integrate the history of the Roma people into its national narrative.</p>

Originally conceived as a platform for "programmable money," it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are building on Ethereum, valuing its stability and programmability for tokenizing assets and funds.

          <p>England's pursuit of a 374-run target to win the fifth Test and the series against India was dealt a late blow on day three when opener Zak Crawley was dismissed on the penultimate ball. England closed the day at 50-1, needing another 324 runs for a historic victory at The Oval. Earlier, India built a commanding lead of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and surprise half-centuries from Akash Deep and Washington Sundar. Despite the setback, England remains hopeful, as batting conditions have improved significantly, setting up a tense and decisive final two days of the series.</p>

          <p>Cat Eccles, the Member of Parliament for Stourbridge, is under investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner for allegedly failing to declare a trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories in a timely manner. The trip, which took place in May and was sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel, was valued at £2,600. Parliamentary rules require MPs to register such interests within 28 days, but the trip was not registered until early July. A spokesperson for the MP reportedly attributed the delay to an administrative error, stating there was no deliberate attempt to conceal the visit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok as a primary source for news, consuming information through content creators, skits, and memes rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, favoring its convenience and simplified explanations. Creators like Aaron Parnas, who has millions of followers, deliver rapid-fire updates on current events, while established outlets like The Washington Post are experimenting with news-themed skits to engage this audience. This shift raises questions about misinformation, as users often rely on crowdsourced comments for fact-checking on the algorithm-driven platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has limited the Trump administration's ability to deny humanitarian protection to migrants at the southern border, ruling that it cannot unilaterally suspend laws protecting them from being deported to places where they face persecution or torture. The decision partially upholds a lower court ruling that struck down President Trump's proclamation to close the asylum system. While the panel allowed the administration to continue denying access to discretionary asylum, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be granted to those who qualify. The ruling marks a significant legal check on the administration's sweeping border policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling affirms that such practices violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The case stems from sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that targeted locations like car washes and tow yards, sparking protests and fear in the region's large Latino community. This decision serves as a significant check on the methods used by ICE and CBP agents in their enforcement operations away from the border.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, running in 15 tries in a lopsided match at Welford Road. The win, however, was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer for a clumsy clearout in the second half. The incident means Packer may miss some of England's opening matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. Despite the comfortable win, which showcased England's depth and power, the potential suspension of their captain is a significant concern as they finalize preparations for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, have uncovered a major corruption scheme involving the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems at inflated prices. According to the agencies, a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel were caught taking bribes and receiving kickbacks of up to 30% of a contract's value. This announcement came just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following large public protests against a government move to curb their powers. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy commented on the case, reaffirming a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to dismantle the historical barriers that have prevented many Black Americans from learning to swim. This effort confronts a legacy of racial segregation at public pools in the 20th century, which created lasting disparities in swimming ability. Data shows Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers, a public health crisis that advocates are addressing by providing accessible lessons and scholarships. By creating more Black swimmers, these groups also hope to foster a new generation of Black lifeguards and instructors, making aquatic spaces safer and more inclusive for all.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, a first for the state. This growth is not driven by rooftop panels but by large-scale projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined state regulations for development. With natural gas prices rising, solar has become the cheaper option for new power generation. However, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid, which requires significant investment in storage and infrastructure to maintain momentum.
