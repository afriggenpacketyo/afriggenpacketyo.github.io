          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, a significant boost for its foundry business. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, does not name the counterparty, citing the need to protect trade secrets, though analysts speculate it could be Qualcomm or Tesla. This contract is crucial for Samsung as it aims to compete with industry leader TSMC and mass-produce its next-generation 2-nanometer chips, especially after facing recent struggles in capturing AI-related demand.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal on trade, establishing a 15% US tariff on most European goods and averting a larger trade war. The agreement is viewed as a significant political victory for President Trump, though it is not a complete defeat for the EU, which avoided a threatened 30% rate. In return for the new tariffs, the EU has reportedly agreed to increase investments in the US and purchase billions in American energy and military equipment, rebalancing the trade relationship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department announced the shutdown of four major dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material as part of "Operation Grayskull." The network had over 120,000 members and hosted millions of illicit files. The successful operation has so far led to the conviction of at least 18 key figures who administered or utilized the sites, including one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material. Officials have called it one of the most successful takedowns of its kind.</p>
