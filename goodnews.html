          <p>Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning has responded to comments made by his grandfather, Archie Manning, regarding his potential entry into the 2026 NFL Draft. While Archie suggested his grandson would remain in college, Arch clarified that he has not made a decision and is taking his career day by day, noting his grandfather later apologized for the statement. Manning, who is preparing for his first season as a starter, also mentioned heeding his grandfather's advice on avoiding injuries on the field. As the preseason No. 1 team, Texas and its new starting quarterback are generating significant buzz ahead of their opening game against Ohio State.</p>

          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is rapidly expanding its biopharmaceutical sector, with ambitions to become a global innovation hub comparable to Boston. Currently home to 3,800 companies in the field, Suzhou is offering substantial subsidies to attract more top-tier international and domestic firms to establish regional headquarters. The city's government has set a goal to host over 10,000 biopharma companies and generate an output value exceeding one trillion yuan by 2030. This strategic push is supported by academic initiatives, such as a specialized pharmacy academy co-founded by Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, to cultivate future leaders in drug innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has identified a new, small moon orbiting Uranus, the 29th known satellite of the ice giant. The moon, designated S/2025 U1, is approximately six miles in diameter, and its diminutive size is the likely reason it was not previously detected by telescopes or the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its 1986 flyby. The discovery was led by researchers from the Southwest Research Institute, who noted the complex relationship between Uranus's many small inner moons and its faint rings. This finding could indicate the presence of additional undiscovered moons, offering new insights into the planet's evolutionary history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of its victory in the war against Japanese aggression is not an effort to incite hatred but a necessary act of historical remembrance. The author contends that remembering the brutality and sacrifices of the war is about reflecting on truth, not fostering vengeance against modern Japan. Drawing from personal experience growing up with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime, the writer suggests it is possible to condemn Japan's wartime actions while simultaneously embracing its contemporary culture and people. The piece posits that historical education and cultural appreciation are not mutually exclusive concepts in Sino-Japanese relations.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles competition, the highly anticipated partnership of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz was short-lived as they were defeated 4-2, 4-2 by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. Despite the crowd's support for Raducanu and Alcaraz, the duo struggled with their lack of doubles experience. Draper, in particular, played a sharp and aggressive match, often targeting his childhood friend Raducanu at the net. The victory was a positive sign for Draper, who was returning from an injury, while the experienced doubles player Pegula provided a steady presence for their team as they advanced to the next round.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose after the company reaffirmed its full-year sales outlook, projecting total sales growth of 2.8% and comparable sales growth of about 1%. This guidance was maintained even though the home improvement retailer slightly missed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue in its second-quarter report. The company noted that homeowners continue to show a "deferral mindset" for large projects due to economic uncertainty, but it also saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions. Officials stated that their outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global electric vehicle leader BYD has registered a local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, signaling a potential move to establish production in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina not only to import and sell vehicles but also to manufacture them, along with batteries and other components. While the company has not officially announced a factory, this step aligns with its regional expansion strategy in Latin America, which already includes a major production base in Brazil. If realized, a plant in Argentina would mark a significant expansion of BYD's manufacturing footprint in South America's third-largest auto market.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. Lutnick framed the move as converting what would have been a grant under the previous administration into an equity investment for the American people under the Trump administration. The CHIPS and Science Act, passed in 2022, was designed to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, with Intel being a major recipient for its factory projects in Ohio. This new requirement marks a significant shift in how the government is administering the allocated funds. (not investment advice)</p>
