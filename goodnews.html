          <p>Chinese manufacturers are facing overcapacity issues due to weak domestic demand and are offering steep discounts on exports, leading to concerns of a new 'China shock' in global markets. While this situation could squeeze local industries in Asia, it also presents an opportunity for inflation-hit economies to benefit from lower costs for consumers. Economists suggest that cheaper Chinese goods could ease the cost-of-living crisis and relieve inflationary pressure, potentially paving the way for more rate cuts across Asia. This article examines the complex economic implications of China's production overdrive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month and plans to move it to a dry dock for repairs. The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during its launch, causing it to capsize. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs. Analysts were surprised by the speed of the recovery, attributing it to innovative techniques like using aerostatic balloons. The ship's internal spaces and machinery will need to be purged of seawater during the repair process.</p>

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited a challenging global environment and heightened uncertainty as factors influencing the decision.

The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. It also found that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI. The study suggests that AI enriches automatable jobs, freeing up employees to practice more complex skills and decision making.
