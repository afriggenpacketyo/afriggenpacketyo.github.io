          <p>A 46-year-old man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the extreme water hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into the hidden space. After an extensive search involving aircraft and drones, rescuers located him alive and hoisted him to safety via helicopter. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>Air Canada plans to resume its flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants less than 12 hours after it began. The strike, which had stranded over 100,000 travelers, was halted when the federal jobs minister ordered both parties into binding arbitration, citing risks to the economy. The Canada Industrial Relations Board has extended the existing collective agreement until an arbitrator determines the new contract terms. While the airline is restarting flights, it anticipates that it will take several days for its schedule to fully return to normal after hundreds of cancellations.</p>

          <p>Through a program organized by officials in Mexico's Zacatecas state, several elderly parents were granted temporary visas to visit their children living undocumented in the United States, facilitating emotional reunions after decades of separation. The article highlights the story of José Antonio Rodríguez, who had not seen his parents in nearly 25 years since he left for California to find work. The program provides a rare opportunity for families divided by immigration status to reconnect, though only a small number of visa applications were approved by the U.S. this year. The reunion underscores the profound personal cost of long-term family separation due to immigration barriers.</p>

          <p>Australia has granted political asylum to Ted Hui, a former Hong Kong lawmaker and prominent pro-democracy activist who fled the city in 2020. Hui, who faced criminal charges related to the 2019 protests and had a police bounty placed on him, confirmed that he and his family had been granted protection by the Australian government. In a social media post, he expressed gratitude but also sadness, stating that an exile can never truly return home and urging Australia to do more to help other activists who remain jailed in Hong Kong. The decision provides a safe haven for a high-profile critic of Beijing's crackdown on the city.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand All Blacks rugby team has returned to the number one spot in the world rankings for the first time in four years after a 41-24 victory over Argentina in their Rugby Championship opener. The All Blacks established a strong lead in the first half, but the Pumas mounted a spirited comeback after the break, narrowing the deficit to just seven points at one stage. However, two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho secured the win for New Zealand. The victory, combined with South Africa's loss to Australia, allowed the All Blacks to reclaim the top position in international rugby.</p>

          <p>In a personal reflection, the author describes how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from academic duty to a profound emotional connection as she gained more life experience. Initially dismissive of religious art, she found new resonance in the works of masters like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo after experiencing trauma, contemplating motherhood, and becoming a parent. The essay connects this personal journey to the work of contemporary artist Jenny Saville, whose motherhood paintings are heavily influenced by Renaissance masters. It argues that life's significant events, from grief to joy, can open us up to the deep human complexities depicted in centuries-old art.</p>

          <p>After finishing second for three consecutive seasons, Arsenal is making a significant push for the Premier League title, having spent £190 million on new players like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres. Manager Mikel Arteta believes the revamped squad now has the right balance and depth to end the club's 21-year league title drought. The club has focused on increasing its goal threat from all positions and ensuring there is no drop-off in quality when substitutes are used. With a squad of players largely in their peak years, expectations are high, and the pressure is on Arteta to deliver a major trophy this season.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives captured a notorious killer from the 1990s through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, was known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character at festivals. Detectives, needing his DNA to compare with evidence from two murder scenes, met him for a meal under a pretext. They covertly collected the water glass he used, and forensic analysis confirmed his DNA was a match to the killer, leading to his immediate arrest. After an eight-year legal process, Miller was convicted of the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a focus on his "Russianness." The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, showcases 48 oil paintings and numerous sketches from key periods of the artist's life. This emphasis on Repin's Russian heritage comes as Ukraine, the artist's birthplace, has also claimed his work as part of its national cultural heritage, referring to him as Illia Riepin. The exhibition highlights the use of cultural diplomacy and the contested nature of historical figures amidst current geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
