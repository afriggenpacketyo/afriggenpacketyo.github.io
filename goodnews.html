        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that aligns with economists' expectations following a significant rate cut in June. This decision comes as India faces increased trade pressure from the U.S., with President Trump threatening higher tariffs over India's trade relations with Russia. While acknowledging resilient domestic growth, the RBI noted that the outlook for external demand remains uncertain due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and global financial market volatility. The central bank maintained its GDP growth forecast for the fiscal year but lowered its inflation projection, citing a more benign near-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan forward David Martínez was the star of the match, scoring two goals to secure a 2-1 victory for Los Angeles FC against Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty kick in the 38th minute and, after Tigres equalized, netted the game-winner with a skillful individual play. The result leaves the Mexican club, Tigres, on the verge of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the win, LAFC's own chances of advancing to the next round remain slim due to their overall point tally.</p>

The Fever were playing without their star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury but remained an active presence from the bench. The Sparks' offense was led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who both scored 25 points, as the now-healthy LA team improved to eight wins in their last nine games. The game was briefly interrupted in the second quarter when a sex toy was thrown onto the court, an incident players and officials handled by quickly removing it and continuing play.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have established a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire several of the league's media properties, including the NFL Network and NFL Fantasy. As part of the deal, the NFL would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, valued at an estimated $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. The arrangement would integrate the NFL Network into ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service and merge the fantasy football platforms. While the NFL would retain ownership and production of the RedZone channel, ESPN would manage its distribution to cable and satellite operators, signaling a major strategic partnership for both media giants.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026, citing a significant decline in the state's inmate population. The closure of the medium-security facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, is expected to save the state $150 million annually. No inmates will be released early; they will be transferred to other facilities, and the department will attempt to reassign the prison's 1,200 employees. The site, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel, will be maintained for potential reuse or sale, with local officials hopeful it could be restored to its historic purpose.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Setting Official Consumption Targets in Next Five-Year Plan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, a debate is emerging among the country's economists and policy thinkers about whether to include specific, measurable targets for consumer spending. Proponents, including an economist from a top state planning commission think tank, argue that setting a goal for the 'household consumption rate' is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand. They point out that China's rate was a low 39.6% of GDP in 2023. However, other experts express skepticism, questioning whether such a metric is operationally feasible to implement as a direct policy objective, highlighting a key point of contention in China's future economic strategy.</p>

          <p>Dodgers' rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who was sidelined early in the season with a shoulder impingement, is showing encouraging signs of a comeback. After a disappointing start to his MLB career, the highly-touted Japanese phenom has been progressing in a throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and a new two-seam fastball added to his arsenal. The team is hopeful that he could return to the active roster by the end of August, potentially providing valuable pitching depth as a starter or reliever for their postseason push. While his contribution this year remains uncertain, his recent progress marks a positive turn for a player once seen as a long-term project.</p>

          <p>Meta announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, has deleted over 6.8 million accounts in the first half of the year as part of a crackdown on global scam operations. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to target individuals with fraudulent investment schemes and other scams. The company is also rolling out new security features, such as alerts when a user is added to a group by an unknown contact, to better protect users. In one instance, WhatsApp collaborated with OpenAI to disrupt a Cambodian group that was using ChatGPT to generate scam scripts for a pyramid scheme.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter revenue of $7.69 billion, exceeding analyst expectations, but its adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents fell just short of estimates. The company's stock slid in after-hours trading following the announcement. While overall sales grew 32% year-over-year, AMD noted that its AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 chip to China. Despite this setback, the company saw strong growth in its Client and Gaming segment and provided a sales forecast for the current quarter that is above market expectations.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program in April 2025. The judge stated that the transfer of funds could cause 'irreparable harm' to flood-prone areas that rely on the program for mitigation projects like stormwater management. The injunction blocks the government from repurposing the funds while the court fully considers the case against the program's termination.</p>

          <p>A massive, state-backed Chinese copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province is reportedly making significant progress and could begin extraction this year, 17 years after the contract was first awarded. The Mes Aynak mine, one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, has been stalled for years due to security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. The project's advancement signals a deepening of economic ties between Beijing and the Taliban-led government. To address historical concerns, officials have stated the mine will use a costlier underground mining process to better protect the valuable Buddhist relics at the site.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, showed an estimated 4.5% drop in violent crime, which includes murder, sexual assault, and robbery. Notably, the murder rate fell by nearly 15%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a record one-year drop of 18.6%. While experts credit various factors, they also note that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels and that many crimes go unreported.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units can be kept at 82 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler. The ordinance, aimed at protecting tenants from the growing danger of extreme heat waves, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to give property owners time to comply. Officials are encouraging landlords to use 'passive' cooling methods like reflective roofing and better windows, rather than just air conditioning. The law will be complaint-driven, with public health inspectors working with landlords to achieve compliance before issuing fines.</p>
