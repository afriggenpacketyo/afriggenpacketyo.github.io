          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:07:18 EDT</div>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining a crucial stake in Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. The decision affirms that such rights at the asset level do not apply to corporate-level mergers, a significant precedent for the industry. Chevron's CEO indicated that the integration of the two companies will likely result in some headcount reductions.</p>

          <p>The price of ether and shares of companies like Coinbase and Robinhood climbed significantly following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the first major cryptocurrency legislation in the United States. While Bitcoin's value remained steady, Ether saw its strongest two-week gain since 2021, suggesting a potential shift in crypto market leadership. The new law, which now heads to the president, establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins and is seen as a symbolic and foundational step for the industry's integration into the U.S. financial system. This development is expected to provide more stability and clarity for the digital asset market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal has completed the signing of 23-year-old England winger Noni Madueke from rival club Chelsea for an initial fee of £48.5 million. Madueke, who has signed a five-year contract, provides Arsenal with a much-needed direct and attacking option, primarily on the right wing. The move is intended to offer competition and backup for star player Bukayo Saka and bolster an attack that struggled with injuries last season. Madueke is Arsenal's fourth signing of the summer as the club continues to strengthen its squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following an investigation into their Glastonbury festival performance. The inquiry was launched over on-stage comments related to a band member's upcoming court case, which police investigated as a potential public order offense. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The band described the investigation as "political policing intimidation," while a separate inquiry into another musical act's performance continues.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment saw a slight increase in July, while expectations for future inflation fell to their lowest levels since February, according to the University of Michigan's consumer survey. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, and the five-year outlook also declined, suggesting that consumers' worst fears about tariff-induced price hikes have subsided. Despite this improvement, expectations remain above pre-2025 levels, indicating that consumers still perceive a risk of future inflation. Economists view the trend as encouraging for the Federal Reserve, as well-anchored inflation expectations are a key factor in monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act into law, marking the first major piece of U.S. legislation to regulate cryptocurrency. The bill, which establishes a framework for the stablecoin market, passed the House with bipartisan support after overcoming initial resistance from some conservative members. This legislative action is part of a broader "Crypto Week" in Congress that also saw the passage of other related bills. The signing ceremony highlights a significant moment for the digital currency industry as it gains formal regulatory oversight in the world's largest financial market.</p>

          <p>British author Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. Her new book argues that the princes were not murdered by their uncle, Richard III, but actually survived. Based on a decade-long research project involving a team of investigative specialists, Langley presents newly discovered documents as "proofs of life" for both boys. While the theory challenges the long-accepted narrative popularized by Tudor historians and Shakespeare, it has been met with skepticism from some academic experts.</p>

          <h2>Exploring How a Reverse Mortgage Can Supplement Social Security Income</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can be a tool to supplement Social Security benefits and improve monthly cash flow. Homeowners aged 62 and older can convert home equity into a steady income stream, a lump sum, or a line of credit without having to make monthly repayments. This can help cover daily expenses, manage unexpected healthcare costs, or even allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security to receive a larger future benefit. While it can provide financial flexibility, it's a significant decision that requires careful consideration of its terms and long-term implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book "Me, But Better," author Olga Khazan describes her decision to tackle her introversion and social anxiety by enrolling in an improv comedy class. As a self-described introvert, she found the experience of "yes, and" and warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" to be both foreign and terrifying. Despite her initial discomfort and skepticism, she recognized the class as a "rehab for perfectionists," where making mistakes was encouraged. The experience served as a commitment device to force her out of her comfort zone as part of a larger project to actively change aspects of her personality.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, accounting for over 86% of major carrier profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong networks, a focus on lucrative international routes, and an emphasis on premium cabin sales and loyalty programs. While the domestic market faces an oversupply of coach seats and falling fares, both airlines have found strength in higher-margin offerings. This strategy has allowed them to better weather challenges like weaker domestic demand and air traffic control issues, positioning them for a stronger year than their competitors.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's recently enacted "big beautiful bill" creates a new tax break for tipped workers, but its implementation details remain unclear. The "no tax on tips" measure is not a full exemption but rather a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028. The IRS is expected to issue guidance in October on which specific occupations qualify for the break. Tax professionals note that questions remain about how the deduction will work with reporting requirements, especially for cash tips and for workers who may not receive standard tax forms like a 1099-K.</p>

The lineup features operas like Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto" and Verdi's "Macbeth," alongside plays that explore historical conflicts from antiquity to World War I. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser aims for the program to act as a mirror to the human experience, using the stage to illuminate scenarios of demise and transformation. The festival will also feature numerous Russian artists who have distanced themselves from the current regime, continuing its tradition of offering a diverse and thought-provoking program.</p>
