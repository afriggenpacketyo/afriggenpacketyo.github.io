          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress against the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California this year, having reached 30% containment. The blaze has consumed over 80,000 acres and threatened numerous structures, though only one has been destroyed. Favorable weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 personnel have bolstered containment efforts. The fire poses a threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species, and officials are working to protect the area before an anticipated heat wave complicates their efforts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers Clayton Kershaw and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been named to the National League All-Star team. This marks Kershaw's 11th selection, chosen by Commissioner Rob Manfred as a "Legend Pick," while Yamamoto earned his spot by leading the team in several key pitching categories. They will join teammates Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Shohei Ohtani, who were previously selected as starters for the game. The announcement comes as the team hopes for the return of injured pitcher Tyler Glasnow, who recently threw a bullpen session.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a law change that will entitle parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy to statutory bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people necessary time off work to grieve without fear of losing their job. The move, which has been campaigned for by MPs and advocacy groups, is being welcomed as a significant step in acknowledging the impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to offer early years teachers in England tax-free payments of £4,500 to attract and retain qualified staff in nurseries located in disadvantaged areas. The initiative is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at narrowing the educational attainment gap among preschool children. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the goal is to give the youngest children a better start. The plan also includes more frequent Ofsted inspections for nurseries to ensure high standards, though critics have raised concerns about financial pressures on the sector.</p>

          <p>The Green River Drift, America's longest-running cattle drive, continues a tradition started 125 years ago in Wyoming. Each spring, a group of 11 ranching families drives thousands of cattle along a 70-mile route to graze in the mountains for the summer. This practice originated from a crisis in the late 1800s when a harsh winter devastated herds, forcing ranchers to move their cattle to grow hay for the winter. Despite modern challenges like predators and development, these ranchers are determined to preserve their way of life, viewing it as a labor of love and a vital connection to their heritage.</p>
