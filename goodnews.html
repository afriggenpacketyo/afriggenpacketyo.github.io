          <p>A divided appeals court ruled in favor of a 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified as Cristian, who sought to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, stating that his removal violated a class-action settlement protecting unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. The judges in the majority criticized the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act and argued that the government would not be irreparably harmed by facilitating Cristian's return, as his asylum application was not adjudicated fairly. The dissenting judge argued that the district court exceeded its authority and that Cristian's asylum application would likely be denied anyway.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. First Lady Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, symbolically signed it as well, emphasizing the need to protect children from weaponized technologies that can affect emotions and be deadly. The law makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites to remove such material within 48 hours. While supporters hail it as a victory for online safety, critics argue it could lead to censorship of legitimate images and government monitoring of private communications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, has dismissed the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility during a visit with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation. Habba stated that the decision was made to move forward, and she invited Baraka to tour the facility, addressing his criticism of the facility housing migrants without proper permits. Baraka, who is running for governor, has been a vocal critic of the ICE facility, arguing that it is dangerous and illegal, but the Department of Homeland Security denies these claims. Habba said the dismissal against the mayor is not the end of this matter.</p>

The incident has raised tensions ahead of the upcoming Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where eyes will be on Dillon and Smith to see if there's any further conflict.

          <p>Associates of President Trump and crypto entrepreneurs are returning to the market for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), despite previous troubles with these investment vehicles. Several new SPAC deals involve executives from Trump Media & Technology Group, advisers to Saudi Arabia, and individuals connected to the Trump administration's commerce secretary. These SPACs are often targeting cryptocurrency or blockchain companies, reflecting Trump's increased activity in the crypto market. The resurgence is driven by the rising stock market, demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains, but experts caution that SPACs remain a speculative gamble.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to ignore their fears in response to Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to past downgrades that were followed by market declines. He argued that the downgrade prompted more fear than the short-term economic environment merited, suggesting that investors should view it as an early warning to invest more, not more aggressively. Cramer recommended gold and bitcoin as potential hedges against excessive government borrowing, but cautioned against selling based on the downgrade. He advised investors to remember that those spreading fear are either uninformed or shrewd short sellers.</p>
