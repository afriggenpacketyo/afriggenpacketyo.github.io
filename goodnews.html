          <h2>Consumer Confidence Surges in May Fueled by Optimism Regarding Trade</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index experienced a significant increase in May, rising to 98.0, a 12.3-point jump from April. This surge in optimism is largely attributed to positive developments in U.S.-China trade relations, particularly President Trump's decision to halt the most severe tariffs on May 12. The rebound in consumer sentiment follows five consecutive months of declines amid intensifying trade tensions. The strongest improvements came from Republicans, and other sentiment indicators also increased, including expectations for the labor market and stock market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed optimism regarding trade negotiations with the European Union, noting that the EU has called for quick meetings to be scheduled, and Trump hopes that the EU will open up trade with the United States of America. This follows Trump's decision to delay imposing a 50% tariff on goods from the bloc until July 9. Markets reacted positively to the news, buoyed by the prospect of a potential breakthrough in trade relations, although Trump has stated that the EU has been "slow walking" in negotiations with the White House over a trade deal.

          <p>This article discusses whether taxpayers should hire a tax relief professional or attempt to resolve tax issues on their own. It suggests that a DIY approach may be suitable for those with lower tax debt and straightforward finances, while professional help is advisable for larger debts, IRS enforcement actions, or complex financial situations. The article cautions against firms promising guaranteed results and emphasizes the importance of acting promptly to prevent further complications. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual circumstances and comfort levels with handling complex paperwork and financial statements.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Japan's Nippon Steel is expected to complete its acquisition of U.S. Steel at $55 per share. President Trump has reportedly approved Nippon's bid, referring to the deal as a "partnership" that will bring $14 billion of investment over the next 14 months, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. Previously, President Biden had blocked the acquisition on national security grounds, but Trump ordered a new review of the proposed deal in April, despite his initial opposition.

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration does not intend to "harm Apple" with tariffs on iPhones made outside the U.S. This follows President Trump's statement that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones manufactured in foreign countries. Apple has historically produced its products in countries like China, India, and Vietnam. Trump has long pressured Apple to manufacture its products in the United States, and some estimates suggest that a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500.</p>
