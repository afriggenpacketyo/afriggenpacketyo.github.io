          <p>Singapore's passport has once again been named the most powerful in the world, allowing visa-free access to 193 countries, according to the latest Henley Passport Index. The ranking, which measures travel freedom, shows Japan and South Korea in second place, with several European nations following closely behind. In a continuing downward trend, the United Kingdom's passport slipped to sixth place, while the United States' passport fell to tenth, on the verge of dropping out of the top ten for the first time in the index's history. The report highlights a significant shift in global mobility, with Asian economies now leading the rankings.</p>

          <h2>US and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement, Lowering Tariffs to 15 Percent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 23:03:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a significant trade deal that establishes a reciprocal tariff rate of 15% on Japanese exports, a reduction that particularly impacts the automotive sector. President Trump announced the agreement, stating it includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. The deal comes as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose coalition recently faced electoral setbacks. Following the announcement, Japanese auto stocks surged, reflecting market relief over the manageable tariff levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Companies Encouraged to Integrate with ASEAN Economies Amid US Transshipment Scrutiny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 22:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese firms are being advised to deepen their integration within Southeast Asian (ASEAN) economies as the United States intensifies its crackdown on transshipments designed to circumvent tariffs. The warning follows a U.S. announcement of a 40% tariff on imports diverted through countries like Vietnam, which is double the rate for goods genuinely made there. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained locally, Chinese businesses can better shield themselves from unpredictable U.S. trade policies. This strategy encourages long-term, autonomous business decisions rather than relying solely on Chinese government export protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automaker Stocks Surge After US Agrees to Lower Auto Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant rally following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement lowers the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%, providing much-needed relief to Japan's cornerstone export industry. The market's strong positive reaction suggests that investors had been overly pessimistic about the outcome of the trade negotiations. This development is seen as a major boost for Japanese car manufacturers, who had seen exports to the U.S. decline sharply under the threat of higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The remains of a wooden ship discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday have been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back to the 18th century. Originally a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling vessel. It ultimately wrecked in a storm off Sanday in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving. The identification was made possible through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a significant community-led effort by the island's residents to recover and study the timbers.</p>
