          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope said to have been invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being capable of detecting distant earthquakes and indicating the direction of their epicenter. Despite its historical significance, the invention has been dismissed by some scholars as a myth and was removed from China's curriculum in 2017. The new research effort, supported by modern science, seeks to restore the reputation of this ancient technological wonder.</p>

Founded on July 26, 1775, the agency played a crucial role in unifying the nation during the Revolutionary War. The celebration comes amid recent discussions about the agency's future, including potential privatization, though the new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated he does not support such a move. The anniversary event will feature family-friendly activities highlighting the Postal Service's long and storied history.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ligament injury that could have ended his season. An MRI confirmed there was no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, providing relief to the team and its fans. Judge received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 days to two weeks, after which he hopes to return initially as a designated hitter. He first felt the pain during a game on Tuesday after making a strong throw from the outfield.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England fans face a tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions that accompany watching high-stakes sports. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, causes elevated heart rates and a "fight or flight" sensation, which is a sign of deep emotional investment. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. They emphasize reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual over the Pacific. This has led to a persistent low-pressure system over California and increased coastal upwelling, a process that brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, experts warn that the region's hottest months, September and October, are still to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing struggling town centers. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new buildings. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas in designated locations, making it easier to open new bars and promote al fresco dining. The government hopes these changes will help reverse the steady decline in the number of pubs across the country.</p>

          <p>France's foreign minister has stated that several Arab countries are prepared to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament for the first time at an upcoming United Nations event. This move is part of a joint French-Saudi initiative designed to encourage more European nations to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The minister indicated this would happen in exchange for European countries confirming their intent to grant recognition, following France's own announcement to do so on September 21. The plan aims to build a post-war roadmap leading to a two-state solution.</p>
