          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Wednesday as investors reacted to new industrial profit data from China. China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, slipping only 1.5% year-on-year after months of steeper declines, which was attributed to Beijing's efforts against price wars. Meanwhile, steep U.S. tariffs of 50% on Indian exports are set to take effect, potentially impacting India's trade. Despite some "irrational exuberance" in mainland Chinese indices, analysts suggest any market correction might be shallow due to improving liquidity and a dovish Fed outlook.

          <p>Washington D.C. is rolling out a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to enhance its image, featuring local residents who thrive in the city. This initiative coincides with the unusual sight of National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, performing cleanup duties in prominent parks. While some Guard members patrol with police, about 110 are assigned to litter removal, highlighting a broader political debate over the city's public perception. Despite an expected drop in international visitors for 2025, the city anticipates a boost from America's 250th anniversary in 2026 with several major renovations and openings planned.</p>

          <p>Third seed Coco Gauff secured a hard-fought victory against Ajla Tomljanović in the US Open first round, winning 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in a nearly three-hour marathon match. Despite a shaky serving performance, including ten double faults and six breaks, Gauff demonstrated impressive resilience to close out the contested match. Her serve, a known area for improvement, remains a work in progress, even with recent team changes. Gauff responded strongly after faltering when serving for the match, breaking back immediately to seal her progression into the next round, where she will face Donna Vekić. This win keeps her potential path to the world No. 1 ranking still open.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a reduced decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of contraction in five months. This improvement follows a period of steeper drops and is attributed to Beijing's policy efforts aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and enhancing corporate margins. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell 1.7%. While state-backed firms saw a larger profit drop, businesses with foreign investments recorded a slight increase. The manufacturing and utilities sectors showed profit improvements, contrasting with a significant plunge in the mining industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Statesville Planning Board has unanimously approved a proposal from Compass Data Centers to develop a 350-acre data center on farmland, following a recommendation for rezoning. This decision, however, has sparked considerable debate among local residents, with some expressing significant concerns about potential increases in traffic, the safety protocols for batteries within the center, and the adequacy of resources to combat fires. Conversely, proponents of the project strongly emphasize the substantial economic benefits it is expected to bring to the local community through job creation and investment. The proposal will now advance to the city council for its final review and consideration.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, achieving critical milestones after a series of previous failures. The 40-story-tall vehicle completed a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean, and its Super Heavy first stage also landed as planned in the Gulf of Mexico. During the flight, Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators and reignited an engine in space. Despite some reentry heating damage to a protective skirt and control flap, the overall success is a major boost for SpaceX and NASA, which plans to use a modified Starship for future lunar missions, although significant technical hurdles for reusability and in-orbit refueling remain.</p>
