          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe that rice prices will decrease following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a lower target than recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey also shows increased support for Ishiba's Cabinet after the removal of the previous farm minister. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada's invitation to King Charles III to deliver the Speech from the Throne is being interpreted as a message to President Trump and the world about Canada's sovereignty. The move is a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney - a Liberal - has invited King Charles the III to open the 45th Canadian parliament. Prime Minister Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state. It also works to tie Canada closer to Europe - a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, who has spoken about the need for Canada to find new allies as it navigates its changing relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old girl in California used her jiu-jitsu training to defend herself against an attacker, reportedly breaking his ankle in the process. The girl, who has been taking jiu-jitsu classes for three years, was walking home from school when a man tried to assault her. She used her training to punch, headlock, and knee the attacker, eventually throwing him to the ground and breaking his ankle. The girl hopes her story inspires others to learn self-defense.</p>

          <h2>The Importance of Scientists Standing Up Against Trump's Repressive Agenda</h2>

          <p>The article argues that scientists should actively resist the Trump administration's attacks on scientific research, immigrants, political speech, and democracy. Drawing parallels with historical examples of scientists resisting authoritarianism, the author encourages scientists to join coalitions and use their skills to fight back. The author emphasizes that scientific inquiry cannot flourish in a society dominated by fear, censorship, and hate, urging scientists to fulfill their duty to dissent. The author notes that it is also important to resist the secretive and seemingly baseless incarceration of immigrants, the usurpation of democratic checks and balances, and the reorganization of society along ever more hateful lines.</p>
