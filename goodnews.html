          <p>China's initiative to control high-risk local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a list of 12 high-debt jurisdictions. The region's exit was confirmed in a local budget review, signaling progress in Beijing's two-year plan to restructure and manage financial liabilities at the provincial level. This development is significant as the region, a major coal and energy producer, had previously halted major infrastructure projects like a subway due to financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Driven by a burgeoning domestic coffee culture and a zero-tariff policy for certain African nations, China is actively securing new coffee supply chains from the continent. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this push, signing agreements in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to procure thousands of tons of beans and invest in local processing facilities. This strategy aims to "lock in supply" to meet surging consumer demand in China while also leveraging global trade uncertainties to build stronger economic ties with African coffee-producing countries.</p>

The result severely damages the qualification hopes for the Mexican club Tigres, which now depends on other results to advance, though LAFC's chances of moving to the next round also remain slim despite the win.</p>

          <p>Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy made a powerful return from the injured list, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs to lead his team to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy, who had been sidelined since early July with a knee injury, provided a much-needed spark to the team's struggling offense. His performance highlighted his importance to the lineup, as the Dodgers recorded their first double-digit scoring game in over a month, suggesting his comeback could be a catalyst for the team's offense.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, securing a 100-91 victory over an Indiana Fever team that was playing without its injured star, Caitlin Clark. The Sparks, who have now won seven of their last eight games, showcased a balanced offensive attack led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who each scored 25 points. This win strengthens the Sparks' position in the playoff race, demonstrating their effectiveness now that their roster is finally fully healthy after more than a year of dealing with injuries.</p>

          <p>With the average age of atomic bomb survivors, or "hibakusha," now over 86, a new generation in Japan is working to ensure their first-person accounts of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings are not lost. The article highlights the work of individuals like a 12-year-old student who guides foreign tourists, sharing his great-grandmother's story to convey the human reality of the 1945 attacks. These efforts by museums, organizations, and young "successors" are seen as crucial for passing on the message of peace and the true horror of nuclear weapons to future generations.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced that the state correctional facility in Norco will close by fall 2026, citing a declining statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The medium-security prison, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release anyone early; instead, inmates and staff will be transferred to other facilities. The closure has sparked local hope that the site, which was originally a luxury resort hotel in the 1920s, could be redeveloped and restored to its former glory.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy advisors regarding whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a goal for the "household consumption rate"—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand from its current low levels. However, other influential thinkers are skeptical, arguing that such a metric is not operationally feasible as a direct policy goal, highlighting differing views on how to best stimulate China's economy.

In response, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features, such as alerts when a user is added to a group chat by an unknown contact, to better protect people from these scams.</p>
