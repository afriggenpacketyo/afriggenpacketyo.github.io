        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has become an inventor, constructing his own seven-meter-long submarine from scratch. The man, identified only as Zhang, said he had been fascinated by machines since childhood and was inspired after seeing a submarine on a state television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (about $700), he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to begin his project. His creation has since been spotted slicing through a local river, drawing stares and admiration from fellow villagers for his ingenuity and determination to build a vessel that could travel underwater.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Lower Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in rice prices after the government released stockpiles, although inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Despite the cooling, economists note that persistent inflationary pressures and the risk of a weaker yen could still pose challenges. The economic outlook is further complicated by potential U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on U.S. defense and security spending. In a BBC interview, Merz stated that Europe understands it must now do more to fund its own defense, a message he believes the Trump administration has made clear. Despite past tensions and U.S. tariff threats, Merz emphasized that he is on good terms with President Trump and that they are coordinating efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The statement comes as Germany, France, and the UK work to strengthen a trilateral alliance focused on security and economic growth.</p>

          <h2>China Showcases New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing</h2>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) demonstrated its reconnaissance and intelligent control capabilities, including autonomous route planning and threat avoidance, during a recent drill in a mountainous region. The design, which resembles the U.S. military's V-BAT drone, allows for high-speed flight combined with the flexibility of vertical deployment, eliminating the need for a runway. The drone was developed by a state-owned subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, which also produces stealth fighters.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common condition where leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart. The announcement aims to address public speculation fueled by images showing Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand, which was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump remains in excellent health and that tests found no evidence of more serious conditions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Push for Cane Sugar in Coca-Cola Is a Symbolic Political Move</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar is being analyzed as a strategic political maneuver. The move, which has not yet been officially confirmed by the company, allows Trump to score points with his base and the "Make America healthy again" movement during a period of internal party turmoil. However, this article argues that the health benefits are negligible, as both sweeteners are metabolically similar. The change is seen as a symbolic gesture that generates positive headlines without addressing the larger public health concerns associated with high sugar consumption in sodas.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the rules on liquid sizes could be the next major policy change for air travelers. This follows her recent announcement that passengers no longer need to remove their shoes during standard security checks. Noem did not provide specific details on what the new liquid rules might be or a timeline for their implementation, but suggested a more streamlined screening process is the ultimate goal.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, female members of Congress from both parties joined together to play against a team of Washington journalists in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game. The event, which sets aside political divisions, is a fundraiser for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million to date. Participants and attendees celebrated the evening as an opportunity to unite for a common, life-affirming cause.</p>

His passion for the era, which began after learning about the World Wars, is driven by a love for its fashion, music, and sense of community. For the past two years, he has worked at a 1940s-themed tea room, delighting customers with his knowledge and period-appropriate attire. Supported by his family, Lincoln has filled his bedroom with memorabilia and plans to one day live in a home decorated entirely with items from the era.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be over 1.5 million years old, the planet's oldest, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Scientists will melt the ancient ice, drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study the trapped materials inside, including dust, volcanic ash, and ancient air bubbles. This research is expected to provide vital new information about Earth's climate history during a previously unknown period. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
