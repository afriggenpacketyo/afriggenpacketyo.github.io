          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amid Electric Vehicle Boom</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge of over 17% during their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting the ongoing electric vehicle boom. The IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), earmarked primarily for constructing a new factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients, including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing challenges such as punitive tariffs imposed by the U.S. and EU on Chinese EVs, CATL's global expansion continues, driven by robust demand for electric vehicles in China and beyond. The company's financial performance showed resilience, with a 15% increase in net profit despite a slight drop in annual revenue, underscoring its pivotal role in the EV industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Texas Legislature is considering a bill that would ban minors from accessing popular social media apps and websites, seeking to address the addictive and harmful nature of these platforms. House Bill 186, championed by Republican state Rep. Jared Patterson, has passed the Texas House and is now under consideration in the Senate. The bill would require parental consent for minors to download applications and would place warning labels about the dangers of social media, with the goal of protecting children from the algorithms designed to harvest data and foster addiction. While not the first state to consider such restrictions, Texas's proposed law would be the strictest in the nation, potentially setting a new precedent for online child safety measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its earlier decision and will now allow construction to resume on the Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, following pressure from New York Governor Kathy Hochul. The $5 billion project, being built by Equinor, was halted last month due to claims of rushed permits, but the administration provided no evidence to support this. Hochul emphasized the project's importance, highlighting that terminating it would kill over 1,000 jobs in New York. With the project back on track, it is expected to deliver enough electricity to power 500,000 homes in New York by 2027.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Middleton High School in Wisconsin is experiencing a resurgence in trade classes, driven by increasing demand for skilled tradespeople and the potential for six-figure salaries in blue-collar jobs. The school's $90 million campus, built in 2022, highlights the trades, with students taking courses in woodworking, welding, and robotics. Interest in trade schools has nearly doubled since 2017, while university enrollment has seen a slight decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, as students recognize the value of hands-on skills and direct entry into the workforce. This trend reflects a broader embrace of technical education, with 27 states increasing spending on such programs.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned three ancient artworks to the Republic of Iraq after determining they were looted, following criminal investigations into looted art, including one into British antiquities dealer Robin Symes. The artifacts include a Sumerian vessel and two Babylonian ceramic sculptures, all dating back thousands of years. The Manhattan district attorney's office seized the artifacts earlier this year, as part of an investigation into Symes's trafficking of antiquities. The return of these artworks underscores the commitment to responsible collecting and the shared stewardship of cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed into law the Take It Down Act, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the dissemination of AI-created "deepfakes." The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish intimate images without consent and requires websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim's request. First Lady Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, emphasized its importance in protecting children from online exploitation. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some free speech advocates and digital rights groups express concerns about its potential for censorship and undermining due process.</p>

          <p>The UK chancellor claims that Britain is now in a better position on trade "than any other country in the world," citing recent trade deals with the US, India, and the EU. Rachel Reeves suggested that the government wants to expand its new agreement with the EU and pursue a trade pact with countries in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Despite previously expressing interest in a long-term relationship with China, Reeves stated that the UK is "not looking to have trade negotiations with China." This comes as the UK and EU struck a deal across several areas, marking the biggest agreement since Brexit.</p>

Mahdawi, draped in a keffiyeh, used the occasion to advocate for justice and peace, expressing mixed emotions about the university's actions.
