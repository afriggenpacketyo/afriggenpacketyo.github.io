          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. Despite being a leader in uranium mining in the past, the U.S. now imports over 95% of its uranium. The Biden administration banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic uranium enrichment. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still rely on other countries for uranium due to limited reserves. (not investment advice)</p>
