          <p>The upcoming election in South Korea is likely to have a significant impact on the country's relationship with China. While both main candidates support the alliance with the United States, the leading candidate favors a more diplomatic approach with North Korea and China to ease current tensions. This shift in diplomatic strategy could lead to improved relations and increased cooperation between South Korea and China. The election results will be crucial in determining the future direction of South Korea's foreign policy and its approach to regional stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expediting trade deal discussions with the European Union, but skepticism from the American right wing towards the EU could pose challenges. Some members of the U.S. right view the EU more as a rival than a partner, which may complicate the negotiation process and affect the terms of any potential agreement. This ideological divide could lead to contentious discussions and potentially hinder the establishment of favorable trade relations between the U.S. and the EU. The dynamics between these differing viewpoints will be crucial in shaping the future of transatlantic trade. </p>

Despite a Hollywood film topping ticket presales, the overall box office income for the first day of the festival was estimated at 122 million yuan, less than the May 1 holiday. This decline reflects broader struggles in stimulating domestic consumption and a decrease in China‚Äôs box office revenue compared to the previous year.

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, a historic sanctuary in Rancho Palos Verdes, is seeking a new location after landslides forced its disassembly. The chapel's leadership has identified a site next to Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall as a potential new home. The new location would include a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, while offering the same ocean views as the original site. The rebuild is expected to cost around $20 million, and the prospective site is not in the city's landslide zone.</p>

          <p>Young people in the UK are navigating the complexities of religion and relationships, facing challenges ranging from disapproval from their communities to ostracization from their families. Interfaith couples, such as Adarsh and Nav, face hateful comments for their relationship. Others, like Junaid, have been rejected by their families for being gay and contravening Islamic beliefs, while Martin was expelled from his religion as a Jehovah's Witness. Despite these difficulties, many maintain their faith and seek to reconcile their religious identities with their personal lives.</p>

          <h2>UK Met Office Predicts Hotter Than Normal Summer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 21:29:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is likely to experience a hotter-than-normal summer, with increased chances of heatwaves, according to the Met Office. The prediction follows an unprecedented spring that was the sunniest, as well as one of the driest and warmest, on record. This outlook raises concerns about potential impacts on public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, as well as the need for preparedness and adaptation measures. The Met Office's three-month outlook indicates that the meteorological summer, running from June 1 to August 31, is twice as likely to be hotter than normal in 2025.</p>
