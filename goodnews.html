          <p>Comedian Sam Nicoresti has made history at the Edinburgh Fringe festival by becoming the first transgender person to win the prestigious award for Best Comedy Show. Nicoresti's winning show, "Baby Doomer," which explores life as a trans woman, was lauded by critics for its high joke count and ebullient style. The awards also marked another milestone as Ayoade Bamgboye won best newcomer for her show "Swings and Roundabouts," making her the first Black woman to receive the honor. The recognition highlights a significant moment for diversity and representation at one of the world's most renowned comedy festivals.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruptive activity, shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet high within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st such event since December, with the eruption currently contained and posing no threat to nearby homes. The spectacle is drawing visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, offering a dramatic display of nature's power. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma buildup in a lower chamber forces molten rock to the surface, creating the impressive lava fountains that have become a recurring feature of this ongoing eruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new medical implant called the Vivistim System is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The FDA-approved device uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. Ohio restaurateur Tommy Fello, who lost all movement in his left side after a stroke, experienced significant progress after receiving the implant, regaining function that traditional therapy could not restore. Neurosurgeons describe the technology as a first-of-its-kind approach that can generate two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function compared to rehabilitation alone, redefining possibilities for stroke recovery.</p>

          <p>The CEO of the Lobito Atlantic Railway (LAR) in Angola has stated that its rail project is a commercial venture and not part of a geopolitical strategy to counter China's influence in the region. The project, which is a component of a planned cross-continental railway connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, has received backing from the United States. However, the CEO emphasized that the company maintains strong business ties with China, serving as a key logistics provider for Chinese-owned mining operations and relying on Chinese manufacturing for its equipment. The statement clarifies that while the railway is part of the broader U.S.-supported corridor, its primary purpose is logistics and business, not political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>As older generations prepare to pass down an estimated $25 trillion in real estate, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize family conflict and tax burdens. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death, rather than as a lifetime gift, to allow heirs to benefit from a "step-up in basis" that reduces capital gains taxes. To protect the asset from lawsuits and disputes, placing the home in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) is advised, with an operating agreement that outlines rules for usage, expenses, and potential buyouts. Setting aside liquid assets or a life insurance policy to cover maintenance costs is also crucial to prevent financial strain on the inheriting generation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful and costly hurricanes, Florida is rethinking how it builds and rebuilds its communities. Following the devastation of Hurricane Ian, some residents are moving inland to master-planned towns like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features and survived the storm with minimal damage. In other areas, particularly lower-income neighborhoods, nonprofits and city programs are helping residents fortify or replace their old homes with elevated, hurricane-resistant structures. These efforts highlight a growing recognition of the need for proactive mitigation, though they face challenges from the high cost of retrofitting and declining federal support for such measures under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has fulfilled a lifelong goal by receiving his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne was a student at the brutal state-run reform school in the 1960s and dropped out as a sophomore to support his family, having lost out on his education. He was able to complete his degree through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne walked across the graduation stage at St. Petersburg High School, hoping his story of perseverance inspires others who have faced significant setbacks.</p>

          <h2>Americans Believe Ideal Retirement Age is 58, Far Earlier Than Financial Reality Allows</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey found that Americans, on average, believe the ideal age for retirement is 58, which is significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors caution that retiring this early presents substantial challenges, including the need for a much larger nest egg to cover a potential 30 to 40-year period without work. Another major hurdle is securing health care coverage for the years before Medicare eligibility at age 65. Many who retire early do so not by choice but due to health or employment issues, and a significant number of retirees end up returning to work for financial reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Dermatologists Highlight Tinted Sunscreen's Unique Ability to Block Visible Light</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While standard sunscreen protects against UV radiation, dermatologists are increasingly recommending tinted sunscreens for their ability to also block visible light. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, which gives tinted products their color. A recent review of studies confirmed that tinted sunscreens outperform non-tinted versions in protecting against visible light damage. Experts are calling for more research and standardized recommendations, as well as a wider range of shades to suit diverse skin tones.</p>
