          <p>Dennis Assanis, the former president of the University of Delaware, has been named the new chancellor of the University of California, Santa Barbara. He succeeds Henry T. Yang, who led the campus for three decades and oversaw its transformation into a more selective and prestigious institution. The UC regents highlighted Assanis's success in expanding research expenditures and innovation during his tenure at Delaware. Assanis will take leadership at a challenging time for the UC system, which is facing budget constraints, a hiring freeze, and a student housing shortage at the Santa Barbara campus.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon change its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the liquid size rules could be the next policy to be updated. This follows her recent announcement immediately ending the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. Any change would be enabled by new CT scanning technology at airports that provides more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game provided a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, as female members of Congress from both parties played together on one team. The game, which pits "Team Congress" against a team of female journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a cancer survivor herself, the event has raised nearly $5 million over the years. Participants emphasized the importance of coming together for a cause that transcends political divisions.</p>

          <p>A cylinder of ice, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, it is the oldest ice ever retrieved from the planet. Scientists will melt the core to study ancient dust, ash, and trapped air bubbles, which contain vital information about Earth's climate history from an unknown period. This research could revolutionize the understanding of climate change by revealing how the planet responded to past periods of high carbon dioxide concentrations.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June, Though Remains Above Central Bank's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high in May. The easing was partly due to a slight moderation in soaring rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite the slowdown, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. The economic data comes amid concerns over potential U.S. tariffs hindering Japan's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers starting next July. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees. As a result, some shoppers may be denied this form of credit. The new rules will also grant consumers the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and provide clearer information on charges and cancellation rights. (not investment advice)</p>

Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade.

          <p>Following the White House's announcement that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, medical experts have provided context on the condition. It is a common circulatory issue, particularly in older adults, where vein valves in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing swelling. Doctors describe the condition as generally benign and manageable with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes. The diagnosis was made after Trump experienced mild leg swelling, and his physician has stated he remains in "excellent health."</p>
