          <p>A 90-year-old amateur golfer in the U.K. celebrated his milestone birthday by scoring his first-ever hole-in-one. John Payne, who has played for three decades, accomplished the feat on a 200-yard par-three hole, despite having deteriorating eyesight. He didn't see the ball go in himself but was told by his playing partners, calling the "miracle" shot a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Payne stays active by playing golf three times a week and visiting the gym, maintaining his health and mobility in his retirement.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-based Japanese nutritionist details her shopping experience at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting significant differences from American stores. She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional Japanese foods, including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal local produce. The store also offered healthier ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and an extensive range of green tea products. The article suggests these items, which are staples in the Japanese diet and linked to health benefits, are less common or more expensive in U.S. Costco locations.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old dog trainer, was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring on his lungs. Initially asymptomatic, his condition rapidly deteriorated, leaving him with less than a year to live and dependent on oxygen. Despite initial hesitation, he underwent a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, a procedure that has been curative. Now recovering, Kennedy has regained 98% of his lung capacity and is training a new therapy dog named "Encore" to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>According to sources, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China in October or November, after a potential September trip was ruled out. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange the visit, which could occur either before or after the APEC summit in South Korea. The potential meeting follows what was described as a "better than expected" discussion between the U.S. and Chinese foreign ministers. This high-level engagement is considered a crucial step toward stabilizing relations and organizing a summit between the two world leaders.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation Boosts Employer-Sponsored Student Loan Repayment Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid changes to federal student loan programs under the Trump administration, more employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits, a trend encouraged by new legislation. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has made the tax-free status of employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) a permanent feature, removing a key barrier for companies. This benefit is becoming an increasingly popular tool for attracting and retaining talent, as millions of Americans grapple with significant student loan debt. While only a small percentage of companies currently offer such programs, the number is growing steadily. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has made a surprising and critically welcomed return with his new album, "Swag," and its lead single "Daisies" is being hailed as a strong contender for the song of the summer. The album marks a departure from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production. "Daisies" has already reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and its success is seen as filling a void in a music landscape that has been dominated by stale or melancholic tracks. The album's downtempo yet detailed sound is being praised for capturing the current cultural mood.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a public health initiative that releases millions of mosquitoes specially engineered to combat the spread of dengue and other viruses. These "Wolbitos," bred by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, are infected with a bacteria called Wolbachia, which prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them. When these mosquitoes mate with the wild population, they pass on the bacteria, effectively neutralizing their ability to transmit the disease. A pilot program in the city of Niterói resulted in a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the Brazilian government to build a massive new factory to produce billions more.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 72-year history, the People's Liberation Army Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students. Ten women, who all achieved top scores on the national university entrance exams, were accepted into the prestigious military institution. The academy, founded in 1953, is responsible for training the personnel who operate China's strategic submarine fleet. This historic move marks a significant development in the roles available to women within the Chinese military, opening the door to highly specialized and demanding fields previously reserved for men.</p>

          <p>With the MLB trade deadline approaching, veteran closer Kenley Jansen of the Los Angeles Angels is a subject of trade speculation, with his former team, the Dodgers, seen as a potential match. Jansen, who is having a strong season, is a pending free agent on a team unlikely to make the playoffs, making him a valuable trade chip for the Angels to acquire pitching depth. While Jansen expressed a desire to help the Angels win, he acknowledged he would accept a trade to a contender and pitch in any high-leverage role, not just as a closer, to pursue another World Series ring.</p>
