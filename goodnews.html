          <p>Tens of thousands of UK energy customers will receive compensation of up to ¬£1,000 each following a scandal involving the forced installation of prepayment meters.  The payouts, totaling over ¬£70 million, are in response to Ofgem's review of supplier practices.  The scandal involved energy firms switching vulnerable customers to prepayment meters without their consent, often through forceful entry into their homes.
