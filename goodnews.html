          <p>Drake demonstrated his enduring popularity and influence by headlining three nights at London's Wireless festival, drawing massive crowds and dispelling recent negative narratives. His performances were notable for a constant stream of high-profile special guests, including Lauryn Hill, Dave, and Central Cee, turning the shows into a celebration of different musical eras and genres. The rapper received an overwhelmingly positive reception from the London audience, which he referred to as a second home. The star-studded sets successfully shifted the focus back to his extensive catalog and showmanship after a difficult few months in the media.</p>

          <p>As the global space economy is projected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035, China's private aerospace sector is experiencing a significant boom, supported by state initiatives and technological advances. This opinion article highlights the rise of innovative companies like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved major milestones in orbital launches. It argues that Hong Kong is well-positioned to become a crucial hub for this burgeoning industry, contributing to China's ambitions in space exploration, satellite deployment, and resource mining. The piece suggests that private investment in the sector is set to increase dramatically in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is strategically prioritizing the development of 'future industries' as a core component of its new economic growth model, which is centered on technological innovation and industrial upgrading. First introduced by President Xi Jinping, this concept refers to emerging sectors with immense potential, even if their foundational technologies are still in early stages. The government has identified key target areas for development, including advanced fields like humanoid robots, 6G network technology, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft. This initiative is crucial to China's efforts to achieve technological self-sufficiency and leadership in the global tech race.</p>

          <p>Several start-up companies are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using a process called precision fermentation, which creates real dairy proteins like casein without involving animals. This technology aims to produce cheese that tastes and melts like the real thing, overcoming a major quality gap seen in many current plant-based alternatives. However, these companies face significant hurdles, including high initial production costs and a recent decline in the vegan food market. The success of this new food technology will depend on achieving price parity and convincing consumers of its taste and health benefits.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued an order temporarily stopping the Trump administration from conducting 'indiscriminate' immigration arrests. The ruling, part of a lawsuit brought by the ACLU, prohibits officials from making arrests based solely on factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being present at certain locations without reasonable suspicion. This decision follows a series of high-profile raids in Southern California that led to widespread protests and accusations of unconstitutional profiling. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's order, claiming it undermines law enforcement efforts to remove violent criminals from communities.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a crucial performance on the mound, pitching three scoreless innings to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The outing was Ohtani's best and longest since returning to pitching after surgery, and it provided the spark the team needed to end a season-long seven-game losing streak. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's dominant start, in which he struck out four and allowed only one hit, set a decisive tone. The win was a much-needed boost for the Dodgers, who were desperate for momentum.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team clinched an impressive 2-0 series victory over Argentina with a dramatic, last-minute try in the second Test.

The victory is a significant achievement for head coach Steve Borthwick's side, which was missing numerous key players on duty with the British and Irish Lions.

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for contributing to China's declining birth rate by replacing human roles in companionship and elderly care, one expert suggests this technological revolution may not be all bad news. The article explores the perspective that as AI advances, it could fundamentally redefine traditional family structures and life stages. For a growing number of young people, AI offers an alternative to the pressures of marriage and childbearing for emotional and practical support. This shift could render traditional concerns about population numbers obsolete, heralding a new societal paradigm.</p>
