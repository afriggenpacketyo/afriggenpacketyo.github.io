          <p>Stocks experienced a modest rise but failed to sustain gains due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and concerns about investment banking activity. A court ruling against Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs initially boosted the market, but the administration's plan to appeal to the Supreme Court tempered enthusiasm. Goldman Sachs reported weaker investment banking activity in the second quarter, while Wells Fargo terminated a 2015 consent order.

          <p>Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, the principal designer of the first permanent artificial heart implanted in a human, has died at the age of 79 due to complications from Parkinson's disease. The Jarvik-7 model was first implanted in 1982 in Barney B. Clark, who survived for 112 days. While early recipients of the Jarvik-7 experienced strokes and other complications, their survival demonstrated the potential for long-term use of artificial hearts. The Jarvik-7 was later used as a temporary implant for patients awaiting heart transplants.</p>
