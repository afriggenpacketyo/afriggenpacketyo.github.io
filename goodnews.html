          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has successfully secured approximately $100 million in a new funding round led by Alibaba Cloud. This investment marks the company's eighth financing round since its inception less than two years ago, bringing its total funding to around $280 million. The startup, which aims to create "robotic butlers" within five years, also released an open-source AI model for robotics, highlighting the industry's push to integrate generative AI with hardware. The company plans to pursue an initial public offering next year while expanding sales to sectors like education and elder care.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study between Chinese and American researchers has found that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a discovery that contradicts previous models of the planet's composition. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, the team determined the solid core has a radius of about 600 kilometers, proportionally similar to Earth's. This finding is significant because planets are not expected to form solid inner cores without sufficient time to cool. The discovery places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as the only known bodies in our solar system with this feature, potentially reviving theories about past plate tectonics on the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a significant 1.5% rise, and the Topix index climbed to a new record high after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his intention to resign. The market's positive reaction is attributed to investor excitement over potential successors, particularly Takaichi Sanae, who is seen as a proponent of deregulation and economic growth. While the political future remains uncertain, investors are optimistic that new leadership could introduce policies favorable to the market. In contrast to the stock market rally, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and government bond yields continued to rise amid fiscal uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The US Open men's final, where Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner, was delayed due to heightened security for former President Donald Trump's attendance. Trump, who watched from a luxury suite, received a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd, and broadcasters were reportedly asked to avoid showcasing off-court disruptions. This was the first time a sitting or former president attended the US Open in over two decades, continuing a trend of Trump making appearances at high-profile sporting events. The delay and crowd response added a political dimension to the championship match.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Lowestoft, Suffolk, experienced the shock of her life when she gave birth in a toilet at a local football club, having had no idea she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson said she felt no fetal movement and attributed her hip pain to a pre-existing condition from her first child. The surprise arrival of her son, Henry, occurred after a match attended by 600 people. An off-duty paramedic assisted until an ambulance arrived. Such "cryptic pregnancies," where the mother is unaware she is expecting, affect approximately one in 2,500 births.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Houston Texans 14-9 in their season opener, sealed by a critical play from linebacker Nate Landman in the final minutes. With the Texans driving for a potential winning score, Landman punched the ball loose from a receiver, and lineman Braden Fiske recovered the fumble. Quarterback Matthew Stafford contributed to the victory by surpassing 60,000 career passing yards, becoming the tenth player in NFL history to reach the milestone. The defensive play was crucial for the Rams, whose offense struggled to find its rhythm for much of the game.</p>

          <p>A BBC article highlights the unconventional but successful marriage of a couple who have lived in different countries for 15 years, with the wife in London and the husband in Australia. This arrangement, known as "living apart together" (LAT), allows them to pursue different life goals while remaining happily married, maintaining their connection through regular communication. While only a small percentage of married couples live separately, the article notes it is a choice made by some high-profile figures as well. Experts suggest that for some, living apart can provide personal space and help maintain a sense of individual identity within the marriage.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring the beloved landmark can be restored and reopened. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few remaining four-across wooden carousels of its kind and retains most of its original features. The purchase is part of a broader restoration plan for the park ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games, with the goal of having the carousel operational for its centennial in 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Bank of America's head of global research, international investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly allocating capital to Asia. This shift is reportedly driven by the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, a weakening U.S. dollar, and expectations of looser U.S. monetary policy. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, investment has slowed this year, with funds now being split more evenly with international markets. BofA projects the global AI market will quadruple to $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a substantial portion deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a spectacular "Blood Moon," which was visible to stargazers across Asia and parts of Europe and Africa. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that makes the lunar surface appear a deep red. The reddish hue is caused by sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and illuminate the moon. While observers in Asia had the best view of the total eclipse, those in the Americas were unable to see the event.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill expressed "a real sense of disappointment" following his team's 3-1 defeat to Germany in a Group A qualifying match. After an early German goal, Northern Ireland fought back to equalize through a volley from Isaac Price. The team held its own for over an hour, but two German goals in quick succession secured the win for the hosts. O'Neill lamented his team's lack of depth and questioned a "soft" free-kick decision that led to Germany's third goal. Despite the loss, Northern Ireland sits second in its group after one win and one defeat.</p>
