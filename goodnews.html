          <p>Magnus Carlsen, the top-ranked chess player, displayed frustration after losing to current world champion Gukesh Dommaraju at the Norway Chess tournament, slamming his fist on the table. The defeat was considered shocking for Carlsen and a "lucky day" for Dommaraju, who is ranked No. 5 in the world. Dommaraju became the youngest world champion last year at 18, surpassing Garry Kasparov's record, and is the second Indian to hold the title after Viswanathan Anand. Chess rankings are determined using the Elo and Glicko systems, which statistically calculate a player's strength of play.</p>
