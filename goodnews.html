          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst has officially announced her decision not to seek reelection in 2026, concluding her two terms in the Senate. As the first woman to represent Iowa and the first female combat veteran in the upper chamber, her departure creates an open seat that Democrats are keen to contest, despite Iowa's recent Republican electoral trends. Ernst emphasized her legislative achievements, including initiatives to prevent violence against women, support for farmers and veterans, and efforts to combat federal waste. Her decision initiates a significant political race in the state, with both parties now strategizing for the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is aggressively expanding its market share among professional contractors, driven by over $22 billion in strategic acquisitions, most notably SRS Distribution. A crucial element of this expansion is the integration of trade credit, a feature of SRS that enables contractors to acquire supplies with deferred payment options. This move transforms Home Depot into a financier and advisor for large-scale projects, a new strategic advantage. The article details how this initiative aims to significantly boost the company's "pro" and "complex pro" sales, targeting high single-digit annual revenue growth in a market segment less reliant on housing turnover than DIY sales.

          <p>Financial experts are drawing attention to a "golden opportunity" for investors to leverage the 0% capital gains bracket, made more accessible by President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" for 2025. This provision allows individuals to engage in "tax-gain harvesting," selling profitable long-term assets without triggering tax liabilities, particularly in lower-income years. Enhanced deductions, including a temporary $6,000 break for older Americans, are expected to enable more investors to fall within this tax-free threshold. The article advises integrating such strategies, like resetting cost basis to reduce future profits, into a comprehensive financial plan, emphasizing that assets owned for over a year qualify for these long-term capital gains rates.

          <p>Independent rural hospitals across the U.S. are increasingly forming "clinically integrated networks" to ensure their survival and enhance patient care, providing an alternative to closures or acquisitions by larger systems. These collaborative groups, exemplified by North Dakota's Rough Rider Network, combine patient populations to negotiate favorable rates for essential services like mobile MRI units and secure value-based care contracts. The article notes that discussions are underway to utilize funding from President Donald Trump's Rural Health Transformation Program to support the growth of these networks. This model empowers rural communities to maintain local control over healthcare, improve preventive care, and address the challenges of staffing and resources, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and economic stability in these areas.</p>

However, the article advises that while he is not legally bound, departing without adequate notice could damage professional relationships, potentially impacting future opportunities like consulting.

          <p>This article outlines the qualifications for a reverse mortgage, a financial instrument that enables homeowners to convert their home equity into cash without the burden of monthly payments, a solution increasingly popular among retirees. While these loans are typically more accessible than conventional mortgages, federal Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) requirements are strict. Applicants must be at least 62 years old, own their home outright or have a minimal mortgage balance, and the property must be their primary residence. Lenders also perform financial assessments to confirm the borrower's ability to manage ongoing property expenses. Mandatory counseling ensures that borrowers fully grasp the financial implications, serving as a safeguard for both parties. (not investment advice)</p>
