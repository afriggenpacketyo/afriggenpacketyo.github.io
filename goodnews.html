          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished actor known for his roles as Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," has passed away peacefully at the age of 96. Before gaining recognition in front of the camera in his 60s, Adler enjoyed a lengthy and impactful career behind the scenes on Broadway, contributing to 53 productions as a stage manager, producer, or director. Coming from a family with deep ties to Jewish and Yiddish theater, he worked on iconic shows like "My Fair Lady" and with stars such as Marlene Dietrich. His successful transition to acting in later life, which he once considered "the twilight of a mediocre career," demonstrated his enduring passion, as he famously stated, "retirement is a road to nowhere."</p>

          <p>Netflix has experienced a remarkable 150% stock increase over the past five years, driven by robust growth in subscribers, revenue, and operating profits, solidifying its dominance in the streaming industry with over 300 million global subscribers. The article anticipates that the company's revenue and earnings will continue to climb, thereby supporting a higher stock price in the next five years. Nevertheless, a primary concern for potential investors is Netflix's elevated price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.7. As the business matures and its growth rate is projected to moderate, the P/E multiple may contract, potentially causing the stock to underperform the broader S&P 500 in the coming years.

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner, 29, has firmly expressed her desire to permanently reside in her native England, having relocated back to London two years ago after her divorce from singer Joe Jonas. Turner articulated feeling profoundly "at home" in the UK, emphasizing a heightened appreciation for the crucial role of friends and family in her overall well-being, which she realized she lacked while living in the United States. She also reflected on how motherhood, with her two daughters Willa and Delphine, has significantly and positively influenced her professional career. The article briefly recounts her recent divorce finalization and the intense public scrutiny she endured during the custody battle, which she characterized as "the worst few days of my life."</p>

Raleigh's record-breaking 49th home run also marked his ninth multi-home run game of the season, establishing a new major league record for switch-hitters, eclipsing Mickey Mantle's 1961 achievement. A first-time All-Star at 28, Raleigh previously won the Home Run Derby in July and is now on track to become the first American League catcher to outright lead the major leagues in home runs, showcasing his exceptional power and skill.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has emerged southeast of Bermuda, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following closely after Hurricane Erin. As of Sunday evening, Fernand was tracking north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean, approximately 295 miles east of Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center anticipate the storm will strengthen somewhat through Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday, and is expected to remain over open waters, posing no direct threat of landfall.

          <p>Manchester United's recently assembled £200m frontline, comprising new signings Rasmus Hojlund, Matheus Cunha, and Bryan Mbeumo, is reportedly facing "teething problems" with goal-scoring at the onset of the Premier League season. Despite a substantial summer investment in attacking talent, the team has managed only one goal from open play in four matches, supplemented by a penalty and two own goals. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledges the necessity for the new players to integrate and adapt to both each other and the team's evolving style of play. However, critics are highlighting the team's low expected goals (xG) and numerous missed opportunities, including a crucial penalty by captain Bruno Fernandes. The article underscores the mounting pressure on United to swiftly find their winning rhythm, as they currently languish at 16th in the league standings.</p>

While the top prize remains elusive, several tickets did secure significant smaller winnings, including three tickets that successfully matched all five white balls. The Powerball jackpot has not been claimed since May 31, contributing to the growing anticipation. With the odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 292.2 million, excitement continues to build for the upcoming drawing.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer provides his market analysis following a significant stock market rally, attributing it to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal for impending interest rate cuts. This decision, Cramer argues, was primarily influenced by concerns over a dramatic deceleration in hiring, which outweighed the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs. He criticizes "negatively biased hedge funds" for misjudging the Fed's calculus. Cramer then outlines his "Monday playbook," offering investment recommendations across various sectors including Big Tech, housing, industrials, and software, while emphasizing the diverse issues facing the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps. The article also touches on the potential for an "AI power crunch" exacerbated by Trump's energy policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joe Root's magnificent unbeaten 64-run innings led Trent Rockets to a tense three-wicket victory over Welsh Fire, thereby confirming their qualification for the knockout stage of The Hundred men's competition.

Root, however, maintained his composure, hitting a crucial six and a four in the final overs, with Sam Hain ultimately striking the winning runs with only one ball to spare. This victory also solidified the top three teams in the standings and eliminated other contenders. Notably, Root survived an early dismissal due to a no-ball, which proved pivotal for his match-winning performance.</p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal famously encountered a credit card decline during a record-setting $70,000 shopping spree at Walmart. This memorable incident took place after his trade from the Miami Heat to the Phoenix Suns, when he needed to furnish an entirely empty apartment. His comprehensive shopping list included numerous TVs, laptops, various appliances, and clothing items. The unusually large transaction immediately triggered a security alert, prompting American Express security to contact O'Neal, initially suspecting fraudulent activity. Despite this humorous anecdote, the article points out O'Neal's subsequent reputation for astute financial acumen and significant charitable contributions, underscoring the importance of financial literacy and robust credit card security protocols, even for high-profile individuals.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is undertaking its 10th test launch of the massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket, incorporating significant upgrades following a series of three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures earlier this year. The ambitious flight plan includes testing unique engine configurations for the booster's controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship upper stage will attempt to deploy simulated satellites and execute an in-space engine restart before its own splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This test is critically important for Elon Musk's long-term goals of Mars colonization and large-scale Starlink deployment, and also for NASA's Artemis program, which is depending on Starship for lunar landings by 2027. However, many aerospace observers consider this NASA timeline unrealistic given the complex in-space refueling requirements.</p>

          <p>Levi Kelly, a renowned tiny homes expert and builder, successfully constructed a remarkably compact 19-square-foot tiny house, which he humorously describes as "the size of a closet," for just $5,000 in his southern Ohio front yard. Driven by a long-standing fascination with creative small spaces, Kelly transformed an old utility trailer into a fully functional dwelling in merely one month, significantly reducing costs by utilizing many existing materials. The primary expenses included lumber, insulation, solar power components, and electrical systems, with a refurbished AC and heating unit being a notable investment to impart a luxurious feel. Despite its minimal footprint, the house is equipped with essential amenities such as a tilting bed, integrated storage, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower system, all efficiently powered by rooftop solar panels.</p>
