          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstructed natural light. Some projects have been scrapped due to this opposition, as locals describe the facilities as imposing and "eerie." Tech companies are investing heavily in these digital hubs to meet the growing demands of cloud computing and AI, but they face challenges in finding suitable sites in Japan. Some municipalities are responding by implementing stricter regulations, while industry groups emphasize the importance of building trust with affected communities.</p>

          <p>Enzo Maresca is confident that Liam Delap can handle the pressure of being Chelsea's main striker and believes he has the potential to become England's next No. 9. Delap, who recently moved from Ipswich Town, is eager to make a strong impression and is competing with Nicolas Jackson for a starting spot. Maresca coached Delap previously at Manchester City's academy, which helped convince him to sign with Chelsea despite interest from other clubs. Chelsea intends to sign another winger after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United, and they are interested in Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays and the government's consumer goods trade-in program. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output growth slowed slightly. Fixed-asset investment expanded, but property investment continued to contract, and the urban unemployment rate eased to its lowest level since November. The rise in retail sales came as a surprise and was likely boosted by the consumer goods trade-in program, but falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos surged after the company received a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group.

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, assuming no superior proposal emerges.

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, as gambling with overseas-based betting sites is illegal in Japan. The government is addressing the issue by urging operators to cut off access to their sites, many of which are available in Japanese. This crackdown follows media revelations that some athletes and celebrities have used online casinos. A law is expected to be enacted soon to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.</p>

          <p>J.J. Spaun triumphed at the U.S. Open, beating Robert MacIntyre by two shots to secure his first major title. Spaun showcased resilience by overcoming a flooded golf course and a rain delay. The 34-year-old American holed an incredible 64-foot birdie putt on the final hole to win by two on one under. MacIntyre, watching on television, applauded and mouthed "wow" at Spaun's success, while others like Sam Burns and Adam Scott struggled in the challenging conditions.</p>

          <p>The final evacuation order has been officially lifted nearly six months after the Palisades fire, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. A portion of the coastal Los Angeles neighborhood had remained under an evacuation order because of dangerous downed wires, potentially explosive lithium-ion batteries and toxic wildfire debris. The Army Corps of Engineers has overseen federal contractors in clearing wreckage away from more than 3,200 properties. Public safety and health authorities are asking people to exercise caution, such as wearing an N-95 mask to prevent exposure to toxic dust.</p>
