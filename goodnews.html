          <p>President Trump adopted a surprisingly cordial tone during a meeting with Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, after months of publicly criticizing Canada and suggesting its annexation into the United States. Trump, who had previously referred to Canada as a "state" and its leader as a "governor," expressed his affection for the country and its people. Despite Trump's attempts to joke about the possibility of Canada becoming the 51st state, Carney firmly rejected the notion, emphasizing that Canada is "not for sale."</p>

          <p>The Met Gala faced criticism after some viewers felt that South Asian celebrities, specifically Shah Rukh Khan and Diljit Dosanjh, were not given the same level of recognition and respect as other attendees.

The incident sparked discussions about cultural representation and the importance of acknowledging the international influence of South Asian stars on global platforms.</p>

          <p>A French technology developed by chemist Yves Ocello is being implemented in China to refine low-grade bauxite into high-quality aluminum. The technology neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing the use of bauxite with high silica content, which is abundant in China but previously unusable. This could reduce China's dependence on imported aluminum ore from Guinea and Australia. The green tech company IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement the technology in a plant in Shanxi province.</p>
