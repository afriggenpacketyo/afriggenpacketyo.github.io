          <p>Sources indicate that President Trump had approved a plan for a potential U.S. attack on an Iranian nuclear facility before a lunch meeting with Steve Bannon. Bannon, however, opposed the idea, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the potential risks to U.S. troops in the Middle East. A White House official maintains that Trump had already decided to hold off on the strike before the meeting with Bannon. The situation underscores the complexities and tensions surrounding U.S. policy in the region.</p>
