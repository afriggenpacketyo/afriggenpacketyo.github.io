          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons was based on salary cap mathematics rather than any personal issues. He explained that trading one player on a massive contract allows the team to afford multiple other top-tier players, increasing overall on-field availability and depth. This context follows Parsons signing a record-breaking contract with the Green Bay Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is evaluating a measure that would mandate landlords to ensure their rental units can be kept at or below a temperature of 82 degrees. This proposal aligns with a similar law recently enacted in unincorporated areas of the county and aims to mitigate the public health risks associated with extreme heat, which disproportionately impacts vulnerable residents. The initiative has met with opposition from landlord associations, who express concerns over implementation costs and the potential for increased rents.</p>

          <p>With home equity levels at record highs and interest rates relatively low, homeowners may be tempted to borrow against their property's value. This article advises caution, urging homeowners to ask critical questions first, such as accurately determining their available equity and assessing the true urgency of their financial needs. It also highlights the importance of considering the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut in September, which could result in more favorable loan terms in the near future.

          <p>The rapid global adoption of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, is creating a strategic dilemma for China because over 99% of them are backed by the US dollar. This dominance of dollar-denominated digital currency far surpasses the greenback's share in traditional global finance and foreign exchange reserves. The article examines the implications of this financial innovation and explores how Beijing might respond to a technology that reinforces the global supremacy of the US dollar.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland achieved a 3-1 victory against Luxembourg in their World Cup qualifying match, thanks to a decisive second-half performance. After Jamie Reid scored an early goal, Luxembourg equalized before halftime, prompting what manager Michael O'Neill called a stern talk during the interval. Shea Charles quickly reclaimed the lead after the break, and Justin Devenny added a third goal shortly after a Luxembourg player was sent off, securing a crucial win for the team.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut widely anticipated for September, savers are being encouraged to act quickly to secure high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs) before rates decline. This article advises that individuals with significant savings, such as $10,000, should consider depositing more if feasible and should shop directly with online banks, which generally offer more competitive rates. It also cautions against delaying action, as banks frequently adjust their CD rates in anticipation of official Fed announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy is no longer the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years in the role, a decision reportedly directed by the club's ownership. As the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, Levy oversaw major infrastructure projects, including a new stadium, but faced persistent criticism from fans over the club's limited on-field success, having won only one major trophy during his tenure. Peter Charrington will take on the new role of non-executive chairman as the club begins a new era.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been steadily decreasing throughout 2025, providing some relief for potential homebuyers and homeowners considering refinancing. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has dropped by over half a percentage point since January, with the potential for further declines if the Federal Reserve implements expected rate cuts. Although rates are not at the historic lows of a few years ago, the consistent downward trend indicates a more favorable borrowing climate is emerging.</p>

          <p>This article provides an analysis of the complex and debated legacy of Daniel Levy, who has stepped down as Tottenham Hotspur's executive chairman after nearly 25 years. He is widely acknowledged for transforming the club's business operations and infrastructure, building a world-class stadium and making the club highly profitable. However, his tenure is simultaneously defined by a stark lack of on-field trophies and a high turnover of managers, which has made him a deeply polarizing and contentious figure among the team's supporters.</p>

The Treasury Department has issued a preliminary list of 68 eligible occupations, which includes traditional tipped jobs like waiters and bartenders, along with some surprising additions like plumbers, electricians, and house painters. To qualify, workers must earn less than $150,000 annually, with the tax-free tip income capped at $25,000 per year through 2028.</p>
