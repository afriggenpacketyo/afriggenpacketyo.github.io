          <p>Chinese tech giant Tencent announced a 13% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, propelled by strong growth in its gaming division, particularly from titles like "Honor of Kings" and "PUBG Mobile." While revenue exceeded expectations at 180.02 billion Chinese yuan, net profit fell slightly short, registering at 47.8 billion yuan. Tencent's WeChat platform, boasting over 1.4 billion monthly active users, has also seen substantial growth in advertising revenue through its video, search, and Mini Program offerings, as the company continues to monetize its extensive user base and expand its digital services. The article highlights Tencent's robust performance in both domestic and international gaming markets, underscoring its position as a leading global gaming company.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, experts suggest that investors should consider allocating 5% to 10% of their portfolio to gold as a safe haven asset, while emphasizing the importance of assessing individual risk appetite and market conditions. It's recommended to buy gold gradually over time to mitigate the risk of purchasing at a high point and to allow for adjustments based on market trends, such as interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events. Financial advisors recommend rebalancing portfolios annually to ensure diversification and maintaining the appropriate gold allocation, cautioning against over-investing due to storage, tax, and liquidity concerns. The article advises monitoring market indicators and adjusting gold purchases based on real interest rates, dollar strength, and geopolitical stress (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a tariff truce with the United States, China is preparing for ongoing rivalry with Washington, focusing on economic and diplomatic opportunities in Asia while maintaining a firm stance on regional territorial claims. According to this New York Times article, Beijing views the tariff reduction as a tactical retreat by the U.S. rather than a fundamental shift in hostile intentions towards the Chinese Communist Party. China's approach includes presenting itself as a stable alternative in the face of upheaval in Washington's trade policy, while simultaneously asserting its power and warning against external interference in its frontier regions. This strategy reflects a belief that economic incentives and territorial ambitions can coexist, as China continues to pursue both cooperation and competition in its foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have entered a new phase of relations marked by "mutual respect" following a trade truce that lowered tariffs, signaling a departure from previous tensions, according to this CNBC article. Businesses are now adapting to mitigate tariff uncertainty, recognizing that the post-World War II trade framework is gone, leading to supply chain diversification and potential production halts for smaller businesses. China is emphasizing self-sufficiency and diversifying its exports to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Latin America, even as the U.S. enforces tariff exemptions on products with significant China-made components. Experts anticipate further tariff cuts and a continuation of the largest trading relationship in the world, though some caution that the U.S. remains on the offensive and China is learning to prepare for future challenges.</p>

He stressed that any future funding method must ensure the BBC remains a universal service, rejecting advertising or subscription models, and reminded BBC presenters to avoid compromising the corporation's impartiality on social media.

          <p>To combat its declining birthrate, Japan is considering eliminating out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, by covering normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system. Currently, childbirth is not covered by insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures, though the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, which often falls short of actual expenses. If implemented, this policy would establish a unified price nationwide, though obstetricians have raised concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

By targeting middle-income countries for funding, NeoTest hopes to demonstrate that major international health projects can be supported by the countries they are designed to help, reducing reliance on traditional foreign aid.

The move, which reverses a long-standing policy, has been met with jubilation in Damascus and is expected to facilitate the delivery of aid, attract investments from wealthy neighbors, and foster regional stability. While challenges remain, including the need for massive investment and resettlement of displaced people, the easing of sanctions is seen as a crucial step towards rebuilding Syria's devastated infrastructure and economy, though the speed and scope of the sanctions' removal remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>China Uses Rare Earth Minerals as Leverage in US Trade Negotiations</h2>

          <p>As part of a trade truce with the US, China is moderately relaxing export controls on some rare earth minerals, which are critical for hi-tech and aerospace hardware, reflecting its goodwill in de-escalating tensions while maintaining control over these strategic resources. This move follows China's earlier curbs on exports of certain rare earth metals, which led to significant price surges in the overseas market. According to analysts, this "kite-flying strategy" aims to provide the US with some breathing room without provoking desperate measures that could help the US break free from China's control over these critical minerals.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Radar Clocks Speeding Duck as Likely Repeat Offender</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 07:56:24 EDT</div>

          <p>Police in Koniz, Switzerland, discovered that a radar image of a speed offender was a duck going 52 kilometers per hour in a 30-km zone, with authorities suggesting it was a "repeat offender" after a similar incident in 2018. Despite considering it a belated April Fool's joke, officials confirmed that the radar system and images are calibrated and sealed, making manipulation impossible. The municipality hopes the incident provides amusement regarding curious coincidences, animal criminal activities, and the maximum flight speed of ducks.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz is investing $3 billion to upgrade its U.S. factories, its largest investment in its plants in a decade, even as executives say consumer sentiment is at its second-lowest point in 70 years. The upgrades aim to lower costs through increased efficiency and help offset the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which factored into the company's decision. This investment will also enable Kraft Heinz to develop and sell new products more quickly, allowing the packaged food maker to defend its market share amid economic uncertainty.</p>
