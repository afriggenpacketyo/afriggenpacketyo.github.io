          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams has publicly disclosed her use of weight loss drugs, aiming to destigmatize such medications and share her post-pregnancy struggles. Despite intense training, Williams found herself unable to lose 31 pounds, leading her to try GLP-1 drugs, similar to many friends. While her transparency is seen as a breakthrough by some, challenging stereotypes about "lazy" individuals, critics question the timing given her new spokesperson role for a company selling these drugs. The article explores the broader impact of celebrities like Williams and Oprah Winfrey speaking out, acknowledging both the potential for reducing shame and concerns about belittling hard work or overlooking side effects.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to unveil its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a digital display, codenamed Hypernova, alongside a new gesture-control wristband at its Connect conference next month. The Hypernova glasses, expected to cost around $800 and developed with EssilorLuxottica, will feature a small color display in the right lens for basic information like text messages. The accompanying wristband, utilizing CTRL Labs technology, aims to allow users to control devices with hand gestures, serving as a key input for future full AR glasses. While Meta is setting low sales expectations due to the device's weight and limited visual features, this launch signifies a deeper push into augmented reality wearables.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated hit "KPop Demon Hunters" is projected to be the top-grossing film this weekend, despite a limited theatrical release for sing-along screenings. Industry sources estimate the movie could earn $16 million to $22 million, potentially surpassing other films. However, Netflix's long-standing policy of not releasing box office figures means its success will remain officially unconfirmed, frustrating theater owners. The article highlights the complex relationship between streamers and exhibitors, as Netflix views theatrical runs primarily as marketing for its subscriber base. The film, a viral phenomenon, features a girl group battling evil with music and dance, resonating with audiences for its catchy songs and strong female characters.</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, surged nearly 14% to trade close to its 2021 all-time high of $4,866.01, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments at Jackson Hole. Powell's remarks, hinting at upcoming interest rate cuts, prompted a "panicked repositioning" among traders, leading to significant short liquidations in Ether and a 4% rise in Bitcoin. The article highlights that this market momentum has returned as the administration and the Fed appear aligned on easing policies. This robust market reaction underscores the profound sensitivity of risk assets like cryptocurrencies to shifts in macroeconomic policy and broader investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares rose over 3% following a Bloomberg report indicating that Apple is in early discussions to potentially integrate Google's Gemini AI models into an updated version of its Siri assistant. The article suggests Apple is exploring the possibility of Google developing a custom AI model for a new Siri, which could launch as early as next year. This development is significant given Google's Gemini models consistently rank high in AI advancements, contrasting with Apple's struggles in defining its own artificial intelligence strategy. The reported talks also carry broader implications for Google's lucrative search deals with Apple, particularly with a U.S. judge expected to rule on Google's alleged search monopoly this month.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% non-voting equity stake in Intel, the only American company capable of producing advanced chips on U.S. soil. This unprecedented move, confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, involves converting grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into government ownership, signaling a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy. The article highlights Intel's recent financial challenges, including revenue declines and delays in its Ohio factory construction, as well as its struggle to compete with market leaders like Nvidia. While intended to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, the long-term implications of this direct government involvement for Intel's operational independence and market dynamics are yet to be fully understood.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will drop some of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, though levies on autos, steel, and aluminum will remain. This decision follows a phone call between Carney and President Trump, marking a step towards de-escalating trade tensions. The tariffs, initially a 25% levy on C$30bn worth of U.S. products, were imposed in response to U.S. tariffs. Canada will now align with the U.S. by ending tariffs on goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, effective September 1. The article notes Trump's positive reaction but also Canadian political criticism of Carney's "capitulation."</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated potential interest rate cuts in his Jackson Hole speech, acknowledging "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies creating significant economic uncertainty. While noting a resilient labor market, Powell highlighted rising downside risks and the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, a stagflation scenario the Fed aims to avoid. With policy already restrictive, he stated that the "shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance," hinting at a September rate cut. The article also touches on the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and the importance of its independence amid political pressures for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, the IRS has clarified a crucial flexibility: buyers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract to purchase a vehicle before the deadline, even if delivery occurs later. A payment, including a nominal downpayment or trade-in, is required by September 30. This guidance provides wiggle room for those ordering vehicles or awaiting shipment, and is consistent with previous IRS interpretations and legislative intent. The article notes an expected near-term bump in EV sales ahead of the expiration, followed by a potential drop, as the Trump administration rolls back EV promotion policies.
