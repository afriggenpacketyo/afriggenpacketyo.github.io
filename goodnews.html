          <h2>Businesses Employ 'Tariff Engineering' to Avoid Higher Import Duties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 23:15:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," a legal practice involving altering product materials or dimensions to fit into lower-tariffed categories. This strategy allows companies to reduce their duty liabilities by strategically redesigning products. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum elements or footwear companies adding fuzzy-felt fabric to classify sneakers as slippers. While effective for some sectors like garments and footwear, more sophisticated industries face challenges due to extensive validation requirements, but companies must tread carefully to avoid misrepresenting product classifications. This is a complex game of cat and mouse, where companies try to outsmart customs officials to save money.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Zillow report, choosing the right interior paint colors can boost a home's sale price by nearly $2,600. Olive green is the most desirable kitchen color, potentially increasing the sale price by $1,600, while classic navy blue walls are preferred in bedrooms, adding an estimated $1,815 in value. Dark gray living rooms are also favored over lighter colors, contributing an additional $2,600 to the offer. Bright and playful colors, such as lemon yellow or scarlet red, can negatively impact a home's sale price. The use of specific colors can greatly affect the appeal and value of a home for potential buyers.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that U.S. Steel is of increasing strategic importance, as higher U.S. tariffs on steel products are expected to remain in place. Hashimoto believes the acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, but trade levies will not revive its manufacturing sector. The company finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after President Trump reversed his initial opposition. Nippon Steel has pledged to invest around $11 billion by 2028 in U.S. Steel and maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The deal includes a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, granting veto power over key management decisions.</p>

Four of the chicks are being raised under a double-brooding method, a technique pioneered by the zoo. All chicks bred at the zoo are eligible to be released into the wild as part of the California Condor Recovery Program. The species remains critically endangered, but the program has seen significant success, increasing the population from just 22 condors four decades ago to 561 as of 2024.</p>

          <h2>Lid Removed From Bear's Neck After Two Years</h2>

          <p>Wildlife experts in Michigan successfully trapped a black bear and removed a large plastic lid that had been stuck around its neck for two years. The bear was first spotted as a cub in 2023 with the lid, and the Department of Natural Resources had been searching for it since. The bear was anesthetized, and the lid was cut off, revealing a scarred neck but the bear was otherwise in good condition. It remains unclear how the lid became stuck on the bear's neck or how it survived through multiple winters with the obstruction.</p>

          <h2>FDA Approves Lenacapavir as Twice-Yearly HIV Prevention Injection</h2>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials showed a 99.9% success rate in preventing HIV among participants who received the drug. This approval is considered a significant milestone in the fight against HIV, offering a new tool for prevention. However, the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research has drawn criticism, with experts emphasizing the continued need for a vaccine despite advancements in prevention methods.</p>
