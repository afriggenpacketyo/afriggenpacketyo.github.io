          <p>Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has launched a new electric SUV, the YU7, with a starting price lower than Tesla's Model Y in China. The company reported receiving over 200,000 orders within three minutes of the launch, causing its stock to surge. While the YU7 boasts a longer driving range and various AI features, it reportedly falls short of Tesla's driver-assist capabilities. This launch intensifies the ongoing EV price war in the competitive Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Microsoft announced it is retiring the infamous "Blue Screen of Death," a system error message that has been a part of the Windows operating system for over four decades. The change, part of a broader effort to improve system resilience following a major IT outage, will replace the blue background with a black one. The new, simplified error screen will feature more condensed text and will be rolled out to Windows 11 devices later this summer, aiming to make unexpected restarts less jarring for users.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire on July 9. A spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical" and could be moved if key trading partners continue to negotiate in good faith. The remarks came as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks. Japan is particularly concerned about additional U.S. tariffs on its automotive industry, which currently faces a total rate of 27.5 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, led by GreenRoots, aims to combat extreme temperatures in the densely developed, low-shade neighborhood. Interventions include planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. This urban laboratory provides a potential template for other cities to address rising heat waves exacerbated by climate change, which disproportionately affect urban areas.</p>
