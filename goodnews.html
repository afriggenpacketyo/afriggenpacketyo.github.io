          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump at the White House, aiming to firmly establish that Canada will not become part of the United States. Carney emphasized Canada's independence, stating it is "not for sale," while Trump responded with "never say never." The meeting occurred amidst historically strained relations due to Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods and his repeated suggestions of a U.S.-Canada merger. Despite Trump's earlier criticisms of Canada on social media, the tone during the meeting was largely conciliatory, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory. Discussions are expected to continue, focusing on trade, security, and defense.</p>

          <p>The notorious AI-generated pornography site, MrDeepFakes, has ceased operations after a critical service provider terminated its services, resulting in data loss.
