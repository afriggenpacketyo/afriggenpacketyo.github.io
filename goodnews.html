          <p>According to House Speaker Mike Johnson, New York Representative Andrew Garbarino missed a crucial vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill because he fell asleep. The bill passed by a single vote, and Garbarino, who supports the legislation, was reportedly moments away from the House floor when the vote closed. Garbarino stated that he fought to lift the cap on SALT and ensure hardworking Long Island families see the benefits of this important legislation, and he is proud of the work they accomplished to deliver huge results for Long Island. Johnson joked that the vote was effectively 217-214, including Garbarino and another representative who nearly missed the vote.</p>

          <p>As gold prices surge, it's important to understand common myths surrounding the precious metal. While gold prices tend to rise over time, they do experience dips, and inflation doesn't always guarantee an increase in gold prices. Additionally, waiting for a significant price drop to invest may not be a viable strategy, as gold prices generally trend upward. Investors should be strategic and informed to avoid making costly mistakes in the gold market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education following claims that its admissions policies discriminate against Asian American students. The controversy stems from changes made in 2020 to promote diversity, including the elimination of standardized testing and the implementation of a holistic review process. Virginia's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, asserts that the Fairfax County School Board intentionally reduced opportunities for Asian American students. The school district maintains that its policies are non-discriminatory and have been upheld by a federal appellate court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's MAHA Commission, chaired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., released a report outlining concerns about the health of U.S. children. The report identifies poor diet, environmental chemicals, chronic stress, lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization as major drivers of chronic illness. While reflecting concerns shared by public health researchers, the report has also faced criticism for its lack of focus on socioeconomic factors and its questioning of vaccine safety. The commission intends to use the report to develop a strategy for the administration to implement within 180 days.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports to the U.S. caused a temporary spike in the drug's street price, which reduced fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25 percent over a period of three to five months. The embargo, which added all fentanyl-related substances to China's list of controlled substances, demonstrated that cooperation between the two nations to crack down on the drug's trafficking can disrupt its supply chain and reduce overdose deaths.</p>
