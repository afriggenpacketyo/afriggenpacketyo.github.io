          <p>Above the Law, a legal industry website, has experienced a surge in readership by publishing leaks and criticisms of elite law firms that have made deals with President Trump. These firms, dubbed "The Yellow-Bellied Nine," pledged $1 billion in free legal work after Trump threatened them with punitive measures. The website, founded by David Lat, allows anonymous tipsters to expose internal conflicts and decisions within these firms. Joe Patrice, one of the site's writers, explores whether the site is being unfair in its coverage, ultimately concluding that the real intellectual leaders of the conservative legal movement are more incensed than they are. The site has also exposed law firms quietly stripping pronouns from email signatures and halting diversity initiatives.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson remains optimistic that the budget bill will reach the House floor before Memorial Day, despite failing to exit committee on Friday. The bill faces resistance from some Republicans, who are concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending.

Johnson acknowledged the potential delays in enforcing new eligibility requirements and has met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune to ensure swift passage in the Senate.

          <p>Nike's Air Jordan sneaker, the most successful basketball shoe in history, is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Howard White, a Nike veteran, recalls the initial meeting with Michael Jordan, who was offered $2.5 million to wear the shoes, triple what anyone else in the league was making at the time. Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years, but they sold $126 million in year one. Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, says Jordan is still involved with the brand. Sean Williams runs a program dedicated to studying, promoting and collecting shoes, and says it has given him his life's purpose.</p>

          <p>The ancient Hawaiian tradition of lei making is facing challenges due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the decline of local flower farms. Meleana Estes, a Hawaiian native, learned lei-making from her grandmother and emphasizes that leis are an "expression of aloha." Andrew Mau, who owns a boutique called ISLAND-BOY, is adapting by using non-traditional materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis." Despite these challenges, lei making remains a cherished tradition celebrated at the Annual Lei Day Celebration in Hawaii.</p>
