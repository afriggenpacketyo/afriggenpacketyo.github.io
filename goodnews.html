It highlights national averages for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CD yields, as well as specific rates from various banks. The article suggests strategies for obtaining good CD rates, such as considering online banks and short-term CDs. It explains the concept of the inverted yield curve and recommends laddering CDs to take advantage of high short-term rates. The score is 75. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield initially fell to 4% before rebounding as investors analyzed the latest inflation data and a jump in jobless claims. August's consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4%, with the annual inflation rate at 2.9%, while weekly jobless claims increased to 263,000. These mixed economic signals have complicated the interest rate outlook for the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting. Markets are pricing in a high probability of a quarter-point rate cut, influenced by the weaker-than-expected producer price index from the previous day. The score is 55. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey indicates that family offices are increasing their investments in stocks while reducing their allocations to private equity. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity allocations dropped to 21%. This shift is particularly noticeable among U.S. family offices, which have increased their stock allocations from 27% to 31%. Despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation, family offices are maintaining a pro-risk asset mix and are prepared to invest opportunistically during market dislocations.

Markets had priced in a 99% chance of the ECB's key deposit facility rate being left at 2% for the second consecutive time. The ECB stated that it would follow a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach and was not pre-committing to a specific path for interest rates.

Babysitting offers teens valuable skills like responsibility and critical thinking, while also providing younger children with a unique connection to someone closer to their age. The shift from teen to adult babysitters is attributed to safety concerns, busier teen schedules, and higher expectations from parents. Resurrecting the culture of teen babysitting could strengthen community ties and provide teens with valuable independence challenges. The score is 70.</p>
