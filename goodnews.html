          <p>This article explores the pressure and expectations surrounding the concept of having a "best friend," particularly among young people. While close friendships offer numerous benefits, the article emphasizes that kids don't necessarily need a single best friend to thrive. Instead, having a diverse network of supportive friends, each fulfilling different needs, can be just as valuable. Experts suggest focusing on building a repertoire of reliable individuals rather than fixating on the label of "best friend," as different friends can provide support in various aspects of life. The article encourages a broader understanding of friendship, emphasizing the importance of reliable connections over rigid definitions.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz traveled to Washington for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, with discussions expected to cover a range of topics including defense spending, trade, and the war in Ukraine. Merz indicated his willingness to discuss German domestic policy if Trump raises the subject, while also stressing Germany's non-interference in American domestic affairs. The Trump administration is reportedly concerned about "democratic backsliding" in Germany, a topic Vice President Vance addressed at the Munich Security Conference.

          <p>NBA teams have seen an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue this season, reaching $1.62 billion, largely driven by the introduction of sponsor patches on jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome.

The Intuit Dome's opening is compared to adding three new teams in terms of revenue generation. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are identified as the top-spending brands in the league. The NBA's recent $77 billion media rights deal, emphasizing streaming and broadcast TV, further underscores the league's financial strength.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who alleges she was denied a promotion and later demoted by her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, due to her heterosexual orientation. Ames claims that less qualified gay candidates were selected instead, and her supervisor was also gay. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson delivered the opinion, stating that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, but does not guarantee a successful outcome in her case against her former employer.</p>

Demand for the Switch 2 is reportedly strong, with millions entering lotteries to purchase the console in Japan. Analysts predict the Switch 2 will sell millions of units in its first year, potentially surpassing the original Switch's debut performance.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's new travel ban appears designed to avoid the legal pitfalls that plagued his initial attempt during his first term. The revised ban, impacting 12 countries, includes more clearly defined exemptions and is wider in scope than its predecessor. While similarities exist in the countries targeted, the new order does not explicitly target Muslim-majority nations, addressing a key criticism of the original ban. Legal experts note the revised ban is more legally robust and likely to withstand court challenges, drawing lessons from the previous legal battles.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with Catholic Charities, allowing the organization to opt out of participating in Wisconsin's state unemployment compensation program. The opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor, reverses a state Supreme Court decision. The ruling could potentially lead to a significant number of organizations exiting the state system in Wisconsin and similar programs in 46 other states. This exodus could destabilize the joint federal-state unemployment compensation program that has been in place for decades, potentially impacting the funding and stability of unemployment benefits for workers.</p>

          <p>The autopen, a machine used to automate a person's signature, has gained attention following allegations by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons. The device, which replicates a signature using a pen, has been utilized by presidents throughout U.S. history for routine correspondence and documents. While some presidents have been secretive about its use, the autopen has become a standard tool for signing high volumes of letters and certificates. The Justice Department has previously concluded that a president does not need to physically sign a bill for it to become law. The autopen is now a focal point of political debate.</p>

The current target is 2% of GDP, but President Trump has consistently argued that European allies and Canada do not spend enough. The new Secretary General, Mark Rutte, has proposed the 3.5% plus 1.5% compromise to avoid conflict with Trump at the upcoming summit. Only Poland currently exceeds the 3.5% target.</p>

          <p>A survey indicates that 81% of "next generation millionaires" plan to replace their parents' wealth management firms, citing poor digital offerings and a lack of desired services and products. This shift is significant as over $100 trillion is expected to transfer from older to younger generations. The next generation seeks aggressive growth, is more open to risk, and desires a broader range of investment products, including crypto and private equity. They also prioritize digital access and simplified financial education. Wealth management firms that adapt to these preferences will be better positioned to attract and retain future wealth.</p>
