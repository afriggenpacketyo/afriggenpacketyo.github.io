          <p>Dan Richards' New York Times article compares the diverging paths of night train travel in Europe and the United States. While Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train travel, driven by environmental concerns and investment in infrastructure, the United States continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting its rail system. The article argues that America's car dependence has negatively impacted mental health and that investment in rail networks could offer a more sustainable and communal mode of transportation. Richards contrasts Europe's commitment to rail infrastructure with America's focus on niche, unproven transit projects.</p>

The refugees, mostly women and children, were transported to Rwanda and will receive assistance for reintegration. The repatriation is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fiber-optic gyroscope with improved stability across a wide temperature range, according to the South China Morning Post. The article explains that this gyroscope can be used in navigation systems for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs, offering a more reliable way to measure orientation and rate of turning. Inertial navigation systems using gyroscopes are immune to external interference, making them valuable for military and security applications.</p>
