          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has presented the country's "four core principles" as a constructive approach to resolving disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants' actions and undermine maritime cooperation. China's expansive claims in the South China Sea are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Motivational speaker Tony Robbins cautions that relying on Social Security as the primary foundation for retirement planning is a risky strategy. He argues that the average monthly Social Security benefit is insufficient for most Americans and that the program's sustainability is uncertain. Robbins encourages working-age Americans to create their own nest egg by saving approximately 20 times their annual expenses and adhering to the 4% withdrawal rule. He emphasizes the importance of investing early and diversifying portfolios to build a robust retirement fund. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that sleeping positions, particularly side and stomach sleeping, can contribute to wrinkles and premature skin sagging due to compression and friction against the pillow. These positions weaken collagen and elastin, leading to sleep lines and asymmetry, especially in delicate areas like the cheeks and d√©collet√©. Back sleeping is recommended as the most skin-friendly position, preventing direct contact between the face and pillow and reducing fluid buildup. Interventions like silicone chest pads, retinoids, and in-office treatments such as Botox and RF microneedling can help prevent and treat sleep-positional aging.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the recent Holyrood by-election, alleging that the SNP's tactics pushed voters towards Reform UK. Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark by claiming Labour's vote share had collapsed and that SNP data showed a surge for Reform. Labour won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat unexpectedly. Sarwar urged the UK government to deliver changes that would put extra money in people's pockets.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that President Trump's policies have diminished the perceived threat of "peaceful evolution" in China, a concept that once fueled concerns about American conspiracies to subvert the Communist Party. The author, reflecting on their upbringing in China, notes that Mao Zedong warned about the threat of American imperialists using Western values to incite dissent. However, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and vowed to stop lecturing others on governance, leading to a decline in the perceived threat of peaceful evolution.</p>

The airline typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the route. Passengers were bused from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours, and American Airlines apologized for the disruption.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, and 40% are over 60, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field, with median pay for aircraft technicians around $79,140 a year.

          <p>This article explores how a Chinese movie called "Clash," about a Chinese American-football team, reflects the changing dynamics between the U.S. and China. The author, who originally wrote an article about the real team that inspired the film, discusses how the project was initially courted by Hollywood but ultimately produced by a Chinese studio. The shift highlights China's growing self-reliance in entertainment and the increasing distance between the two countries' cultural understanding. The author concludes that while a collaborative version would have been ideal, the Chinese version offers an authentic perspective.</p>
