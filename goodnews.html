          <p>Contrary to a common narrative, a new survey of American women aged 25 to 55 indicates that married mothers report being "very happy" more often than unmarried women and married women without children. The research suggests that while motherhood presents challenges, it also provides a profound sense of meaning and purpose that contributes to overall life satisfaction. The study also highlights benefits of marriage, such as reduced loneliness and the positive effects of physical affection, challenging pessimistic views on family life.</p>

          <p>Spot bitcoin ETFs attracted significant net inflows of $332.7 million on Tuesday, while Ethereum-based funds saw outflows of $135.3 million, suggesting a market rotation back toward Bitcoin. This shift contrasts with August, when Ethereum ETFs dominated investor interest due to factors like staking yields and positive regulatory signals. Historically, September has been a weaker month for Ethereum, and analysts suggest investors may be moving to Bitcoin as a safer benchmark asset amid broader market caution.

          <p>As global water scarcity increases, desalination is becoming more common, but the process creates a highly salty byproduct called brine that can harm marine ecosystems. The article explores emerging technologies and strategies to make desalination more environmentally friendly, such as advanced dilution techniques and "brine mining," which extracts valuable minerals like lithium from the waste. Experts suggest that combining these innovations with renewable energy sources and careful site selection can make desalination a more sustainable solution for freshwater needs.</p>
