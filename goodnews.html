          <h2>Germany Implements Measures to Cope with Extreme Heat and Climate Change Effects</h2>

          <p>Germany is grappling with the challenges of climate change as it experiences increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, with temperatures recently soaring to nearly 40°C (104°F). In response, authorities are focusing on public information campaigns, such as the hitzeservice.de website, to advise citizens on safety, particularly the elderly and ill. While the federal government provides support, local authorities are primarily responsible for direct action, and the army remains on standby to assist with related crises like wildfires. Health experts warn of the serious risks of heat-related illnesses, emphasizing the need for proactive climate protection to prevent summer from becoming a dangerous season.</p>

          <p>Former television host Ellen DeGeneres has publicly stated that her decision to move to the United Kingdom was a direct result of Donald Trump's re-election as US president. During an appearance in Cheltenham, she explained that she and her wife, Portia de Rossi, decided to remain in England permanently after waking up to the election results. DeGeneres also touched on the allegations of a toxic workplace at her former talk show, dismissing the stories as "clickbait" while admitting she can be a "very blunt" person. She expressed a love for the simpler, more polite way of life in the UK and is even considering remarrying there amid concerns over LGBTQ+ rights in the US.</p>

          <p>Famed New York City restaurateur Keith McNally has released a new memoir, "I Regret Almost Everything," detailing his life, career, and personal struggles. In the book and a recent interview, he candidly discusses the severe stroke he suffered in 2016, which led to a suicide attempt two years later and forced him to overcome embarrassment about his impaired speech by using social media. McNally also reflects on his controversial public call-out of James Corden, admitting he was "intoxicated with self-righteousness" and now feels bad about the humiliation he caused. The memoir offers a raw look at the man behind iconic eateries like Balthazar and The Odeon.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that he expects the next two weeks to be historic for U.S. trade, predicting major deals will be finalized before an August 1st tariff deadline. The Trump administration has sent letters to key partners, including the European Union and Canada, threatening steep new tariffs unless agreements are reached. Lutnick stated this pressure has successfully brought countries to the negotiating table, where they must either open their markets to U.S. goods or face the tariffs. He also aggressively criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of "torturing America" by keeping interest rates too high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030, addressing public fury over the state of the nation's waterways. This marks the first time the government has set a specific target on spill numbers, following data showing serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The pledge comes ahead of a landmark review expected to recommend major reforms, potentially including the dissolution of the regulator Ofwat, which has been criticized for failing to hold companies accountable for pollution while executives receive large bonuses.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. This skill is said to build emotional resilience, support healthy boundaries, and foster authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. The article suggests that parents can cultivate this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming all emotions, and modeling their own self-connection. Small shifts in language and behavior can help children develop a strong sense of self-worth that lasts into adulthood.</p>

This potential meeting follows recent efforts by both nations to stabilize fluctuating relations, which have been strained by threats of heavy tariffs on Chinese goods. A recent meeting between the US Secretary of State and the Chinese Foreign Minister, along with a phone call where the leaders exchanged invitations, indicates a mutual desire to de-escalate tensions.

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a resurgence as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town withered after being bypassed by the faster I-40 interstate in the 1970s, a fate shared by many small towns along the route. Local residents and business owners are now banding together to prepare for an expected influx of tourists, planning new events, history tours, and a vintage trailer campground. They hope the centennial will breathe new life into their community, which they describe as a slice of Americana "frozen in time."</p>
