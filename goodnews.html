          <p>The European Union is allocating ‚Ç¨5.5 million in emergency funding to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) following the broadcaster's loss of US public funding due to the Trump administration's accusations of liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the importance of Radio Free Europe in countering authoritarian regimes, noting its historical role in delivering news to people under communist rule. The funding will prioritize regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus, aiming to maintain independent journalism in areas heavily reliant on external news sources, though it won't cover all of RFE's 27 languages and 23 countries. Radio Free Europe's lawyers are challenging the funding cuts in court.</p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, defeating the incumbent Ed Gainey, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leadership. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but the Democratic primary win is considered tantamount to winning the mayoral election in Pittsburgh. Gainey, the city‚Äôs first Black mayor, focused on affordable housing but faced criticism for police leadership turnover and basic service complaints. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would focus on rebuilding the city's tax base and adopting a conciliatory approach toward powerful institutions.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice because supporters gift him so much, which sparked outrage amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister. Eto's comments came shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. The resignation comes as Ishiba faces a House of Councillors election and amid public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising rice prices.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey was defeated in the Democratic primary by Corey O'Connor, who had support from the party's "old guard" and some Republicans. O'Connor received financial support from Republican donors and focused his campaign on resourcing the police and revitalizing the downtown area. Gainey, the city's first Black mayor, had positioned himself as a critic of President Trump and worked to attract new business to Pittsburgh. Under Gainey, the city saw population growth and an increase in affordable housing, but O'Connor successfully challenged him with a pro-police stance and promises to improve the city's economy.</p>

          <p>China's youth unemployment rate decreased in April, dropping to 15.8% from 16.5% in March, as the country prepares for a record number of university graduates entering the job market.

An estimated 12.22 million students are expected to graduate from Chinese universities this year. The high youth unemployment rate remains a significant issue as the economy struggles to generate sufficient high-quality jobs for the growing number of graduates.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumour types from weeks to hours, which surgeons are calling a "game changer." The "ultra-rapid" genetic testing method, developed at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumour types in as little as 90 minutes. This allows for more informed surgical decisions and faster treatment for patients. Several other NHS hospitals are also setting up their own testing alongside their existing regimes to gather more evidence about its effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a first-of-its-kind move. Under the proposal, Nebraska will establish a program, beginning in January 2026 and affecting some 150,000 food stamp recipients in the state. Nebraska, in its waiver application, said it would regularly survey participants in the state to evaluate changes in their spending habits and examine retailer data to assess reductions in purchases of soda and energy drinks.
