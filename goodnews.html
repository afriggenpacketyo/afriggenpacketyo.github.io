        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millennials entering their 40s are experiencing midlife differently than previous generations, marked by economic instability, career reevaluations, and a search for personal fulfillment. Unlike the stereotypical midlife crisis involving drastic changes like abandoning family, millennials often face challenges such as financial insecurity and a lack of traditional milestones. Many are seeking opportunities for personal growth, such as fitness journeys or career changes, rather than interventions. The article suggests that understanding the millennial midlife crisis requires deconstructing traditional notions and acknowledging the unique circumstances shaping this generation's experience. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how addressing the climate crisis requires more than just quitting fossil fuels; it also necessitates addressing the environmental impact of food production, which accounts for one-third of the climate problem. Agriculture's vast footprint, driven by the expansion of crops and pastures, leads to deforestation, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. The challenge lies in increasing food production to feed a growing population while simultaneously reducing agriculture's environmental impact. Innovations in agriculture, dietary changes, and policy shifts are essential to achieving a sustainable food system and mitigating climate change. </p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls, potentially setting the stage for a shift in the country's trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies on China and North Korea. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was previously in doubt due to charges of breaching election laws, but a ruling was postponed until after the election. Analysts predict Lee will likely pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and renegotiating trade deals with the U.S. While both candidates share similar goals, they differ in their approaches to economic policy. </p>

          <p>Germany's Constitutional Court has rejected a challenge by the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) to the results of February's parliamentary elections. The BSW narrowly missed the 5% threshold required for representation in the Bundestag. The party argued that its placement on election ballots and the failure to carry out a recount violated its right to equal opportunity. The court rejected the arguments, stating that the applicant did not sufficiently substantiate the possibility of a violation of its right to equal opportunities. </p>
