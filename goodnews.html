          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), set to eliminate most tariffs on EU exports and open investment in key sectors like electric vehicles. The deal, which also addresses critical raw materials for Europe, was reportedly expedited due to US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, creating a need for new trade alliances. Officials estimate the agreement will save EU exporters approximately €600 million in annual duties and provide greater access to Indonesia's large consumer market.</p>

          <p>Danish renewable energy firm Orsted saw its shares jump significantly after a U.S. federal court issued a preliminary injunction, overturning a stop-work order from the Trump administration. This ruling allows the company to resume construction on its nearly finished Revolution Wind farm, a major project located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The decision provides a significant reprieve for Orsted, which has faced major setbacks due to the administration's policies suspending new wind leases and favoring fossil fuel industries.

Citing recent escalations by Beijing, including the use of water cannons and efforts to control Scarborough Shoal, the committee warned that undermining this support would threaten U.S. national security interests.</p>

          <p>This article examines the scientific consensus regarding the causes of autism, contrasting it with President Trump's recent claims linking the condition to the painkiller Tylenol (acetaminophen). Medical experts and researchers emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong polygenetic roots, meaning hundreds of gene variants and environmental factors likely play a role. They state that the idea of a single medication ingredient being a primary cause is scientifically untenable, and that the rise in diagnoses is better explained by increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England has introduced a new guideline called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The initiative is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from undiagnosed cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The rule aims to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or make specialist referrals to prevent tragic and avoidable diagnostic misses, particularly among younger patients.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is returning to the air after ABC ended his "indefinite" suspension, a move widely seen as a response to a significant public relations crisis for the network and its parent company, Disney. Kimmel was suspended for comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which were criticized as insensitive and inaccurate. The suspension drew widespread condemnation from free speech advocates, celebrities, and government officials, creating immense pressure on Disney to reverse its decision and avoid being labeled as an opponent of free expression.</p>

It details how captain Tony Jacklin transformed the European team's mindset and professional standards, demanding better travel, attire, and preparation to match their American counterparts. This shift in approach, combined with the emergence of stars like Seve Ballesteros, led to a historic victory at The Belfry that ended a 28-year U.S. unbeaten streak and set the stage for the intense rivalry seen today.</p>

Despite the delay, Perdue characterized the relationship between the two leaders as "very good and very encouraging," as both sides work to manage their complex geopolitical and economic relationship.</p>

The ruling states that the administration likely violated federal law by not providing specific reasons for the cuts, which targeted hundreds of medical research grants. The funding freeze was part of a broader administration effort to pressure elite universities over alleged civil rights violations related to antisemitism and diversity initiatives, which critics have described as politically motivated attacks on higher education.</p>

The piece notes how Allardyce was ahead of his time in using data analytics and even watching games from the stands for a better tactical overview, ideas that are becoming more mainstream as coaches seek new competitive edges.</p>
