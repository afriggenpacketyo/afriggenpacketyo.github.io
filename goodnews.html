          <p>Kimbal Musk, brother to Elon Musk, publicly affirmed that the Tesla CEO "deserves to be paid," noting Elon has received no cash salary for six to eight years, relying instead on performance-based stock options. This statement arises as Tesla navigates a legal challenge following a Delaware judge's revocation of Elon's 2018 $56 billion pay package. An "interim" $29 billion package was subsequently approved by a special committee of the board without a shareholder vote, prompting an investment group to call for an investigation by Nasdaq. The board plans to put a longer-term compensation strategy to a shareholder vote in November. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the city's inaugural autonomous vehicle testing launch, with Waymo deploying up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. New York state law mandates a human driver behind the wheel during these tests. This expansion follows Waymo's growth in other cities and its recent milestone of surpassing 10 million robotaxi trips, signaling a significant step towards integrating autonomous technology into dense urban environments.</p>

DeepSeek previously demonstrated strong AI capabilities despite US controls, and this move could further bolster China's independent AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting local chipmakers like Huawei.

          <h2>Fed Chair Powell Signals Potential Rate Cuts Amid Shifting Economic Risks and Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 10:10:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his Jackson Hole speech, cautiously indicated potential interest rate cuts, citing a "challenging situation" with shifting economic risks. He noted that while the labor market is resilient, downside dangers are rising, and tariffs pose a risk of renewed inflation. Powell emphasized the Fed would "proceed carefully" but acknowledged that current policy in "restrictive territory" and the changing balance of risks "may warrant adjusting our policy stance." This statement, interpreted by markets as a signal for a September rate cut, comes amidst political pressure from President Trump for aggressive rate reductions, though Powell reaffirmed the Fed's independence.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian, which published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest. Over a dozen women testified to experiencing misconduct during the six-week trial, with the judge finding Clarke "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejecting his claim of an "unlawful conspiracy." The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a victory for the women who suffered and a landmark for investigative journalism.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments (TI) is undertaking a $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject, with Apple committing to produce "critical foundation semiconductors" for iPhones at TI's new plants in Utah and Texas. This initiative aligns with President Trump's tariff policy to incentivize domestic chip production. Despite a recent 13% stock plunge for TI due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts view TI as a "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundry's potential to undercut rivals. The project, involving seven new fabs, aims to quintuple TI's capacity and address the decline in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank stated that the club is only interested in signing players fully committed to wearing their badge, following missed transfer opportunities. This declaration comes after Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze, who was reportedly poised for a move to Spurs, instead joined rivals Arsenal in a £67.5 million deal. It marks the second blow for Tottenham this summer, as Morgan Gibbs-White also opted for a new contract at Nottingham Forest after Spurs activated a release clause.

          <p>John Deere is at a critical juncture, experiencing weaker demand in the agricultural sector, leading to significant drops in net income and sales, and recent layoffs. Farmers are reducing spending due to lower crop prices and rising costs. Despite these challenges, the company is investing $20 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, buoyed by growth in Europe and South America, and positive tailwinds from trade and tax policies. Analysts suggest 2025 might be the "worst" for tractor sales, but see long-term potential for a rebound, especially in precision agriculture, noting Deere's disciplined management to avoid overproduction.

          <p>Conservation biologists have successfully transformed Florida's Avon Park Air Force Range, a military bombing site, into a sanctuary for the threatened red-cockaded woodpecker. Through translocation efforts between 1998 and 2016, 54 woodpeckers were moved, with approximately 70% surviving and forming breeding pairs, leading to offspring with stronger survival rates. This project not only boosted numbers but also restored genetic diversity, demonstrating translocation's potential as a conservation method when combined with habitat management. The species, once common, has faced dramatic decline due to habitat loss but was reclassified from "endangered" to "threatened" in 2024, with Avon Park playing a key role.</p>

While tariff costs are rising, consumer spending has remained steady, with some exceptions among lower-income shoppers. Retail executives, including Walmart's CFO, noted selective price increases but emphasized efforts to keep prices low. The article highlights that strong brands and new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are helping companies absorb costs, though some brands anticipate profit margin hits and reduced orders.
