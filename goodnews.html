          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted he wrongly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities, it was revealed the crew was raising money for motor neurone disease research. Lowe later apologized for the "false alarm" and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" as they were met by police and a drone after their boat was reported.</p>

The statements address growing nationalist fears in Mexico, fueled by the U.S. designation of several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at a White House summit hosted by President Trump, aiming to end decades of conflict. The deal establishes a new transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, which will be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." This U.S.-brokered agreement marks a significant geopolitical shift, diminishing Russia's long-standing influence as a mediator in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, which pleased President Trump, eased investor fears about the potential impact of tariffs on the company's profitability, as Trump suggested Apple would be exempt from future chip tariffs.

          <p>A Realtor.com report indicates that U.S. home prices are declining in some regions, particularly in the South and West, while remaining high in the Northeast and Midwest. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops of nearly 15% and 19% respectively since 2022, driven by increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest face tight inventory and stricter building regulations, causing prices in cities like Milwaukee to climb over 26%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported narrower second-quarter losses and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is used in high-strength magnets for electric vehicles and electronics. The positive results follow a recent $400 million investment from the Department of Defense, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder and signaling a strategic push to secure domestic rare earth supply chains. The company is now focused on scaling up magnet production at its Texas facility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is leveraging bipartisan federal initiatives, including the Infrastructure Law and Defense Production Act, to bolster its domestic mining and refining capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China. A key project is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, supported by a $114 million Department of Energy grant, which will process ore for EV batteries. This reflects a continued federal strategy, started under the Biden administration and expanded by Trump, to secure strategic materials considered vital for both clean energy and national security.

Instead of pushing through mental blocks, taking short breaks for activities like walking or dancing can effectively reset one's mood and perspective. The piece suggests practical tips, such as taking phone calls while walking and tidying one's workspace, and encourages working with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than against them to improve productivity and well-being.</p>
