          <p>President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are scheduled to meet at the White House, amidst strained relations due to tariffs and annexation suggestions. Carney won his election with an anti-Trump message, and this meeting follows his initial decision to visit Europe first, a break from tradition. The meeting aims to balance standing up for Canada while avoiding conflict with Trump, with Carney cautioning against expecting immediate breakthroughs on a new trade deal. Separately, the Justice Department is seeking to dismiss a case restricting abortion access, and Trump announced a 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that U.S. contractors are optimistic about business conditions, anticipating improvements and reporting healthy project backlogs, which is an encouraging sign for Home Depot. The survey, conducted by Morgan Stanley, found that contractors are seeing increased demand for larger projects and are less concerned about clients opting for smaller jobs. However, contractors expressed concerns about material pricing due to inflation and tariff uncertainty. Home Depot remains confident in its ability to navigate the economic landscape, emphasizing the need for home improvements in aging U.S. houses. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to meet with President Trump after winning the Canadian election, which was influenced by Trump's threats of annexing Canada. Trump's remarks and actions during the election were viewed as foreign interference, boosting Carney's campaign. Carney's Liberals won a minority government, and he is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House. The election saw the defeat of Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, and Carney's victory is partly attributed to his focus on Trump's threats. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, has stated that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek is "six to eight months behind where US frontier companies are," despite recent hype surrounding the company. Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's technology has clever algorithmic ideas but suggested it would need more computing power to compete effectively. His assessment comes amid speculation about DeepSeek's next-generation models, with the company having recently open-sourced its Prover-V2 model. Clark's comments provide a perspective on the competitive landscape in the AI industry. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <h2>Americans Push Back Against 'Tip-Creep' as Gratuities Fall From Pandemic Peak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 06:00:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Americans are increasingly pushing back against the expansion of tipping culture, with gratuities falling from a pandemic peak as tip requests become ubiquitous in unexpected places. The rise of electronic point-of-sale systems is contributing to "tip-creep," prompting some consumers to reduce or eliminate tips in certain situations. While some individuals are choosing to tip more generously due to economic hardships, others are opting for a "countercultural" approach by not tipping at all in establishments covered by regular minimum wage laws. President Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has drawn criticism for potentially incentivizing the spread of tipping culture and low wages. Optimism score: 60</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new poll reveals that over 90% of Americans use federal science information, such as weather forecasts and job market reports, on a weekly basis, but only 10% are concerned about potential impacts from cuts to federal science funding. The Association of Science and Technology Centers conducted the poll to understand attitudes about science and inform how science centers can better serve the public. The poll indicates a gap between the use of federal science information and understanding its source. While political polarization exists around trust in science, the poll also found agreement across party lines about the importance of federal investment in STEM education. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Officials in Southern California are reporting promising results from the release of sterile male mosquitoes to combat the invasive Aedes aegypti mosquito, which has contributed to a recent surge in local dengue fever transmission. The releases led to significant reductions in mosquito populations in treated areas, with one agency reporting an 82% reduction. The approach is considered environmentally friendly as it does not involve spraying chemicals. Despite these positive results, challenges remain in scaling the intervention to larger areas, and climate change continues to enable the spread of Aedes mosquitoes. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>In this podcast, The Atlantic explores the shift from the Riot Grrrl movement to the Spice Girls, the rise of postfeminism, and the influence of technology and porn on the culture. The episode discusses how the celebration of sex became commercialized and how that influenced the perception of power. There is also a discussion about the importance of education and media literacy. Gilbert and Demsas delve into the role of women's complicity in sexism, and if the emphasis on individual agency is a detriment to the feminist movement as a whole. Optimism score: 60</p>
