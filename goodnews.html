          <p>Former President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling support for the Japanese company's investment in the American producer, while also stating that U.S. Steel would continue to be controlled by the USA. During a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent, emphasizing national security concerns. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, a move that faced scrutiny during Trump's first term; despite the praise, Trump mentioned he still needs to approve the final deal between the two steelmakers.

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels from 2019, however, their travel style has shifted from large group tours and shopping sprees to immersive experiences. The Japan National Tourism Organization reports that travelers now seek authentic Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. This change is driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, opting for family trips over traditional group tours. The JNTO is adapting its marketing strategies to target this evolving demographic.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, restrained a man who allegedly tried to open an emergency exit door mid-flight from Tokyo to Houston.

          <p>China is upgrading its traditional mining industry with advanced technologies, exemplified by the deployment of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks at the Yimin open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia. This initiative addresses driver shortages and dangerous working conditions, as younger generations show declining interest in the profession. The move is part of China's push to digitally transform its coal industry, aligning with the construction of intelligent mines and the adoption of autonomous driving as a strategic goal.

          <p>An appeals court refused to freeze a California judge's order halting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, meaning that cuts led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) remain on pause. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the White House's request to freeze the injunction, stating that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers. The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco, who questioned the legality of the workforce reductions.</p>
