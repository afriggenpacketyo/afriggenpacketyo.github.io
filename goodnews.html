The Prowess microdrone, weighing less than 250 grams, surpassed a limit that had remained unbroken for three years, marking a significant advancement in micro-unmanned aerial vehicle technology. Xu's achievement highlights the growing innovation in drone technology within China's burgeoning low-altitude economy, showcasing the potential for further developments in this field.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration is close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, signaling a potential breakthrough in long-standing tensions. However, the exact terms of the deal remain unclear, with key sticking points including Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. Iranian officials insist on maintaining their right to civilian nuclear energy and refuse to dismantle enrichment facilities. Despite these challenges, both sides have engaged in constructive negotiations mediated by Oman, indicating a mutual interest in resolving the dispute diplomatically and averting war, with the possibility of a joint nuclear-enrichment venture being proposed.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House amid tensions over the Trump administration's new policy granting refugee status to Afrikaners, a white ethnic minority in South Africa. The visit aims to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries. The Trump administration cites "egregious discrimination" against Afrikaners as the reason for the new policy, while Ramaphosa rejects this characterization and has criticized those leaving for the U.S. as "cowardly". The situation is further complicated by a new law in South Africa allowing the state to seize land without compensation, raising concerns among Afrikaners.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, former U.S. CEO of Walmart, believes the retailer can easily absorb tariff costs without raising prices, suggesting the company may be overstating challenges. He points to Walmart's growing gross profit margin and price deflation in general merchandise categories as indicators of financial flexibility. Simon is optimistic that consumers can handle price increases due to a steady jobs market and cheaper fuel prices, but warns that negative commentary from corporate executives could erode consumer confidence. He suggests Walmart has room to manage any tariff impact without passing costs onto consumers.</p>

          <p>Israel has qualified for the Eurovision Song Contest final, despite protests and attempts to disrupt the country's dress rehearsal. Yuval Raphael, Israel's contestant, performed "New Day Will Rise" during a preview show when protesters with Palestinian flags tried to obstruct her act. The incident did not disrupt Raphael's performance, and her appearance in the semi-final passed without further demonstrations. Her song is currently among the favorites to win, despite the ongoing tension.</p>

          <p>Charl Kleinhaus, a 46-year-old Afrikaner, defends his refugee status in the US, stating he left South Africa after receiving death threats. He was moved to the US under President Trump's policy to protect Afrikaners from alleged discrimination. Kleinhaus says he left behind his home, car, dogs, and mother, emphasizing the seriousness of his situation. He is grateful to Trump for recognizing the challenges he faced and providing safety for his children.</p>
