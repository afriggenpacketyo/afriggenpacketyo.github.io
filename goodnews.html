          <p>A heartwarming moment at a Seattle Mariners game captured national attention after a fan, Glenn Mutti-Driscoll, caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball and immediately gifted it to 12-year-old Marcus Rueblos. The boy then chose to return the potentially valuable ball to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat. In a final act of goodwill, the Mariners organization located Mutti-Driscoll and rewarded his generosity with a meet-and-greet and a signed bat from the star catcher.</p>

          <h2>FAA Eases Restrictions, Allowing Boeing to Self-Certify Some 737 MAX and 787 Aircraft</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has announced it will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for certain new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner planes. This decision reverses strict oversight measures implemented in 2019 and 2022 following fatal crashes and production defects. The FAA stated that this step forward is based on confidence in Boeing's improved production quality and will allow federal inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance, signaling a major milestone in the manufacturer's recovery.</p>

          <p>A retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach suggests converting one-third of one's retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential living expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio remain accessible for investment growth, unexpected costs, or discretionary spending, aiming for a balance between financial security and flexibility.

Commenting on the recent U.S.-China deal regarding TikTok, he stressed that the key issues to watch are the security of American user data and the ownership of the app's powerful algorithm. Clegg also warned against the trend of data localization, where countries require citizen data to be stored domestically, as it could erode the open internet.</p>
