          <p>Global defense stocks experienced a significant rally after President Donald Trump announced a major shift in his stance, stating that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. In a social media post, Trump described Russia as a "paper tiger" facing economic trouble, a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede land for peace. European defense firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab saw their share prices climb, reflecting market reaction to the potential for prolonged or intensified conflict and increased military support for Ukraine.

          <p>Members of the American team for the 2025 Ryder Cup have drawn criticism on social media for their fashion choices at the event's pre-tournament gala dinner. The golfers were photographed wearing suits paired with sneakers and no ties, an informal look that many fans and golf purists deemed inappropriate for the prestigious occasion. The controversy adds a minor social storyline to the highly anticipated tournament at Bethpage Black, where Team USA, led by Scottie Scheffler, will compete against Team Europe, led by Rory McIlroy. The competition itself is set to begin on Friday.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This statement, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine might have to concede territory to end the war with Russia. Trump attributed his change in perspective to a better understanding of the military situation and Russia's "BIG Economic trouble," labeling the nation a "paper tiger." The shift was welcomed by President Zelensky as a positive signal of continued U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show with an impassioned monologue, directly addressing his recent suspension and the political pressure from President Donald Trump. While expressing regret that his comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death were perceived as insensitive, he did not apologize and instead pivoted to a forceful defense of free speech, calling government threats to silence a comedian "anti-American." Kimmel criticized Trump's attempts to have him canceled and warned that the president was escalating his battle with the media. The host's defiant return has been framed as a significant moment in the ongoing conflict between the media and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has signaled a desire for more stable and constructive ties with Canada during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in New York. Speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Li emphasized the need for both nations to adopt a "correct" perception of each other to foster a "healthy, stable and sustainable" partnership. The discussion was described by Carney as "very constructive." This diplomatic engagement comes after a period of strained relations, which worsened last year after Canada imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, in partnership with Oracle, has officially opened its first data center in Abilene, Texas, as the flagship site for the ambitious $500 billion Stargate infrastructure project. This initiative aims to build the massive computing power required for the future of artificial intelligence, with additional sites planned for New Mexico and Ohio. The Texas campus, filled with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips, could eventually scale to over a gigawatt of capacity. OpenAI's finance chief, Sarah Friar, highlighted the "massive compute crunch" and stated that this large-scale construction is essential to meet the growing demands of advanced AI models.

          <p>The ambition of sending humans to Mars faces a significant hurdle: the human body is not equipped for long-duration spaceflight, which can cause accelerated osteoporosis, muscle loss, and radiation damage. The emerging field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, but progress is slow due to the small number of people who have been to space. Research, such as NASA's twin study, has revealed significant physiological changes, including DNA damage and cardiovascular stress. Experts argue that before a Mars settlement is feasible, major breakthroughs are needed in areas like radiation protection and understanding reproduction in microgravity.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that California Democrats are shifting from a purely resistance-based posture against President Trump to a more pragmatic and centrist governing model. Citing examples like San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie's focus on crime and housing, and statewide reforms to environmental laws to speed up construction, the article argues that the party is responding to voter concerns about affordability and quality of life. This new approach involves making difficult choices, such as moderating plans for immigrant healthcare coverage, to balance principles with practicality. The author posits that this shift towards results-oriented governance could serve as a model for the national Democratic party.</p>

          <p>A delivery driver in Sweetwater, Texas, is being praised for helping to thwart a potential hostage situation after reporting a suspicious order. The driver alerted police after delivering items including zip ties, a hatchet, trash bags, and bleach to a motel room. When officers investigated, they found an armed man, 42-year-old Neil Cooper, who had taken a person hostage inside the room. After negotiations, Cooper surrendered and was arrested on charges of aggravated kidnapping, while the hostage was safely recovered. The driver's alertness and quick action have been widely commended for preventing a potentially violent crime.</p>

          <p>American club soccer is experiencing a significant stadium boom, reflecting a strategic shift towards real estate as a foundation for sustainable growth. Across Major League Soccer, the NWSL, and the lower-division USL, teams are increasingly playing in soccer-specific venues they control, providing stability and a physical footprint in their communities. This trend is particularly notable in women's soccer, with the Kansas City Current opening the first stadium built specifically for a women's team. As the USL plans for promotion and relegation, having dedicated stadiums is seen as crucial for ensuring clubs can survive financially even if they are relegated.</p>

Confusing his time zones, McIlroy required a high-speed police escort to reach the course just minutes before he would have forfeited, a result that would have doomed Europe's historic comeback. The incident, which saw U.S. fans taunting him about his tee time, is seen as a pivotal moment that transformed the young star into the passionate Ryder Cup warrior he is today.

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 70-year-old Southern California man who spent 38 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, has accepted a $25 million settlement from the city of Inglewood. Hastings was exonerated in 2023 after DNA evidence, which he had requested to be tested as early as 2000, finally proved his innocence. The biological evidence from the 1983 sexual assault and murder of Roberta Wydermyer ultimately pointed to a different man, a serial rapist who died in 2020. Hastings' lawsuit alleged that Inglewood police detectives fabricated evidence and ignored witness accounts that pointed to the real perpetrator.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while society has rightly focused on advancing girls and women, a significant and often ignored crisis is affecting boys and men. The author points to a widening gender gap in higher education, where nearly 60% of college students are now women, as well as higher rates of suicide and drug overdoses among men. The article criticizes the tendency to blame "toxic masculinity" rather than examining systemic failures in education and healthcare, noting there are federal offices for women's health but none for men's. It calls for a more compassionate and balanced approach to address these disparities.</p>

          <p>With conflicting polls on California's Proposition 50, the state's redistricting measure, this article offers guidance on how to critically evaluate survey data. It cautions against treating polls as infallible predictions and advises voters to examine a poll's methodology. Key factors to consider include the sample size, the duration of the survey, whether it was conducted in multiple languages, and the precise wording of the questions. The piece also warns of potential bias in polls conducted by partisan groups with a specific agenda. Ultimately, it suggests that a well-informed decision is more valuable than relying on horse-race polling.</p>

The ASA ruled that insufficient care was taken to prevent the ad from reaching minors, given the show's popularity with young people and the nature of TikTok's algorithm. The regulator also banned two other Facebook ads from Au Vodka for featuring influencers who were, or appeared to be, under the age of 25, in violation of UK advertising codes.</p>
