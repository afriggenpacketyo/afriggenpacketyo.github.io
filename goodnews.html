          <p>Officials in Texas Hill Country announced that the number of people unaccounted for following devastating holiday weekend floods has dropped from over 100 to just three. The significant reduction comes after extensive verification efforts by local, state, and federal agencies identified many initially reported missing as safe. The historic flash floods claimed at least 135 lives, primarily along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. Recovery efforts for the remaining missing persons are ongoing as state lawmakers prepare to address flood-related issues and warning systems.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved violent clashes between striking miners and thousands of police officers outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations that police falsified evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>The artisanal mezcal industry in Oaxaca, Mexico, is experiencing a significant boom, emerging from the shadow of its more famous cousin, tequila.

The article follows the Hernandez brothers, whose family distillery Mal de Amor grew from a small local operation to a major exporter in partnership with the Ilegal brand. This growth has brought economic prosperity to their community while raising questions about preserving artisanal traditions amid international commercial success.</p>

          <p>Following a recent viral incident, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned concertgoers in Wisconsin that they might be shown on the venue's large screens. During the "Jumbotron Song" segment, he advised the audience to "do your makeup now," alluding to a previous show where a couple was caught on camera in an awkward embrace. That couple was later identified online as the CEO and HR head of a tech company, leading to the CEO's resignation. The band has not directly addressed the fallout from the viral moment, which has since become a popular internet meme.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships asserts that the most crucial skill for a child's lifelong success is "self-connection." This skill involves the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions and needs, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. The author provides practical tips for parents, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to foster this essential internal foundation in their children.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable and homeless housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. With a $300 million investment fund, the organization is bidding on several large-scale projects in Los Angeles, proposing to finance them with a mix of private equity and conventional loans. This model aims to reduce costs and construction time compared to the traditional, slow process of securing government tax credits and grants. While the resulting rents may not be as low as heavily subsidized projects, the goal is to attract capitalist investment to solve the housing crisis.</p>

The move is part of a broader overhaul of the sector, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and record levels of sewage pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the industry as "broken" and its regulator as "failing," signaling that significant reforms are forthcoming.</p>
