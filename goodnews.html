          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement between the AI company Anthropic and a group of authors and publishers. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally used nearly half a million pirated books to train its Claude chatbot models. Under the agreement, authors and publishers will receive approximately $3,000 for each book involved, although it does not cover future works. The Authors Guild hailed the settlement as a milestone that sends a clear message to AI companies about the high cost of copyright infringement. The case resolves claims about how the training materials were obtained, while a previous ruling on AI training as "fair use" remains intact.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that he "will not allow" Israel to annex the occupied West Bank, a move long advocated by far-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. The statement comes amid growing international pressure on Israel to end the war in Gaza and as numerous Western nations have formally recognized a Palestinian state. Trump, who is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu, also mentioned that a deal regarding Gaza was "pretty close." The announcement follows meetings with Arab leaders who warned of the severe risks associated with annexation, signaling a significant U.S. policy stance on the contentious issue.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Inspired by Waking Infant Could Regulate Loud Commercials on Streaming Services</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California bill, SB 576, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing them from being significantly louder than the programs they interrupt. The legislation was inspired by the experience of a legislative aide whose sleeping baby was repeatedly awakened by blaring ads. While a 2010 federal law, the CALM Act, already governs commercial volume for broadcast and cable TV, it does not apply to streaming platforms. Because of California's market size, the bill could effectively set a new national standard if signed into law by the governor, as companies are unlikely to create separate policies for the state.</p>

          <p>A diverse field of candidates running for Governor of California in 2026 offered their assessments of Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure and outlined their own priorities. In a series of interviews, Democratic contenders like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's efforts in areas such as healthcare and the economy, while also identifying areas for improvement like the housing crisis. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco and business owner Leo Zacky, were highly critical, struggling to name anything the governor or legislature had done well. The responses highlight the deep partisan divide and the key issues, such as housing costs and fiscal accountability, that will define the upcoming gubernatorial race.</p>

          <h2>Pfizer's Acquisition of Metsera Expected to Influence Chinese Obesity Drug Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 20:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer's potential $7.3 billion acquisition of Metsera, a developer of next-generation weight-loss drugs, is anticipated to stimulate further investment in innovative obesity treatments in China. Analysts believe the major deal signals continued strong interest from global pharmaceutical giants in the lucrative weight-loss market. This will likely encourage Chinese companies already active in this space to increase their research and development spending. Metsera is focused on developing drugs that offer better efficacy and tolerability with less frequent injections than current market leaders. The acquisition is seen as part of a broader portfolio-strengthening strategy by major players like Pfizer, Roche, and Eli Lilly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Aggressive Squirrel Attacks Multiple Residents in Northern California Neighborhood</h2>

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel is causing alarm in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael, California, after attacking several people and sending at least two to the emergency room with bites and scratches. Residents have posted warning fliers about the "very mean squirrel" that reportedly "comes out of nowhere" to attack. A local humane society expert suggests the squirrel's behavior is likely the result of being hand-fed by humans, which causes wild animals to lose their natural fear and become aggressive when they don't receive expected food. Officials advise the public to never feed wildlife, as it puts both animals and people at risk.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former senior economic official in China, Yang Weimin, has urged the government to prioritize increasing household income in its next five-year plan. He argued that weak consumer demand, which is a fundamental drag on the economy, is primarily caused by insufficient income growth. Speaking ahead of a key Communist Party meeting, Yang emphasized the need to raise the share of household disposable income within the national total to power future growth through consumption. His comments suggest a potential policy shift towards strengthening the consumer sector as China formulates its economic strategy for the coming years, focusing on sustainable domestic demand rather than relying solely on investment and exports.

          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a 14% increase in membership fee income and a 13.5% rise in e-commerce sales. The warehouse club has successfully attracted more members, particularly younger shoppers, as consumers continue to seek value. The company noted it has been working to offset the impact of tariffs by introducing private-label alternatives and shifting its merchandise assortment. Despite decelerating same-store sales growth, overall traffic to its stores and website increased globally. The results indicate Costco's business model remains robust in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After being viewed as a prime takeover target earlier in the year, British energy giant BP has seen its position strengthen significantly, quieting acquisition rumors. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since April, outperforming rivals, due to a strategic reset, leadership changes, and recent successful oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized a focus on growth to drive shareholder value. Analysts note that improved quarterly results and the appointment of a new chairman with a history of successful turnarounds have boosted investor confidence, making a takeover less likely and marking a notable turnaround from its previous embattled state.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law providing immediate mortgage relief for victims of the January 7 fire storms. The legislation, Assembly Bill 238, allows affected homeowners to pause their mortgage payments for up to one year without penalties or negative impacts on their credit scores. To qualify, borrowers only need to attest that the fires caused a financial hardship. This law offers more substantial support than a previous voluntary program, aiming to ease the financial burden on families who are simultaneously paying for temporary housing while trying to rebuild their damaged or destroyed homes.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa's manager, Unai Emery, has publicly backed striker Ollie Watkins to overcome his current goal-scoring drought. The England international has now gone 10 games without a goal for his club and country, recently having a penalty saved during a Europa League match against Bologna. Despite the miss, fans at the Holte End chanted his name in support. Emery praised Watkins' work rate and contribution to the team, stating that his effort was "fantastic" and that the goals will eventually come as a result of his hard work. Watkins' form has been a concern, as he has missed all five of his big chances this season.</p>
