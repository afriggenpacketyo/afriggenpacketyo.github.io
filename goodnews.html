This successful final mission concludes the H2A series' career, which had a 98% success rate despite an early failure in 2003.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of astronomers has discovered mysterious, ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been detected so far back in the universe's history. This finding, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, suggests that processes like supermassive black hole activity were shaping galaxies much earlier than previously thought. The discovery opens a new window into understanding the evolution of the early universe.</p>

Although his workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, his dominant display of high-velocity fastballs and sharp breaking pitches was a major positive. The Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, and the offense couldn't overcome an early deficit.</p>

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the gap in chip production is a major challenge for Chinese firms. However, he highlighted that companies like DeepSeek are achieving results comparable to top US competitors using far less computing power, demonstrating a strong focus on algorithmic breakthroughs. This suggests China is pursuing a different strategic path in the intense global AI race.</p>

Researchers analyzed the DNA of more than 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses. The findings revealed that while family members were buried together, genetic connections were primarily through the female line, indicating a matrilineal system where husbands likely moved into their wife's household. This is further supported by evidence of preferential treatment, with females receiving five times more grave goods than males.</p>
