          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with two chordomas, rare malignant tumors, one on her brain stem and another on her spine. Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan after an MRI revealed the spinal tumor. The spinal tumor's location made traditional approaches impossible, so Dr. Labib pioneered a "third nostril" approach, accessing the tumor through Flores' eye socket. The successful 20-hour procedure involved removing part of her cheekbone and using a titanium plate to rebuild her eye socket, with Flores now cancer-free after radiation and rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Mirra Andreeva thanked a fan for gifting her a "lucky charm" before her French Open third-round victory against Yulia Putintseva. The Russian tennis player had a small fabric patch with floral patterns on her bench during the match. Andreeva, who lost to Jasmine Paolini in last year's semi-finals, is one of the in-form players in Paris. She has claimed titles at Indian Wells and the Dubai Tennis Championships earlier this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are adopting a more frugal approach to summer vacations due to economic uncertainties. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have decreased. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, staying with family, and driving instead of flying to save money. Despite slightly lower travel costs, inflation has reduced disposable income, leading to more budget-conscious vacation planning.</p>
