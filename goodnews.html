          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for months as the Trump administration sought his deportation for alleged anti-Israel activities. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, and his detention appeared to be a punishment for his political speech. Khalil's arrest sparked protests and discussions about free speech, with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release pending immigration proceedings. Khalil had been detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, criticizing the detention as "highly unusual." Khalil's wife expressed relief, while the White House stated they would appeal the decision. Khalil was initially detained based on a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but Judge Farbiarz ruled this insufficient for continued detention.</p>

The individuals were apprehended in Ciudad Ju√°rez after security agents identified them traveling in a vehicle. The arrests are intended to help curb drug trafficking and prevent drugs from reaching young people, a priority for Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>

The team will partner with organizations like the California Community Foundation and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor to provide aid to immigrant families. The Dodgers' announcement follows criticism and calls for the team to take a stand against federal immigration policies, given their large Latino fan base. The team previously asked federal agents to leave stadium grounds after they gathered near one of the entrances.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski made MLB history after pitching a near-perfect game in his second MLB start. Misiorowski had a no-hitter through six innings before allowing a home run in the seventh. He became the first starting pitcher in the modern era to begin his career with 11 consecutive no-hit innings. The 23-year-old right-hander struck out six and threw a fastball topping out at 102.1 mph. He is the only big leaguer since 1900 to have more wins than hits allowed in his first two career starts.</p>

          <p>Ashley Kaye, a 36-year-old, sold her childhood home to travel the world in a Toyota Tacoma truck. She was inspired to leave her corporate healthcare job and travel full-time after meeting someone on a scuba diving trip. Kaye has since visited over 20 countries, including Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. She estimates she has spent over $50,000 on renovations to the truck, including purchasing a camper and adding solar power.

          <p>French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, dubbed "Gwada negative." The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient undergoing routine tests before surgery. The woman is the only known carrier of the new blood type. Scientists were able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to "high-throughput DNA sequencing," which highlighted a genetic mutation.</p>
