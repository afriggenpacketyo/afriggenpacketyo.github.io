        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a downturn on Friday, attributed to a decline in the company's profits, which were impacted by the significant decrease in oil prices throughout the year. The company's net income saw a reduction of over 30%, falling to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion in the previous year. Despite these challenges, Chevron intends to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, although this is less than the $3.9 billion repurchased in the first quarter. The company's U.S. production business also saw a profit decline of more than 10% due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., and other Japanese carmakers reported a combined 11.8 percent increase in U.S. sales for April, totaling 464,372 vehicles, as reported in a Kyodo News digest. This surge in sales is attributed to increased buying activity in anticipation of price increases due to a recently implemented 25 percent tariff on cars produced outside the United States. The Kyodo News digest also noted that over 90 nations, including Japan, advocated for preserving memories of the devastation caused by nuclear attacks during a U.N. meeting, marking the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.</p>

          <p>Zhao Xintong delivered an outstanding performance, establishing a commanding 12-4 lead against Ronnie O'Sullivan, a seven-time champion, in their World Championship semi-final match at the Crucible. Zhao secured all eight frames during Friday morning's session, becoming only the fourth player to achieve an 8-0 session win against O'Sullivan at this venue. O'Sullivan, who has openly discussed issues with his cue, made changes after the opening session but struggled to capitalize, missing several key shots. Zhao, competing as an amateur, displayed precision and compiled breaks of 112 and 115, suggesting he is ready to become the first Chinese player to win the title in Sheffield.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced a joint economic investment deal granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities against Russia. This agreement is particularly significant for the American economy amidst its escalating trade war with China, a major producer of rare earth and critical minerals. The deal encompasses a variety of resources, including rare earth elements, oil, and natural gas, with the U.S. providing financial or military assistance and Ukraine contributing half of any royalties from future licenses. Experts suggest Ukraine's existing workforce and metallurgical expertise could provide a more readily available source of these strategically vital natural resources compared to other potential sources like Greenland.</p>

          <p>Essex bowler Sam Cook is poised to make his debut for England after being named in the squad for the upcoming Test match against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. The 27-year-old seamer, who has consistently excelled in domestic cricket, has been given an opportunity due to injuries affecting several key players, including Chris Woakes and Mark Wood. This means England will start a significant year of Test cricket with a relatively inexperienced pace attack. Along with Cook, Nottinghamshire seamer Josh Tongue is also returning to the squad after nearly two years since his last appearance.</p>

The regulator ordered TikTok to comply with data processing rules within six months, potentially suspending transfers to China if compliance isn't met.

The lynx has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. A shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.</p>
