          <p>AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave has announced its intention to acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is a strategic move for CoreWeave, significantly expanding its control over critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of data center capacity, as it competes in the AI sector. For Core Scientific, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, the acquisition represents a major pivot towards high-performance computing. The move will reportedly eliminate $10 billion in future lease obligations for CoreWeave, enhancing its operational efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built an innovative printer capable of adding braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The device was created for the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM) to accommodate materials that commercial braille printers cannot handle. The student-designed machine features open hardware, making it accessible for BISM's low-vision employees to operate. This invention will streamline the process of labeling products for an annual fundraiser that supports individuals with vision loss, replacing a laborious manual process.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old from Boulder, has fulfilled a lifelong dream of seeing penguins, 70 years after she was denied the opportunity. In the 1950s, Garcia was set to join a research trip to Antarctica but was barred from going at the last minute simply because she was a woman. Compassionate Hospice and the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance collaborated to arrange a special behind-the-scenes visit for Garcia to meet the zoo's African penguins. The event provided a joyful resolution to a story of past discrimination, creating an unforgettable day for Garcia and her family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix continues to successfully lure elite Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig, despite largely forgoing traditional wide theatrical releases. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering an appealing combination of substantial financial backing, significant creative freedom, and access to a global subscriber base of over 300 million. This strategy has made Netflix a haven for auteur-driven projects that traditional studios might consider too expensive or commercially risky. By doing so, Netflix secures prestigious, award-contending content while avoiding the high marketing costs and financial risks of the conventional box office model.</p>

Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change, which would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, has been praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass as a huge step forward in recognizing such a loss as a true bereavement rather than an illness. This move aims to provide parents with the necessary time to grieve without workplace pressure.</p>

This decision allows Taiwan to join the commemoration for the 80th anniversary of the 1945 bombings.
