        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New England seafood industry is exploring the consumption of green crabs as a strategy to combat the invasive species' detrimental effects on the shellfish industry and ecosystem. Green crabs, originating from Europe and West Africa, consume a variety of species, including soft-shell clams. While the crabs offer little meat, some companies are finding innovative ways to utilize them, such as creating crab broth powder. This initiative aims to create a market for green crabs and encourage eradication programs to protect shellfish populations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies due to widespread availability of vaccines for pregnant individuals and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants. Hospitalizations for babies under seven months decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children admitted for RSV often require less intensive care. These findings suggest that preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe RSV illness.</p>

          <p>Maintaining friendships requires effort and consistent upkeep, similar to maintaining a shared home. Strategies for sustaining friendships include making the first move, as emphasized by Fred Gregory, a retired Army medic, who encourages men to swallow their pride and initiate contact. Consistency is also crucial, with some groups meeting regularly for meals or utilizing pre-booking strategies to ensure future meetups. Generational differences in communication styles can be bridged by finding shared activities, such as playing word games or engaging in community activism, to foster connection across age groups.</p>

Volumes II and III were transferred from the National Museum of Asian Art, while efforts are underway to repatriate Volume I, which remains in private ownership.
