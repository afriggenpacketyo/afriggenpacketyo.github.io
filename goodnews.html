          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of the State Supreme Court race, rejecting Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin's efforts to invalidate thousands of votes. Judge Richard E. Myers II ruled that discarding the challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of the voters. The ruling favors Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes after two recounts. Griffin has seven days to appeal the decision, which election experts warn could set a precedent for future election challenges.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a prominent website for deepfake pornography, has shut down after its service provider withdrew support. The site allowed users to upload and view AI-generated deepfake porn, including nonconsensual content. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery. Experts see this as a positive step in combating deepfake abuse, although the issue of nonconsensual imagery remains.</p>
