          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 07:21:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners seeking to restrict public access. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to open-air recreation. Judges stated that this right naturally includes camping. The decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England. Dartmoor National Park covers a 368-square-mile area and is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights on private land in England.</p>

          <p>New episodes of Gary Lineker's podcast, 'The Rest is Football,' will no longer be available on BBC Sounds after Lineker's departure from the corporation following an antisemitism row. The show, produced by Lineker's company, will continue to be available elsewhere. Lineker had already been due to leave Match of the Day and will not front the BBC's FA Cup and World Cup coverage next year after being criticized for sharing a post about Zionism bearing the image of a rat. He has apologized, stating he did not see the image and would never consciously repost anything antisemitic.</p>

          <p>In Pakistan, a team of doctors and vets is treating two elephants, Madhubala and Malika, for tuberculosis by administering at least 400 pills each day. The medication, identical to that used for human TB treatment, is hidden inside various foods. The elephants initially resisted, but have gradually adapted to the procedure. The team of four handlers wear protective gear to avoid contracting the disease. The Karachi Safari Park hopes the year-long treatment plan will help the elephants overcome the illness.</p>

          <p>UK health officials have reported the first detection of West Nile virus in mosquitoes in the UK. Fragments of the virus were found in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes. While there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date, the virus is endemic in several regions across the world. The UK Health Security Agency said that the risk to the general public is 'very low'. Experts recommend getting rid of standing water sources and using mosquito repellent to avoid mosquito bites.</p>

          <p>A Vietnamese court has sentenced 23 officials and business people to prison for illegally exploiting and exporting rare earth minerals. The case involved the unlawful granting of a mining license to Thai Duong Company for rare earth exploitation in Yen Bai province. The defendants sold rare earths and iron ore from the mine for nearly $30 million, with much of it going to China. The U.S. Geological Survey recently revised down its estimate of Vietnam's rare earth reserves, impacting the country's ambitions to compete with Beijing in the high-tech sector.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after public outcry over his comment about never having to buy rice because he receives it as gifts, which struck a nerve amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. Japan has been grappling with rising rice prices due to weather and policies protecting local farmers. Voters are increasingly discontent with the government's failure to address rice prices and rejection of consumption tax cuts amid rising inflation.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned Wednesday after facing a backlash over a remark that struck a nerve with the public suffering from soaring rice prices, dealing a blow to the already unpopular Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of a parliamentary election. Ishiba, who ultimately bowed to opposition pressure and sacked Eto, picked Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, as the new agriculture minister, installing the popular former environment minister who lost in the Liberal Democratic Party's presidential race last year. This highlights the political sensitivity of rising food prices in Japan.</p>

Lowe's expects full-year sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion.
