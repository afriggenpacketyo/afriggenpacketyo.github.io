          <p>Coco Gauff, the world No. 3, demonstrated remarkable resilience as she fought through tears and significant serving challenges to defeat Donna Vekić 7-6 (5), 6-2, securing her place in the US Open third round. The match was an emotional ordeal, publicly revealing her struggle with a recently remade serve, which led to seven double faults in the first set. Gauff managed to reset during a medical timeout, practicing her serve and drawing inspiration from the presence of Simone Biles in the stands. This hard-fought victory, despite ongoing technical adjustments, underscores her burgeoning mental toughness and ability to perform under immense pressure in a major championship.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets presented a mixed picture on Friday, diverging from Wall Street's performance as investors carefully assessed a range of regional economic data and significant political developments. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix experienced slight declines after Tokyo's core consumer prices showed a slower increase in August, though still exceeding the Bank of Japan's 2% target. South Korea's Kospi also registered a loss following reports of former First Lady Kim Keon Hee's indictment on corruption charges, which contributed to a weakening of the South Korean won. Additionally, the article highlights the upcoming meeting between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, indicating potential bilateral discussions.</p>

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet China's President Xi Jinping at the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, marking Modi's first visit to China in seven years. This high-level meeting signals a potential for improved ties between the two Asian giants, despite deeply entrenched historical suspicions, the lingering impact of the deadly Galwan Valley clashes in 2020, and India's persistent, widening trade deficit with China. While experts remain cautious about the prospect of a long-lasting friendship, the visit could indicate a pragmatic willingness from both sides to find common ground, especially as they each confront tariff pressures from the U.S. and navigate complex economic interdependencies in a shifting global landscape.</p>

          <p>Luo Weiwei, a distinguished former NASA scientist, has become a pivotal figure in China's semiconductor industry through her innovative company, Innoscience. Established in 2015, Innoscience focuses on gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a material recognized for its potential to revolutionize efficiency in power electronics. In a remarkably short span of less than six years, Luo's company achieved a global first by successfully mass-producing 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, thereby significantly advancing industry standards. This technological breakthrough not only positions China prominently at the forefront of third-generation semiconductor technology but also underscores its strategic advancements amidst the ongoing efforts by the United States to decouple from China in cutting-edge chip technology.</p>

          <p>Scientists are embarking on a crucial study of the DNA of ancient English oaks, exemplified by the magnificent 800-year-old Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire, to uncover the genetic secrets behind their extraordinary resilience to environmental challenges. Researchers from The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association are seeking to understand how these venerable trees can survive for a millennium or more, resisting threats such as climate change and recovering from diseases. This vital knowledge will inform efforts to select and plant the most robust oak trees in the future, aiming to restore Britain's depleted woodlands and consequently revitalize the diverse wildlife, as oaks support more species than any other native tree.</p>

          <p>Venus Williams achieved a significant milestone by securing her first US Open women’s doubles win since 2014, partnering with Leylah Fernandez to triumph over the sixth-seeded pair of Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez. Despite Williams' humble assertion that she is not a strong doubles player, the 45-year-old veteran demonstrated her enduring determination and found a powerful, equally determined partner in Fernandez, whom she affectionately compared to her legendary sister, Serena. The duo, enthusiastically cheered by a nearly full Louis Armstrong Stadium, impressively overcame a 5-2 deficit in the first set tiebreaker to claim the victory. This win marks a positive and spirited return to doubles for Williams after a 16-month hiatus from the tour.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beginning January 2026, all young children across England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the National Health Service (NHS), administered as two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, in conjunction with the existing MMR jab. This significant and long-awaited rollout aims to provide crucial protection to youngsters from the severe, though rare, complications associated with the varicella virus, while also potentially saving families an estimated £24 million annually in lost income and productivity. Health officials anticipate that this vaccination program will dramatically reduce the overall number of chickenpox cases. A catch-up campaign is also planned for slightly older children to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>
