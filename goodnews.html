          <p>House Republicans are set to vote on a comprehensive bill aiming to advance President Trump's domestic agenda. The legislation includes extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, increasing the child tax credit, and raising the standard deduction. It also addresses the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, Medicaid work requirements, and reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The bill proposes raising the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion, a measure necessary to prevent a potential government default. </p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, driven by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America analysts suggest emerging markets are 'the next bull market,' citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen 8.55% year-to-date, contrasting with the S&P 500's 1% increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are pressing the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, over their baggage fees. These groups accuse the airlines of 'misleading' passengers and causing 'confusion' with additional charges for hand baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines. They argue that these practices breach EU consumer law, with passengers potentially paying up to ‚Ç¨280 extra. The consumer groups are seeking an investigation and sanctions, advocating for a standard luggage allowance within the ticket price. </p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concern about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, reiterating that using tariffs to address trade imbalances is inappropriate. Japan is considering backing off from seeking a full removal of U.S. tariffs on cars and auto parts. </p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have surged, with some areas 4C warmer than normal, creating a marine heatwave. April and May saw the highest sea temperatures in 45 years of monitoring. Climate change is causing oceans to warm globally, making such heatwaves more likely. The heatwave is most intense off the west coast of Ireland and parts of Cornwall and Devon. Scientists are monitoring the impact on marine life, with potential disruptions to breeding patterns and influxes of jellyfish. </p>
