          <p>A video circulating on social media, purportedly showing Donald Trump announcing a new healthcare era featuring miraculous "MedBeds," has been identified as a fake created with artificial intelligence. The video, which mimics a Fox News segment, claims every American will receive a MedBed card for access to advanced hospitals. However, fact-checkers point to several AI-telltale signs, such as mismatched mouth movements and visual inconsistencies in the background. The MedBed myth, originating in far-right online communities, falsely claims the existence of technology that can cure any disease, a fantasy experts say preys on the desperation of those with chronic illnesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Taylor Swift releases her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," fans purchasing vinyl records will not face higher prices from recent tariff changes due to a Cold War-era law. The Berman Amendment exempts "informational materials" like physical music from presidential trade regulations, shielding the booming vinyl market from tariffs imposed on other low-cost imports. This exemption is a relief to the music industry and consumers, as vinyl sales now constitute nearly three-quarters of physical music revenue. However, some U.S.-based record manufacturers argue that tariffs would support domestic production and create more American jobs.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has urged retail investors to ignore a recent downgrade of Apple stock by a Jefferies analyst, reaffirming his long-held advice to "own it, don't trade it." While acknowledging the analyst's successful track record in timing short-term trades, Cramer argued that such frequent buying and selling is detrimental for individual investors. The Jefferies note suggested that positive demand for the iPhone 17 is already priced in and that expectations for a future foldable model are overly optimistic. Cramer countered by highlighting strong early demand and Apple's history of successfully entering existing markets with superior products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of several quantum computing companies, including Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, saw double-digit gains this week, driven by a series of positive developments in the sector. Rigetti announced $5.7 million in new purchase orders, while a major Danish investment in a quantum venture fund and a supportive blog post from Nvidia further boosted investor confidence. This surge reflects a broader trend of increased investment in quantum technology from tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon. While proponents believe quantum computing can solve highly complex problems, some experts caution that a true market breakout for the technology is still several years away.

          <p>Phil Rosenthal, creator of "Everybody Loves Raymond" and host of the Netflix series "Somebody Feed Phil," is opening a new restaurant in Los Angeles named Max and Helen's, in tribute to his late parents. The diner aims to be a community hub, serving comfort food classics like fluffy scrambled eggs, which were his father's favorite dish. Rosenthal's parents were beloved figures on his travel show, and their memory is central to the new venture, which he hopes will counteract the disappearance of local diners across America. He has enlisted acclaimed chef Nancy Silverton to help create the menu for the neighborhood spot.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team delivered a commanding 10-wicket victory over South Africa in their World Cup opener, making a strong statement after a period of criticism. The win was set up by a remarkable performance from left-arm spinner Linsey Smith, who dismantled South Africa's powerful top three batters. This emphatic result serves as a much-needed morale boost for the team, which has faced scrutiny since an early exit from last year's T20 World Cup and a poor Ashes series. The performance suggests a significant turnaround under new captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to within 1% of its all-time high as the U.S. government shutdown continued into its third day, reinforcing its growing status as a safe-haven asset. The cryptocurrency climbed approximately 12% this week, with analysts suggesting that investors are turning to the decentralized asset amid rising concerns over U.S. government instability. Unlike previous shutdowns, Bitcoin's market position is now more established, causing it to trade in correlation with perceived risks in the U.S. government. Some analysts predict the cryptocurrency could soon set a new record high and potentially reach $135,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri led the field in Friday practice for the Singapore Grand Prix, outpacing his teammate Lando Norris, who finished fifth after a difficult day. Norris's session was complicated by a pit lane collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who was unsafely released into his path, breaking the McLaren's front wing. The session was also interrupted by two separate crashes involving George Russell and Liam Lawson, which brought out red flags. Despite the disruptions, Red Bull's Max Verstappen reported a positive day, finishing third fastest as teams worked to optimize their setups for the demanding street circuit.</p>

          <h2>Key Steps to Take Before Settling a Debt with a Collection Agency</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before paying a debt collector, it is crucial to take several protective steps rather than immediately complying with their demands. First, consumers should verify the debt is valid by requesting a written validation notice, which collectors are legally required to provide. It is also important to weigh all options, such as negotiating a lower lump-sum settlement or a payment plan, and to understand the statute of limitations for the debt in your state. Finally, any agreement must be obtained in writing before sending money, ensuring the terms are clear and the payment will fully satisfy the debt.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Why Government Shutdowns are a Uniquely American Political Phenomenon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 12:23:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike most other Western democracies, the United States experiences frequent government shutdowns due to its unique political structure. In parliamentary systems like the United Kingdom's, the executive branch that proposes the budget typically commands a legislative majority, and a failure to pass a budget can trigger new elections, raising the political stakes. In contrast, the U.S. system separates executive and legislative powers, grants Congress significant control over spending, and has a high procedural bar for passing legislation in the Senate. These factors create more opportunities for deadlock and make shutdowns a recurring feature of American politics.</p>
