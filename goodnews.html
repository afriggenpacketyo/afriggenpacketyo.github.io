          <h2>Egg Prices Drop to Five-Month Low Due to Avian Flu Abatement and Seasonal Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 18:05:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are seeing relief as egg prices fell to $4.55 per dozen in May, an 11% decrease from April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This drop is attributed to the receding effects of the widespread avian flu outbreak and a seasonal softening in egg demand as consumers shift to more meat and outdoor grilling during the summer months. While prices have decreased for two consecutive months, they remain higher than the previous year, with experts cautioning that the avian flu outbreak is not entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, as evidenced by a May outbreak at an Arizona layer farm affecting nearly 1.4 million birds. Consumer Price Index data shows that overall food costs rose slightly in May, but egg prices dropped, though they are still substantially higher than they were 12 months ago. The recent price drop provides some relief for consumers, but the industry remains vigilant about the ongoing threat of avian flu.</p>

          <p>The Army is reverting to earlier names for seven installations previously named after Confederate heroes, now honoring a Black hero instead of Robert E. Lee. This decision marks a significant shift in the Trump administration's approach to military base names, reflecting a broader effort to recognize diverse figures in American history. The change is part of a larger initiative to address historical injustices and promote inclusivity within the armed forces. The move signifies a step towards acknowledging and celebrating the contributions of individuals from all backgrounds in the nation's military history.</p>

The author argues that NATO does not hold the answer, and China's potential mediation could be crucial in addressing the thorniest issues and achieving a lasting peace.</p>

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed the deal strengthens UK-Spain relations.

          <p>President Trump stated that Chinese students are welcome in U.S. colleges and universities, potentially reversing a previous policy to "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students. This statement follows Secretary of State Marco Rubio's suggestion that the U.S. would broadly revoke Chinese student visas and target individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Universities depend on tuition fees from international students and see Chinese students as integral to their academic operations. Trump's new position has exacerbated uncertainty at universities, which have faced various actions under his administration, including grant cancellations and investigations into admissions policies.</p>

The U.S. is working toward deals with its 18 "important trading partners," and Bessent suggested that the tariff pause could be extended for those countries and trading blocs, such as the European Union, that are negotiating in good faith.
