          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport due to radar outages and air traffic controller shortages, according to this article from The Guardian. The reductions, set to last for several weeks, aim to ensure flight reliability and minimize delays, particularly during peak international arrival times. The Trump administration is also proposing a multi-billion-dollar overhaul of the air traffic control system, including new centers and technology upgrades, while considering raising the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers to address staffing shortages. Despite the challenges, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby assures the public that flying in and out of Newark remains safe due to backup procedures and training.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that over half of business leaders who laid off employees in anticipation of AI replacing their jobs now regret the decision, according to this article from The Guardian. The article argues that AI is not yet capable of replacing human workers, particularly in small and mid-sized companies, and while AI platforms offer enhanced search capabilities, they are not reliable enough to handle core business operations without human oversight. The author emphasizes that building AI systems is expensive and requires businesses to relinquish data to tech giants, and the article advises businesses to wait for AI technology to mature before making drastic workforce changes.</p>
