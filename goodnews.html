          <p>Following claims of heavy metal pollution in northern Thai rivers linked to mining in Myanmar, the Chinese embassy in Thailand stated it is closely monitoring the situation. The embassy acknowledged comments by the Thai government and said it is willing to work with Mekong basin countries to protect the ecology and water quality. The embassy emphasized that Chinese companies overseas are required to abide by host countries' laws and regulations. Last week, Thailand's Pollution Control Department reported unsafe levels of heavy metals in sediment samples from rivers in northern Thailand, attributing the contamination to upstream mining operations. The lead levels were particularly high in the Sai and Kok rivers near the Thai-Myanmar border. The article did not reflect any financial advice. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>Chicago is implementing various strategies to resist President Trump's mass deportation agenda, rooted in collaboration between organizations that have been in place since his first administration. The city's efforts include "Know Your Rights" campaigns, community meetings, and rapid-response groups to monitor ICE activity. Volunteer interest in anti-deportation efforts has increased significantly, and Chicago has remained a "pro-immigrant" city with policies protecting immigrants. However, challenges remain as ICE arrests people at record levels, and conservative city council members have attempted to change Chicago‚Äôs sanctuary city status.

          <p>The Florida Board of Governors rejected Santa Ono, the sole nominee to lead the University of Florida, due to his past support for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. Ono, the former University of Michigan president, had promised to implement "DEI 2.0" and described racism as "one of America‚Äôs original sins." The Florida Board of Governors questioned Ono's lack of response to anti-Israel protests at the University of Michigan, and his recency in changing his stance on DEI initiatives raised concerns.

          <p>Theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek discusses the implications of using ideas from fundamental physics to describe physics inside materials, and vice versa. The fact that physics inside materials can be described using the same ideas we use to describe fundamental physics in empty space has been amazingly fruitful. It has made modern electronics and computer technology possible, and continues to inspire big innovations in technology and discoveries in fundamental physics.

Mark Brown, president of Tuskegee University, discusses how Black universities can navigate the uncertainty of this administration by emphasizing their role as merit-based schools and economic engines.

In terms of weight, 5,864.6 tonnes of rare earth elements were shipped from China in May ‚Äì a year-on-year decline of 5.67 per cent.
