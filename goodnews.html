        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of its victory against Japanese aggression during World War II is about remembering historical truth, not inciting hatred against modern Japan. The author contends that it is possible to condemn the brutality of the wartime military while simultaneously appreciating contemporary Japanese culture, citing their own childhood filled with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime. The piece suggests that these historical remembrances serve as a necessary reflection on the sacrifices made for peace. It pushes back against critics who view these commemorations as a tool for cultivating ongoing hostility between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged Ethan Foltz, a 22-year-old from Oregon, with developing and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." The botnet allegedly infected tens of thousands of devices like routers and DVRs, which were then used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for paying customers. These attacks targeted websites and servers in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network. Prosecutors described the botnet as one of the most sophisticated of its kind, and law enforcement was able to shut it down after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose after the company maintained its full-year sales forecast, signaling confidence despite slightly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The home improvement giant expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the year, even as it navigates a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty. The company noted encouraging signs, including a rise in big-ticket transactions and sales growth in most merchandising departments. While the sluggish housing market and high borrowing costs remain challenges, Home Depot is expanding its focus on professional contractors through strategic acquisitions like SRS Distribution.

This move follows an agreement where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China in exchange for permission to sell certain chips in the region. The Trump administration had previously halted the sale of advanced AI chips to China over national security concerns. Nvidia confirmed it is evaluating various products to remain competitive within the bounds set by government regulations, emphasizing that all offerings are designed for commercial use.
