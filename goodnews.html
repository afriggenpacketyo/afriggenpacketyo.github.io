          <p>The second episode of 'Celebrity Traitors' was marked by suspicion and awkward attempts at deception, with Olympic diver Tom Daley openly distrusting presenter Kate Garraway. Daley's conspicuous side-eye and eye-roll reactions to Garraway's behavior became a major talking point, as many contestants and viewers accused her of "over-acting" to hide her potential role as a Traitor. Meanwhile, comedian Alan Carr, revealed as a Traitor in the first episode, struggled to maintain his composure after committing his first "murder." The article notes that the high-stakes nature of the game, centered on betrayal and manipulation, appears to be rattling the nerves of its celebrity participants.</p>

          <p>The United States is deploying approximately 200 troops to Israel to help monitor the recent ceasefire agreement and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. U.S. officials stated that a new “civil-military coordination center” will be established in Israel, staffed by personnel with expertise in logistics, security, and engineering. These troops will not enter Gaza but will play a crucial role in overseeing the implementation of the peace deal and supporting the transition to a civilian government. The deployment marks a significant U.S. military role in the post-conflict phase, addressing the logistical and security challenges of the peace plan's initial stages.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel expressed his disappointment with the lack of energy from the home crowd at Wembley Stadium during his team's 3-0 friendly win against Wales. Despite England scoring three goals in the first 20 minutes, Tuchel noted that the stadium was "silent" and that for long periods, only the Welsh fans could be heard. He argued that the team's dominant performance warranted more enthusiastic support and felt the atmosphere did not match the quality displayed on the field. The comments have sparked a debate among fans and pundits about the atmosphere at England's home games and whether the criticism was justified for a non-competitive match.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant breakthrough in Middle East peace negotiations, confirming that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of his administration's plan. Speaking from the White House, Trump stated that all remaining Israeli hostages are expected to be released early next week and that he plans to travel to the region for a formal signing ceremony. While celebrating the agreement as a step toward "everlasting peace," key details about subsequent phases, such as Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza, remain unclear. The deal follows months of intense negotiations and has been presented as a major diplomatic achievement for the administration.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has halted the execution of Robert Roberson, who was scheduled to die for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. Roberson's defense has long maintained his innocence, arguing that his conviction was based on a flawed "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis, a theory that has faced increasing scientific scrutiny. His legal team presented new expert testimony suggesting the child died from severe pneumonia, not abuse. The court has ordered a review of the case under Texas's "junk science" law, which allows convictions to be challenged if the scientific evidence used is no longer considered credible, providing Roberson a new chance to prove his innocence.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, the election technology company that became the focus of widespread false claims following the 2020 election, has been acquired by a new company called Liberty Vote. The acquiring entity announced it has assumed full ownership and operational control, with Dominion's website now redirecting to the new company. In its press release, Liberty Vote stated its mission is to "transform and improve election integrity in America" and emphasized leveraging hand-marked paper ballots. The sale marks a new chapter for a company that was at the center of numerous defamation lawsuits, including a landmark settlement with Fox News, over baseless election fraud allegations.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent sales slowdown for major players like BYD, China is methodically engineering Asia's emergence as the world's leading electric vehicle (EV) factory through strategic investments and technology transfers. Unlike Western nations imposing protectionist tariffs, Southeast Asian countries are embracing Chinese partnerships, fostering an integrated and resilient supply chain. For example, battery giant CATL is investing $6 billion in Indonesia to build a complete battery ecosystem, leveraging local resources with Chinese expertise. This collaborative approach, focused on joint ventures and interdependence, suggests that Asia's EV future will be defined by regional integration rather than zero-sum competition.

Morgan Rogers opened the scoring, followed by goals from Ollie Watkins and a standout curling shot from Bukayo Saka. Declan Rice, captain for the night, was instrumental in controlling the midfield and dictating the pace of the game. While the second half was less eventful as both teams made numerous substitutions, the match served as a strong display for England under manager Thomas Tuchel and a valuable experience for players returning from injury or making their first starts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's recent Gaza ceasefire agreement was achieved through a unique combination of diplomatic pressure, personal relationships, and strategic timing that eluded his predecessor. A key turning point was an Israeli airstrike in Qatar, which prompted Trump to leverage his close ties with both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Gulf state leaders to demand an end to the conflict. Unlike the previous administration, Trump was able to apply unprecedented direct pressure on Israel while simultaneously securing backing from key Arab nations. This unorthodox approach, combined with a changed geopolitical landscape, ultimately created the conditions necessary to bring both sides to the negotiating table.</p>

Isaacman, the founder of Shift4 and a seasoned private astronaut with close ties to SpaceX, was previously nominated for the position before Trump withdrew the offer, citing Isaacman's political affiliations and friendship with Elon Musk. Tensions between Trump and Musk have since eased, and the recent meetings suggest a renewed interest in Isaacman's vision for the space agency. The development comes as NASA faces significant challenges, including proposed budget cuts and staffing reductions resulting from a government efficiency initiative.</p>

Prosecutors stated there were also indications of a plan to use a drone to carry an explosive payload.

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation. This annual adjustment helps prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income hasn't increased. For 2026, the standard deduction will rise to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. The income thresholds for each of the seven tax rates have also been raised. These changes come as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes many previous tax cuts permanent, potentially providing further relief for some taxpayers.</p>

He advocates for turning away from Hollywood clichés and instead engaging with the city's complex past to foster a genuine sense of place.
