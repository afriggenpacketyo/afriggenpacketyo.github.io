          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly investing $14 billion into Scale AI and recruiting its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to bolster Meta's artificial intelligence capabilities. Zuckerberg is frustrated with Meta's current standing in AI and aims to leverage Wang's expertise to improve the company's Llama AI models. By taking a stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta avoids further antitrust scrutiny. Wang will lead a new AI research lab at Meta, bringing some of his colleagues with him, and will help Meta gain collective intelligence on how to build a better ChatGPT.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has affirmed its autonomy following President Trump's announcement that he fired the head of the National Portrait Gallery, Kim Sajet, citing her partisanship. The institution emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary, with oversight from the Board of Regents. The statement comes after Trump signed an executive order placing Vice President JD Vance in charge of supervising efforts to remove "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian. The museum also addressed concerns about biased content and staff, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service (NPS) is implementing a directive to post signage at all sites, encouraging visitors to provide feedback on information they perceive as negatively portraying American history or landscapes. This initiative stems from President Trump's "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History" executive order, which seeks to remove content that "inappropriately disparages Americans past or living." The signs will ask visitors to identify content that fails to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.

          <p>As China imposes rare earth export restrictions, the US and Brazil are accelerating efforts to establish independent supply chains for critical minerals. This move is aimed at reducing reliance on China, which dominates the rare earth market, and ensuring access to essential materials for industries like automotive, electronics, and defense. Companies in the US are investing in separation technology and magnet-making plants to meet the growing demand for rare earth components. The discussions between US and Chinese officials in London this week are expected to focus on bilateral export-control issues, with rare earths being a key topic.</p>

The article argues that peaceful protests can be effective in changing policy and public opinion, citing historical examples of Trump reversing policies due to public opposition.
