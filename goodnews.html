          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living British recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War Two, has passed away at the age of 105. The former Royal Air Force flight lieutenant was awarded the nation's highest military honor for his bravery during a 1944 mission where he piloted a Catalina flying boat to sink a German U-boat despite sustaining 72 severe injuries. After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions as his duty. His passing marks the end of an era for the 181 individuals who received the Victoria Cross during the conflict.</p>

          <p>During his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump concerning the plight of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia during the war. The contents of the letter were not fully disclosed, but it is said to address the thousands of children forcibly transferred from occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia, an act the International Criminal Court has classified as a war crime. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the First Lady for her efforts, highlighting the issue which has become a significant point of international concern and a focus of U.S. lawmakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes achieved several record closes this week, driven by investor speculation regarding the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. Market optimism was initially fueled by a July consumer price index report that showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, increasing hopes for a rate cut in September. However, momentum slowed after the producer price index indicated a rise in wholesale inflation, creating mixed signals for the economy. Despite the volatility, major tech and financial stocks like Nvidia, Meta, and Goldman Sachs hit all-time highs during the week's trading sessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their three children, are set to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park. This move from their current residence at Adelaide Cottage is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" and a new chapter for the family following a challenging period that included the Princess's cancer diagnosis. The couple reportedly views Forest Lodge as their long-term family home, where they intend to live even after Prince William becomes King. The move is being funded privately, and the family will continue to prioritize a private life without live-in staff, with their children remaining at Lambrook school.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" project utilizes four containers arranged in an 'X' shape to form housing units, with each container divided into five individual, air-conditioned rooms. These structures, which can be constructed in just one week, provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to the growing homelessness crisis. Stark's initiative aims to address the affordable housing shortage by using existing materials, and he is now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors using the same innovative method.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article explores the unconventional leadership of Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old billionaire CEO who founded healthcare software giant Epic Systems in 1979. From a Wisconsin basement, she built the company into a dominant force in electronic health records, now holding data for 325 million patients worldwide, all without taking venture capital or going public. Faulkner has cultivated a unique corporate culture at Epic's fantastical campus and has established a detailed succession plan to ensure the company remains private after she steps down. Despite criticism over software usability and interoperability, her steadfast principles have made Epic the most powerful technology company in U.S. healthcare.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) saw a 13% decrease in July compared to the previous month. While ICE has not provided a reason for the dip, activists in states like Oregon believe their efforts may be contributing to the slowdown of President Trump's promised mass deportations. In Portland, a combination of nightly protests outside the ICE field office and a "rapid-response" legal aid hotline has created obstacles for federal agents. The state's lack of an ICE detention facility and its "sanctuary" law, which limits local law enforcement's cooperation with federal agents, are also cited as significant factors complicating ICE's operations in the region.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. The race was a highly anticipated rematch after Lyles narrowly won Olympic gold over Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Thompson's dominant, gun-to-tape performance solidifies his position as a top contender for the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, while Lyles viewed his second-place finish as a positive step in his preparations.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the intense force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him in a space behind the cascade. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol executed the hoist rescue, and Wardwell was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>Police in Devon and Cornwall, UK, have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate used as a deposit for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. Authorities successfully argued in court that the funds were the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering, obtaining a forfeiture order which Tate and his brother did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously forfeited by the Tate brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on business revenues. The recovered funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs within the local community.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping to ease the transition to college for youth coming from the foster care system by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of what they need to furnish a bare dorm room. The organization hosts an annual event where students can select bedding, towels, and other necessities, helping to level the playing field and reduce the feeling of being different from their peers. The initiative not only provides material goods but also connects students with a support network of peers who share similar life experiences.</p>
