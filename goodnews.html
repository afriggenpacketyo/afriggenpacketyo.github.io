          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub since 2021, has announced his departure to pursue a new venture as a founder. His exit comes as GitHub, a key platform for developers, faces intensified competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools. Dohmke will remain until the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition, with GitHub now operating under Microsoft's CoreAI division. The company has seen significant developer growth but is challenged by emerging competitors in the 'vibe coding' space.</p>

          <p>The White House has officially extended the deadline for imposing increased tariffs on Chinese goods by 90 days, preventing them from taking effect. This action was formalized through an executive order signed shortly before the previous pause was set to expire. The extension was an anticipated result following the latest round of trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials held in Stockholm. The delay provides more time for both nations to continue discussions and work towards a potential trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Brady voiced concerns about the current state of college sports, particularly the influence of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals and the transfer portal. He argued that the focus on monetary gain might be overshadowing the development of crucial life values like resilience and competitiveness, which he learned during his challenging time at Michigan. Brady emphasized the role of parents in instilling the right values in young athletes, suggesting that overcoming adversity is more valuable for long-term success than immediate financial reward.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to gold bars from Switzerland and other countries. The initial ruling had caused the precious metal to hit a record high, but prices fell following the president's announcement. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that the tariffs could negatively disrupt the international flow of physical gold. This decision clarifies the administration's stance and stabilizes the market for the commodity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for UFC events in a landmark seven-year, $7.7 billion agreement with TKO Group Holdings. The deal, a significant move under Paramount's new leadership, will bring 13 premium events and 30 fight nights to the Paramount+ streaming service, with select fights also airing on the CBS broadcast network. This arrangement marks a shift away from the pay-per-view model, making all UFC events available to subscribers. The aggressive acquisition signals Paramount's intent to bolster its streaming platform with high-demand live sports content.</p>

Annuities, conversely, provide a guaranteed income stream, offering predictability and security for those nearing or in retirement who prioritize stability over growth potential.
