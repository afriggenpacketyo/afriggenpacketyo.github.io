          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was largely overshadowed by the public feud between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the visit was considered a success for Merz, who addressed key issues such as strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs, and U.S. support for Ukraine. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, highlighting the historical ties between the two nations. The meeting seemingly avoided sensitive topics such as Germany's far-right party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland.</p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes is set to feature a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby: Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza. Journalism, who won the Preakness, is the morning-line favorite for the Belmont, which will be held at Saratoga Race Course due to ongoing renovations at Belmont Park. The race distance has been shortened to 1 1/4 miles, the same length as the Derby. While no horse will win the Triple Crown this year, the Belmont offers a chance for these top contenders to secure another major victory.</p>

The hƒÅlau becomes a source of joy and a community for the author and her family, reminding her of the importance of cultural stewardship and the passing down of traditions across generations.

          <p>Extreme heat is testing the resilience of roads, railways, and bridges, leading to melting roads, buckled rail tracks, and stressed bridges. Experts suggest remedies such as heat-reflective coatings for roads, painting rails white to absorb less heat, and using heat-resistant materials for railway tracks. Bridges can be climate-proofed with expansion joints and regular inspections. Adapting transport infrastructure is vital to maintain economic activity and community connectivity in a warming world.</p>
