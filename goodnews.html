          <p>Michigan Congresswoman Hillary Scholten revealed she was on a suspected killer's target list, along with 45 others, after state police informed her. The suspect is accused of fatally shooting a Minnesota state representative and her husband. Scholten emphasized her commitment to not be intimidated or silenced, characterizing such threats as domestic terrorism. She also criticized Utah Senator Mike Lee for his social media posts about the suspect, calling them offensive and urging bipartisan condemnation of political violence. The lawmaker has faced threats before and is determined to continue serving her constituents despite safety concerns, postponing a town hall meeting while maintaining troopers outside her home around the clock. Optimism remains as Scholten continues to push back against violence.</p>

          <p>Joe Mauer, who was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame last year, discussed the significance of spending his entire 15-season MLB career with the Minnesota Twins. The Minnesota native and former No. 1 overall pick expressed gratitude for the opportunity to play for his hometown team. While he acknowledged that many players desire to stay with one team, circumstances often lead to trades or other changes. Mauer also admitted that winning a World Series championship was the only thing missing from his otherwise perfect career, as he is set to compete in the American Century Championship golf tournament next month.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, a trend that could help address the clean energy transition and reduce a surplus of solar panels. According to Global Energy Monitor, 90 former coal mines in mainland China are now operating as solar-power facilities, with additional projects in the planning stages. These projects offer a chance to combine land restoration, local job creation, and clean energy deployment. Other countries, including Australia, the US, and Greece, are also pursuing similar conversion projects.</p>

Goliath's hatchling was born on June 4 after an incubation period of about four months, marking the first Gal치pagos tortoise hatchling born at the zoo. The zoo has submitted applications to Guinness World Records to recognize Goliath as the oldest first-time father in history. The hatchling is healthy and active in a separate enclosure, as Gal치pagos tortoise parents have no further connection to their offspring after hatching.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with when renewing or applying for a passport. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for self-selection and included an "X" for those who do not identify as either male or female. The ACLU sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it was discriminatory, and the judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers participating in the Democratic mayoral primary will use ranked-choice voting, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If a candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the process continues until two candidates remain. This system has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a specific candidate from winning. The full results will be reported a week after the primary, due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>
