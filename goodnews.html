          <p>Oscar Piastri outperformed his McLaren teammate Lando Norris to secure pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona. Piastri's performance suggests that a recent rule change aimed at limiting front wing flexibility had minimal impact on McLaren's car. Norris admitted to making errors on his final run, preventing him from surpassing Piastri's time. Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull, finished third, with a larger gap between him and the pole-sitter than in previous races this season. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults suggests that parenting should be guided by instinct, culture, and the individual child, rather than complicated advice from influencers or clickbait. Parents should trust their instincts, follow cultural traditions, and pay attention to their child's unique interests. The focus should be on enjoyment and creating a joyful environment rather than obsessing over developmental milestones. The most important thing is for parents to be their real selves, providing love and attention, rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of perfection.</p>
