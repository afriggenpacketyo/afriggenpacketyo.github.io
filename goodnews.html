          <p>The UK Parliament is revisiting the assisted dying bill for England and Wales, incorporating significant changes after its initial passage in November. The updated bill includes amendments such as removing the need for High Court approval for each assisted death request, instead proposing a panel of experts. A recent government impact assessment correction reduced the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year. The debate highlights the division within Parliament, with MPs given a free vote on the matter, and various organizations expressing concerns and support for the proposed legislation.</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated Covid and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting the recommendation to older Americans and those with chronic health issues. The FDA is seeking more clinical data for Novavax's Covid vaccine, and officials are questioning the need for Covid vaccines in children under 12. Experts are divided on the necessity of annual booster shots for younger, healthy individuals, while some fear these changes could undermine the broader vaccine infrastructure. The CDC is also facing scrutiny over its vaccine recommendations, with concerns about political influence.</p>

          <p>Doctors at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia used a custom gene-editing treatment to save a 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency. The treatment, the first of its kind, has the potential to help people with thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. The treatment involved pinpoint targeting of a single mutation in the infant's genome using CRISPR technology. The F.D.A. also expedited regulatory approval of the treatment, and the success is considered a triumph for biomedical research.</p>

          <p>Errol Langton and his family of nine are among the first white South Africans to arrive in the United States after President Trump established refugee status for Afrikaners. The family, who left their hometown due to perceived threats and discrimination, expressed gratitude to President Trump and felt safer in Alabama. The president's decision to prioritize Afrikaners has drawn criticism, but Langton defended it by asserting that every president has prioritized different groups of refugees. The family hopes to eventually purchase a farm in Alabama.</p>
