          <p>The potential $10 billion sale of the Los Angeles Lakers signifies a shift in sports ownership, with teams becoming too valuable for individual billionaires. The team is changing hands from the Buss family to an investment group led by Mark Walter. This trend reflects the increasing involvement of consortiums and institutional investors in sports franchises. The Lakers' new owners are expected to benefit from the team's strong market and loyal fanbase, though the shift raises questions about accountability for teams without such advantages.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the long-held hypothesis that birds sing at dawn due to better sound transmission conditions. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little support for the acoustic transmission hypothesis. Instead, the study suggests that early morning vocal activity relates to birds marking their territory and communicating about food. The findings indicate that environmental factors may not be the primary driver of the dawn chorus, shifting focus to behavioral and social explanations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth elements, offers valuable lessons amid China's export restrictions. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan diversified its rare earth sources, investing in projects like Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. The country's strategy includes stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies. This transformation serves as a reminder of the challenges in escaping China's critical mineral dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
