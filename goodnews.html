          <p>Kris Jenner, the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch, has recently garnered attention for her seemingly rejuvenated appearance, sparking speculation about potential cosmetic procedures, specifically a deep plane facelift. While Jenner's representative confirmed Dr. Steven Levine performed the work, details on the exact procedure remain undisclosed. Experts suggest the results appear both youthful and natural, indicative of a well-executed procedure, potentially involving a fat transfer in addition to a facelift. It is important to discuss medical history, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals with the surgeon before undergoing a facelift, as well as any weight-loss medications being taken. The recovery period for a deep plane facelift can extend up to six months, with risks including infection and nerve damage.</p>

          <p>Prince William celebrated his 43rd birthday with a photo released by Kensington Palace showing him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and her three puppies. The photo, taken by the Princess of Wales in Windsor, was accompanied by a message signed by Catherine and their children, expressing their love. The Royal Family's official account also posted a birthday message with a picture of William visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was gifted to the couple by Catherine's brother after the death of their previous dog, and the puppies were born in May. The picture captures a relaxed moment for the prince amidst recent formal occasions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, especially regarding rare earth minerals, making it better prepared than most for China's export restrictions. Following China's 2010 embargo targeting Tokyo, Japan diversified its rare earth sources, investing heavily in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths has decreased from over 90% to below 60%. While Japan has made strides, it still has a long way to go to cut its dependency on China in some key areas, especially for heavy rare earth elements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle sent by a Scottish schoolgirl in 1994 has been found in Norway, over 30 years later. Alaina Beresford, from Portknockie, sent the message as part of a school project, writing a letter explaining her project on water and asking the finder to write back. The bottle washed up on a Norwegian island and was discovered by Pia Brodtmann, a volunteer cleaning up the beach, who sent Alaina a postcard with details of the find. Alaina, now 42, was surprised and delighted to receive the response after so many years.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the current trend of online feminist criticism towards female celebrities, arguing it has devolved into puritanical tellings-off rather than meaningful analysis. Recent examples include criticism directed at Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae for their perceived transgressions against feminist ideals. The author contrasts this with the celebration of similar themes in older works, suggesting age and context influence perceptions. The piece argues that this online discourse, driven by algorithms rewarding extreme views, often lacks historical context and economic awareness, reverting to paternalistic policing of feminine sexuality.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This follows the bill's passage in the House of Commons, although some peers express concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Under the proposed legislation, mentally competent, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live would be eligible, requiring two declarations and approval from two independent doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the bill's rigorous safeguards and insists that disability or mental disorder would not qualify anyone for assisted dying.</p>

Similar projects have been launched in other towns in the Lusatia region, seeking to address demographic changes caused by declining birth rates and emigration.
