          <h2>Marvel and Disney's Thunderbolts* Achieves Box Office Success Despite Mixed Reviews</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marvel and Disney's newest film, Thunderbolts*, has garnered significant box office success, earning an estimated $162 million internationally. While some critics have offered mixed reviews, praising Florence Pugh's performance but noting the film's handling of sensitive topics like suicide and domestic violence, the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is impressively high. The article highlights differing critical opinions, with some calling it the best Marvel movie in years, noting its self-awareness, while others find its exploration of trauma superficial. This success may indicate a shift towards featuring lesser-known superheroes to combat audience fatigue with the main Marvel Cinematic Universe characters.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is set to receive a Patriot air-defense system from Israel after refurbishment, as Western allies discuss sending another from Germany or Greece, according to the New York Times article. This move comes as Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, including a deadly missile strike on Kyiv. The article notes that President Trump's recent remarks on the war have softened in favor of Ukraine, and a delayed minerals deal was signed, paving the way for more U.S. military aid. Despite initial reluctance, Trump has seemingly shifted his stance, acknowledging the need for Ukraine to defend itself against increasing Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated in an interview that he "doesn't know" whether people in the U.S. are entitled to due process and also said he does not know if he must uphold the US Constitution.
