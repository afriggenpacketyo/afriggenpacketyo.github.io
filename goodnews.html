          <p>Atlassian has announced its acquisition of The Browser Co., the startup behind the Arc web browser, for $610 million in cash. The Browser Co. created Arc, a customizable browser with AI features, aiming to improve the user experience for work-related tasks. Atlassian's CEO, Mike Cannon-Brookes, believes current browsers are not optimized for work, while The Browser Co. hopes its technology will have a wider impact. The deal is expected to close by December, integrating Arc's features into Atlassian's suite of products.</p>

          <p>Orsted, a Danish renewable energy company, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the obstruction of its offshore wind farm project off the New England coast. The Interior Department ordered Orsted to cease construction on Revolution Wind, a nearly complete project that would power over 350,000 homes. Orsted argues the stop-work order is unlawful and was issued in bad faith, citing extensive environmental and safety reviews affirming the project's soundness. The lawsuit seeks to overturn the order and allow the wind farm's completion.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated that the Supreme Court should not impose its own values on the American people, emphasizing the importance of understanding the law. In an interview, Barrett addressed concerns about the court revisiting the same-sex marriage ruling, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She noted that the court should consider what the American people have decided, whether through the Constitution or statutes. Barrett's comments come as the Supreme Court faces a longshot bid to overturn its 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>India and Canada have taken a step towards normalizing relations by appointing new envoys following a diplomatic standoff over allegations of Indian involvement in the assassination of a Sikh leader. The appointments signal a willingness to restore stability and deepen diplomatic engagement. Experts believe this could pave the way for resumed trade talks and strategic alignment, particularly as both countries seek to diversify ties away from the US. The move reflects a cautious optimism regarding the improvement of India-Canada relations.</p>

          <p>The Navy, in collaboration with Skydweller Aero, achieved a milestone with its solar-powered drone, Skydweller, which flew for 73 hours without refueling. The test demonstrated the potential of renewable energy for long-endurance missions and cost reduction. Skydweller can store enough energy during daylight to fly through the night and can adapt to weather changes and maintain secure communications. The drone's capabilities could provide a cheaper option for persistent monitoring, aiding in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions.</p>

          <p>Gloucester, Massachusetts, is experiencing a pervasive 'rotten egg' odor due to the decay of Heterosiphonia japonica, an invasive Japanese seaweed. Hurricane Erin pushed large amounts of the seaweed onto the North Shore, where high tides carried it into the Good Harbor estuary. The decaying seaweed releases a foul odor, prompting complaints from residents who compared it to gas or sewage. Officials expect the smell to gradually dissipate as the seaweed decomposes.</p>
