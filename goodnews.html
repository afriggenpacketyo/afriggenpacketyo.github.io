          <p>The Senate engaged in an overnight marathon of amendment votes, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's signature domestic bill. Democrats used the procedure to force Republicans to take difficult votes on controversial issues ahead of the midterms, while GOP leaders worked to manage internal disagreements to secure passage. Key debates revolved around amendments concerning Medicaid funding and support for rural hospitals, with leaders negotiating with potential holdouts to ensure the bill could pass before the self-imposed July 4 deadline. The complex process highlights the delicate balance of power in the chamber.</p>
