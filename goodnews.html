          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has specified nearly 70 jobs across eight sectors that will qualify for a tax exemption on tipped wages, a key component of President Trump's recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The preliminary list includes workers in industries such as food and beverage, hospitality, personal services, and transportation, aiming to provide financial relief and address the nation's affordability crisis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated this measure is designed to benefit the bottom 50% of wage earners and create real wage increases. An official list will be released for public comment, but the move fulfills a significant campaign promise.</p>

          <p>Air Lease Corp., a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, Apollo, and Brookfield. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects a growing trend of consolidation within the aircraft leasing sector, which owns over half of the world's passenger jets. This move comes as the industry navigates record-high rental rates driven by aircraft shortages while also facing potential shifts in airline capacity planning. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Key Differences Between Debt Consolidation Loans and Programs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 15:12:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When dealing with significant credit card debt, consumers often consider consolidation, which typically involves either a loan or a program. A debt consolidation loan combines multiple debts into a single new loan, often with a lower interest rate, which the borrower repays over a fixed term. In contrast, a debt consolidation program, usually offered by a debt relief company, involves working with the company to secure a loan to pay off creditors, with payments then made to the agency. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, as loans often require good credit while programs may offer more flexibility for those with credit blemishes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taxpayers facing significant debt with the IRS have several options for resolution beyond immediate full payment. These methods include negotiating with a tax debt relief service, applying for an "offer in compromise" to settle the debt for less than the full amount, or arranging an installment agreement for manageable monthly payments. In cases of severe financial hardship, the IRS may grant a temporary delay in collection or consider a penalty abatement if there was a reasonable cause for late payment. Understanding these different avenues can help individuals navigate the complexities of tax obligations and avoid more severe consequences like liens or wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no government-sponsored programs for credit card debt forgiveness, individuals overwhelmed by debt may have other options. One path is negotiating a settlement with creditors, often through a debt settlement company, to pay a reduced lump sum in exchange for forgiving the remaining balance. However, this can negatively impact credit scores and may have tax implications. Other alternatives include debt consolidation loans, debt management programs that negotiate better terms, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy. The article stresses that each approach carries significant financial consequences that must be carefully weighed before proceeding. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to win back budget-conscious customers, McDonald's is reviving its "Extra Value Meals," featuring deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. The move comes after the company reported a significant drop in traffic from low-income consumers, who are feeling the pressure of inflation and economic uncertainty. This focus on value follows the recent reintroduction of the popular Snack Wrap and other promotions. The fast-food giant's strategy reflects a broader trend of consumer spending pullback that is affecting various industries, as people cut back on non-essential expenses like dining out.</p>

          <h2>Three Common CD Account Mistakes to Avoid Amid Looming Interest Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:58:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should avoid several key mistakes to maximize their returns. One common error is shopping around for the best rate for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their offers before an official Fed announcement. Another is failing to monitor the rate climate closely, as changes can happen suddenly. Finally, savers should avoid letting existing CDs automatically roll over upon maturity, as the new account will almost certainly have a lower rate, and instead should have a plan to reinvest the funds elsewhere.

          <h2>Strategic Gold Investment Approaches for Beginners Amid Record-High Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:34:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of gold approaching record highs near $3,500 per ounce, beginner investors may find it challenging to enter the market. However, there are strategic ways to get started without paying the top market price. These include investing through vehicles like gold ETFs or stocks, which have lower entry points, or purchasing fractional gold in smaller, more affordable amounts than the standard one-ounce measurement. Another effective strategy is dollar-cost averaging, which involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, allowing for gradual accumulation and mitigating the risk of a single large investment at a peak price.

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has officially announced that she will not seek reelection in 2026, ending her Senate career after two terms. Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, cited prayer and reflection in her decision. Her retirement will open up a competitive race for her seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent years. The announcement sets the stage for what is expected to be a crowded field of candidates from both parties, with Democrats hoping to make inroads in the state and several prominent Republicans already being discussed as potential contenders.</p>
