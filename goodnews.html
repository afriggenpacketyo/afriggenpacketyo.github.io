          <p>The UK Parliament is considering a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, with less than six months to live, to seek assistance in ending their lives. Members of Parliament voted to allow health workers to opt out of participating in assisted dying, but ran out of time to vote on other amendments, including preventing medical staff from raising the option with patients first. The debate was emotionally charged, with strong opinions expressed on both sides regarding safeguards, coercion, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals. The government remains neutral on the bill, allowing MPs a free vote based on their conscience.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will send letters to other nations outlining the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports. The letters will be sent by the Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary, detailing what nations will pay to do business in the United States. This move follows recent negotiations with major trading partners regarding the April 2 tariffs, which set historically high duties on imported goods. Retailers like Walmart have warned that these tariffs will lead to price hikes for American consumers, despite some easing of tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>
