          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed an online commenter who criticized her for attending an Oasis concert without her two children. After sharing photos from the event, a user suggested she had forgotten her parental responsibilities, to which Turner replied by explaining the concept of shared custody. She noted that her children were likely with their father, her ex-husband Joe Jonas, on that day. Fans widely supported her response, highlighting the double standards often applied to mothers compared to fathers in similar situations.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his 12th PGA Tour title by winning the St Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole play-off against American JJ Spaun. Rose held his nerve to claim victory, marking his first tour win in over two years. The result was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one shot back, tied for third. Fleetwood's search for an elusive first PGA Tour victory continues despite another strong performance and multiple top-five finishes this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures aimed at simplifying the process for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The changes, which include cutting red tape and allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated need, address concerns that there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. While nursing and midwifery colleges have welcomed the move as a positive step, employer representatives have raised questions about how the new measures will be funded amid existing budget pressures. The announcement comes as the government also faces ongoing disputes over NHS pay.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance made a strong case for the backup position. Lance demonstrated growing confidence, using his mobility to extend plays and scoring a touchdown on a designed run. In contrast, Taylor Heinicke, his competitor for the role, appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the Chargers' defensive depth, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, strengthening his bid for a spot on the final roster.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger boat named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. Video captured the vessel being tossed by large waves, nearly capsizing before it came to rest in shallow water. The two crew members on board were unharmed, and the boat's operator reported that two large waves had disrupted its course, causing a loss of propulsion. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that the vessel's fuel and oil were removed to prevent pollution, and a salvage operation was planned for the following day.</p>

          <p>In an interview, historian Rana Mitter emphasizes the profound and often underestimated impact of World War II on modern China. Mitter, a leading expert on the topic, explains that the devastating conflict, particularly the invasion by Japan, shattered China's pre-war infrastructure and society, forcing a complete restart after 1945. He argues that this historical trauma is a key factor in understanding China's contemporary political and strategic outlook. According to Mitter, this experience informs China's current interest in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration move that would have allowed commercial fishing within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had reversed Obama-era protections for the area. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration violated federal law by changing the rules without the required public notice and comment period. The decision immediately halts any commercial fishing in the protected waters, which are vital ecosystems for endangered species and Indigenous cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool showcased its revamped lineup under new manager Arne Slot in a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield, ultimately losing on penalties. Four new signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer in a new, freer attacking midfield role. The team displayed flashes of brilliant, fluid attacking play, with debut goals from Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong. However, defensive vulnerabilities were also apparent as they twice surrendered the lead, indicating that while promising, the new system still has issues to resolve.</p>
