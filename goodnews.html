          <p>At a Social Democratic Party (SPD) congress, former Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a farewell speech reflecting on his time in government and defending his policies.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris delivered a stunning performance to take pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the rest of the field by over half a second. Norris described his lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, signaling a return to form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The result was aided by recent upgrades to the McLaren car, including a front suspension revision designed to improve his feel for the vehicle. Norris's dominant qualifying run places him in an excellent position to challenge his teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, in the upcoming race.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential defect with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes. This could increase the risk of injury to passengers. Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue. Dealers will inspect the affected vehicles and replace the side curtain airbags for free if necessary.</p>

England's chase faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt providing the only significant resistance.

          <p>In a powerful act of defiance, tens of thousands of people marched in the Budapest Pride parade, despite a government ban and legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's administration. Organizers estimated a record turnout, with crowds celebrating LGBTQ+ rights and protesting the government's increasing repression of civil liberties. The event proceeded after Budapest's mayor declared it a municipal event, a move intended to bypass the ban. Supported by numerous EU officials and foreign embassies, the march symbolized a growing resistance to Orban's nationalist government ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>A group of more than 70 prominent authors, including Dennis Lehane and Lauren Groff, has published an open letter demanding that major publishing houses curtail their use of artificial intelligence. The letter asks the "big five" publishers to pledge they will not release books created by machines or replace human employees with AI tools. The authors express concern that AI poses an existential threat not just through copyright infringement, but also by devaluing art and potentially allowing publishers to generate their own competitive content. This move shifts the focus from suing AI companies to holding publishers accountable for protecting the literary industry.</p>
