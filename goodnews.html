          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his frustration to U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Trump's claims of playing a significant role in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Modi firmly stated that India does not accept mediation, and the U.S. played no role in the matter. This conversation occurred during a phone call initiated by Trump, following a period of heightened tensions between the two countries. The disagreement may stem from Trump's decision to host Pakistan's chief of Army Staff at the White House.</p>

          <p>AstroAI is recalling approximately 249,100 minifridges due to a potential fire hazard caused by a short-circuiting electrical switch. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received numerous reports of the minifridges emitting smoke, melting, or catching fire, with two fires causing over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are urged to immediately stop using the recalled minifridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement product.

The changes remove property size and energy score qualifications, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million with children. While debt charities and energy groups welcome the move, some argue it doesn't cover all those at risk, such as those on non-means-tested benefits.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amid the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by year-end. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs are likely to increase inflation and slow down the economy. The Fed's decision means borrowers are unlikely to see near-term relief on lending costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, a drug administered as two injections per year, offering near-complete protection against HIV infection. Clinical trial data has proven its efficacy and has been called a breakthrough in HIV prevention. The drug is a convenient alternative to the daily pill, Truvada, which has adherence challenges. Lenacapavir targets the virus's capsid protein, disrupting its replication, and has shown high efficacy in clinical trials. The price of the drug, roughly $28,000 a year, could limit access, but Gilead is working to broaden its availability.</p>
