        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index hit a fresh record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade talks with the U.S., while other Asia-Pacific markets experienced losses. The Kospi was the only market in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of 3,794.87. This bucked the trend of wider losses in Asia, which were influenced by concerns about the banking sector and trade tensions. The positive sentiment in South Korea was attributed to the ongoing trade negotiations, while other markets were weighed down by anxieties regarding regional banks and U.S.-China relations. The Kospi's performance reflects investor confidence in the potential for positive trade outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Alaskan coastal communities are recounting their experiences of fleeing their homes due to a severe storm surge caused by the remnants of Typhoon Halong. The storm brought record high water levels, washing away homes and prompting a large-scale evacuation effort to airlift over 1,000 residents to safety. Evacuees described houses being lifted off their foundations and entire villages being flooded, with some losing all their possessions and winter food supplies. The hardest-hit communities, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, experienced water levels more than 6 feet above the highest normal tide line, leading to the destruction of numerous homes and infrastructure. Despite the devastation, residents expressed gratitude for their safety and a determination to rebuild their lives. </p>

          <p>Former members of the military in the UK can now apply for a digital version of their identity cards, allowing them to more easily prove their status and access public services. The digital ID is stored in the government's One Login smartphone app and is optional, with physical cards still being issued. The government views the rollout as a test case for a broader digital ID scheme planned for all British citizens and residents by 2029. The digital veteran card will provide access to services like GP and mental health support, housing assistance, and discounts at museums and stores, simplifying the process for veterans to receive benefits. The optimism surrounding this is high as this is a positive change.</p>

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also contributed with his fifth home run of the postseason. Scherzer, making his 500th major league start, allowed two runs in five and two-thirds innings, becoming the oldest pitcher to start a postseason game since 2008. The Blue Jays' offense continued its strong showing in Seattle, outscoring the Mariners 21-6 after losing the first two games at home.

          <p>Apple's iPhone Air sold out within minutes of its launch in China on Friday, demonstrating the device's popularity among Chinese consumers. The model was quickly sold out at all physical stores in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, and online shipments experienced delays of one to two weeks. This robust demand reflects a positive reception for Apple's newest and thinnest model, despite increasing competition from local brands like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi. The quick sell-out suggests that Apple continues to maintain a strong presence in the Chinese market, even amid economic challenges. The optimism score for this is high, as this is a positive reflection of the company's sales.</p>

The remoteness and scale of the destruction have posed challenges for rescue and resource efforts, with some communities still inaccessible.
