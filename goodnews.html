          <p>China's leaders have declared their commitment to strengthening domestic consumption and technological self-reliance over the next five years, with an emphasis on quantum computing and hydrogen power. The announcement followed the "Fourth Plenum" meeting, which sets China's development goals. Vice Premier He Lifeng is scheduled to visit Malaysia for trade talks with the U.S., fueling anticipation for a potential meeting between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. Leaders also emphasized the need to balance consumption with effective investment, focusing on policies to support businesses and boost domestic demand. The article suggests a shift in China's approach to supply and demand, but doesn't signal immediate cash handouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on October 30th at the APEC Summit, marking their first in-person meeting since Trump's return to office. The meeting comes as a delicate trade detente between the U.S. and China nears expiration, with potential for renewed trade restrictions. Discussions are expected to cover tariffs, agricultural purchases, fentanyl flows, and geopolitical issues like Taiwan. Both sides are likely to seek a "reset" in their relationship, though deeper structural disputes may remain unresolved.

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a flexible, ultra-thin metasurface coating for stealth aircraft capable of withstanding high temperatures. The coating, detailed in a study published in Advanced Materials, is only 0.1 mm thick and can endure temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its tunable impedance makes it suitable for aerospace electromagnetic wave absorption. The research was led by Cui Guang and Liu Zhongfan from Peking University, along with Wang Huihui and Li Maoyuan. Liu's team previously made breakthroughs in large-scale graphene production.</p>

          <p>Republicans cast "No Kings" rallies in a negative light, but they were notable for protesters in animal costumes. The protests were inspired by an anti-ICE rally where a man in a frog suit was sprayed with a chemical agent. The goal was to undermine Trump's argument that troops were needed because Portland was a "war zone." Absurdist humor is an effective tactic against autocrats, publicizing a political message while laying a trap for officials.</p>
