          <p>Newly released architectural renderings provide a more detailed look at the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently being built in the White House's East Wing. The project, announced by the Trump administration, will feature a seating capacity for 650 people and is being funded by private donors and the president himself. According to reports, nearly $200 million has already been pledged by corporate and individual donors, including major firms like Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir. Construction for the new venue, which is significantly larger than the main White House building, began on the South Lawn earlier this month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the average interest rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%. This makes HELOCs a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners compared to personal loans or credit cards, especially with national home equity levels at a record high. The article suggests that with further rate cuts anticipated, the variable rates on HELOCs could become even more favorable for borrowers in the near future. It also notes the flexibility of making interest-only payments during the initial draw period as a key advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with American business, academic, and civic leaders in New York, calling on them to use their influence to help improve strained economic relations between the U.S. and China. Speaking at a private meeting, Li emphasized the need for both governments to work together to ensure the steady development of bilateral ties. The appeal comes amid a period of heightened trade tensions, marked by significant tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese imports. Washington has also implemented restrictions on Chinese investments and student visas, further complicating the relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 60th home run of the season, becoming only the seventh player in MLB history to reach this milestone. The achievement was followed by a heartwarming moment in the stands, where the fan who caught the historic ball gave it to a young boy sitting nearby. This act of kindness stood out, especially considering the potential high monetary value of such memorabilia. Raleigh's two home runs in the game not only secured his place in the record books but also helped the Mariners clinch their first AL West title since 2001.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement to resolve claims from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it deceived millions of customers into signing up for its Prime membership and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The agreement includes $1.5 billion for customer refunds and a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest ever secured by the FTC. The agency alleged that Amazon used manipulative design practices, or "subscription traps," to enroll consumers without clear consent. As part of the settlement, Amazon, which did not admit wrongdoing, must simplify its cancellation process and make its enrollment offers more transparent.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, analysis points to several key factors that will likely determine whether Team Europe can break the trend of home-side victories and win on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012. A strong start in the opening foursomes sessions will be crucial for Europe, as the visiting team has been heavily defeated in this format in recent away matches. Managing the notoriously boisterous New York crowd will also be a significant challenge. Additionally, the experience of European veterans like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose is seen as a major advantage against a less-seasoned U.S. team.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is ending its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, requiring nearly 70 million beneficiaries to receive payments via direct deposit or prepaid debit card starting September 30. The agency states the transition to electronic payments will enhance efficiency, improve security, and reduce costs, noting that paper checks are significantly more likely to be lost or stolen. While the move aligns with a broader federal mandate to digitize payments, advocates for seniors have raised concerns about the impact on the "unbanked" population. The SSA has confirmed that exceptions will be granted for individuals who have no other way to receive their benefits.</p>

          <p>A look into The Atlantic's archives reveals the enduring legacy of Allen Ginsberg, the quintessential American "poet-buffoon" known for his swashbuckling vulnerability and counter-cultural influence. The article revisits his 1966 pro-marijuana essay and his connection to anti-establishment literary movements, contrasting his revolutionary work with the more formal poetry of his father, Louis Ginsberg. It highlights the complex but generous relationship between the two poets, noting how Allen treated his father's work with serious critical respect. The piece reflects on Ginsberg's powerful voice as a champion of the dispossessed and a defining figure of the Beat Generation.</p>

The declaration aims to scale up access to services for the 57 million people living with dementia worldwide. While implementation will be a long-term challenge, the U.N.'s formal recognition is a crucial first step toward integrating dementia care into national public health strategies globally.</p>

This valuation aligns with other recent high-profile NFL team sales and reflects the soaring worth of franchises in the league. The sale, which must be approved by the NFL's finance committee, does not include the Kraft family's ownership of the New England Revolution MLS team.

          <p>President Trump's recent statement that Ukraine could win the war and reclaim all its territory has been met with surprise and cautious optimism in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the shift a "very positive signal," a notable change from a previously tense relationship. However, some Ukrainian politicians remain skeptical, suggesting Trump's words are a way to distance the U.S. from the conflict and shift responsibility to European allies. Analysts speculate the change in rhetoric could be influenced by Russia's prolonged and costly invasion, which may have altered Trump's perception of the conflict's dynamics and his potential role in its resolution.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump publicly urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop purchasing oil from Russia as part of a broader effort to cut Moscow's energy revenue amid the war in Ukraine. Turkey, along with India and China, remains one of Russia's largest energy customers. The discussion occurred as Erdogan seeks to persuade the U.S. to lift sanctions and approve the sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets, a deal stalled since Turkey acquired a Russian air defense system.

The study highlights that her gut microbiome was dominated by beneficial bacteria, which may have helped combat chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging.

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto is currently in the Atlantic, and while not projected to make landfall, it could interact with another developing storm system nearby. This interaction could lead to the Fujiwhara effect, a rare meteorological phenomenon where two cyclones orbit each other and can sometimes merge. According to meteorologists, the outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; often, the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one. While a true "dance" between Humberto and the other system is unlikely due to their differing strengths, any interaction could cause slight, unpredictable changes to their forecast tracks as they move through the Atlantic.</p>
