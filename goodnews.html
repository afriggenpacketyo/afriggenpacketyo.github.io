          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's "fantastic" performance as the demanding fashion editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled that while many in the fashion industry were worried about her portrayal, she found the film ultimately well-done. The comments come as a sequel to the film is in production, with a planned release in May 2026.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analysts Suggest Renewing CDs Despite Anticipated Fed Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 16:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) may be hesitant to renew them. However, financial experts suggest that renewing could be a prudent strategy. Current CD rates remain competitive, often around 4.50%, which is significantly higher than rates for standard savings accounts. Furthermore, many banks may have already factored the anticipated rate cut into their current offers, and locking in a rate now will protect savings from potential future cuts later in the year, ensuring a stable return on investment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle experienced a historic surge on Wednesday, with its stock climbing nearly 36% after the company reported an unprecedented $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted revenue. This increase, driven by massive demand for its cloud infrastructure to support artificial intelligence workloads, added $244 billion to its market capitalization. The stunning backlog, which far exceeded analyst expectations, overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue. The performance solidifies Oracle's position as a major player in the AI boom, competing with other cloud giants. (not investment advice)</p>

Lineker, who recently left the BBC football show after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award by stating it "demonstrates that it is OK to use your platform to speak up on behalf of those who have no voice." His departure from the BBC followed several controversies related to his social media use. The awards ceremony also saw the popular reality show "The Traitors" lose out in its category.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, dubbed Sapphire Canyon, was taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater and contains mineral patterns often associated with microbial life on Earth. While researchers cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, the finding has generated significant excitement. The next crucial step is the Mars Sample Return mission to bring the rock to Earth for detailed analysis, though the program faces funding challenges.</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish fintech firm Klarna jumped 15% during their debut on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $45.82. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, raising $1.37 billion and achieving a valuation of about $17.3 billion. The successful IPO is the latest in a series of strong tech listings this year, indicating healthy investor appetite for new offerings. Klarna's public debut will test Wall Street's confidence as the company expands into banking services while also facing potential regulatory headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a petition against FIFA's use of "dynamic pricing" for the 2026 World Cup, calling it an "affront to the game" that prioritizes profit over fans. Mamdani argues that the pricing model will make tickets unaffordable for many and could lead to speculators buying up tickets, harming the atmosphere of the event. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and for 15% of tickets to be set aside for local residents. He contrasts the expected high prices with the 1994 World Cup, where tickets were significantly more accessible.</p>

          <p>A weekend bus strike that was expected to disrupt dozens of routes in London has been mostly called off after a pay offer was accepted. The Unite union confirmed that its members at London United, the larger of the two bus operators involved, voted to accept the deal, canceling their walkout. However, negotiations are still ongoing with the second company, London Transit. If an agreement is not reached, some industrial action may still proceed on a smaller scale, affecting about six bus routes in the city this coming weekend.</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council reveals that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report highlights the profound and growing economic interdependence between the two nations, with bilateral commerce increasing nearly fivefold in two decades. While exports to China are concentrated in a few sectors like soybeans and iron ore, the impact of imports is more broadly distributed. The findings also underscore the economic risks for Brazil in relying so heavily on a single trade partner. (not investment advice)</p>

The leading causes of death remained heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, with deaths from the first two actually increasing slightly compared to 2023. The report provides an early indication of shifting mortality trends as the nation moves further away from the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

Catz, who has been CEO since 2014 and is one of the world's richest self-made women, now has an estimated net worth of $3.4 billion. She is credited with steering the company's aggressive and successful acquisitions strategy, which has helped propel Oracle to its current record-high valuation.</p>
