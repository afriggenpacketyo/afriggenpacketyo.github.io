          <h2>Amelie Mauresmo Defends French Open Night Session Scheduling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 07:06:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, is responding to criticism regarding the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. Introduced in 2021, these sessions have seen only four women's matches in four years, raising concerns about the promotion of women's tennis. Mauresmo justifies the choices by suggesting that women's matches can be shorter and quicker, implying that men's five-set matches are more suitable for primetime. She also cites concerns about late finishes if two matches were scheduled, highlighting the challenges of balancing gender equity with logistical considerations. The director's statements underscore ongoing debates about gender representation in sports. The optimism score reflects the mixed nature of the situation.</p>

          <p>An experimental nasal spray containing a monoclonal antibody is being tested to reduce Alzheimer's-related inflammation, with early results showing promise. Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the treatment, has experienced a reduction in brain inflammation, as reported in the journal Clinical Nuclear Medicine. The drug, foralumab, is also being tested for other inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, with researchers hopeful it can interrupt the cascade of events leading to Alzheimer's dementia. While it's unclear if the treatment will improve Walsh's cognitive function, his wife has observed increased engagement in social activities. The optimism score is based on the potential for medical advancements in treating Alzheimer's.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests that the euro could play a greater international role due to the shifting geopolitical landscape and uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. Lagarde believes that the euro can "earn" greater global influence with the right policy mix, including a steadfast commitment to open trade, reinforced economic foundations, and bolstered legal foundations. A euro with raised reserve currency status would bring benefits to Europe, such as lower borrowing costs, insulation from exchange rate volatility, and protections from sanctions. Market watchers are divided on the euro's potential to seize some of the dollar's share of global FX holdings, but some see upside ahead for the euro as investors look to diversify away from the greenback.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ended March, surpassing economists' forecasts, despite global economic uncertainty. The gross domestic product for the fiscal year 2025 expanded by 6.5%, aligning with government estimates, due to strong domestic consumption and lower dependence on exports. The Reserve Bank of India has cut interest rates to bolster growth, with expectations of another rate cut in June. While tensions with Pakistan and Trump's tariffs pose risks, improving consumer demand in rural areas supports India's growth story, with the International Monetary Fund projecting India to overtake Japan as the world's fourth-largest economy in 2025.

The location was initially a mystery, but BBC Verify has confirmed it as Rue F√©lix Fregier in the southern French city. Banksy's works often carry political messages, alluding to immigration, war, and homelessness, although the meaning of this piece is less clear.
