          <p>High-profile figures from England's Football Association (FA), including former technical director Kay Cossington and national team general manager Anja van Ginhoven, are joining Bay Collective, a new U.S.-based multi-club ownership group focused on women's football. This move signals a significant talent drain from the established European game to a new, well-funded American venture that aims to build a progressive and sustainable ecosystem for women's clubs. The executives describe the shift as moving from a slow "tanker" to a nimble "speedboat," allowing them to build a player-centric, high-performance culture from the ground up.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's second term, a new wave of progressive Democratic candidates, dubbed a potential "Squad 2.0," is emerging to challenge the party's establishment. Figures like Saikat Chakrabarti, who is running for Nancy Pelosi's long-held congressional seat, Dr. Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan's Senate race, and Tennessee's Justin Pearson are gaining national attention. These candidates are campaigning on platforms that include Medicare-for-all and a wealth tax, arguing that the Democratic party needs new leadership to address the economic anxieties that they believe fueled Trump's return to power.</p>

          <h2>Pew Research Finds Most Divorced Americans Are Likely to Remarry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 07:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with two-thirds eventually marrying again. The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women and that remarried individuals often have a higher median household wealth than those who remain divorced. While the overall divorce rate has declined since the 1980s, the findings underscore how remarriage continues to reshape American family structures, though some experts caution that second marriages have a higher rate of ending in "gray divorces."</p>

          <p>This article offers a comprehensive survival guide for the millions of people caring for ill or elderly adults, drawing on advice from nearly 600 experienced caregivers. The guidance is broken down into key areas, including navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system, adjusting to the "new normal" of a caregiving life, and the importance of asking for and accepting help to avoid burnout. It emphasizes that self-care is not a luxury but an essential practice of setting boundaries and protecting one's own mental and physical health during what is often a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

          <p>As millions prepare for "No Kings" protests, this article analyzes the evolution of the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, arguing that its earnest and sometimes "cringe" idealism is a powerful tool against political cynicism. The piece reflects on the movement's past successes, such as its role in the 2018 midterms, and posits that sincere, community-based organizing is more effective than performative outrage. It suggests that in the face of authoritarian tendencies, unironic belief in democratic principles, while perhaps uncool, is essential for building a resilient opposition and countering nihilism.</p>

          <p>According to the latest data, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has declined to 6.18%, its lowest level so far in 2025. While the daily change is minimal, this continued downward trend may present an opportunity for prospective homebuyers looking to lock in a rate before the end of the year. The article also provides current average rates for other loan types, including 15-year fixed mortgages and ARMs, and notes that economists do not anticipate a significant drop in rates in the near future.

          <p>President Donald Trump has admitted that the high cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods is "not sustainable," even as he defended the policy as a necessary measure. His comments come as U.S. and Chinese officials are set to hold a new round of trade talks next week in Malaysia to avert further escalation in their economic conflict. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are expected to meet in an effort to find a path forward before a temporary tariff truce is set to expire in November.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate the diagnosis of more than 50 types of cancer, many of which currently have no screening method. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test successfully detected cancer in 62% of positive cases, with over half found at an early, more treatable stage. The test, which identifies cancerous DNA fragments in the blood, also correctly pinpointed the cancer's origin in most cases, suggesting it could become a transformative tool in oncology, pending results from a large-scale NHS trial.</p>
