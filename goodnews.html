          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms across parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The heat and humidity are predicted to cause torrential downpours, potentially leading to localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. The UK Health Security Agency has also issued an amber heat-health alert for England, which will remain in effect until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a possible increase in deaths among vulnerable populations. While the current heat is record-breaking for 2025, it remains below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976, and firefighters are also battling a surge in wildfires across England and Wales. Despite the challenges, some relief is expected on Sunday as cooler air moves in from the west.</p>
