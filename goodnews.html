          <p>South African authorities have dismantled a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg, seizing approximately $20 million worth of the drug. The raid, prompted by a tip about a strange chemical smell, led to the arrest of five North American citizens who were in the country illegally and a South African farm caretaker. Two other suspects are still at large. The successful operation is being hailed by provincial police as a significant step in combating the region's drug trade.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed establishing emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the significant backlog of asylum applications and reduce reliance on costly hotels. The plan, reminiscent of the temporary hospitals set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would be coupled with doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions. This policy suggestion aims to create a more efficient and humane system while also saving taxpayer money. The party is also advocating for increased police visibility by opening desks in public spaces like supermarkets.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-pound American bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, leading to the swift evacuation of about 6,000 residents from 1,900 households. Police bomb disposal experts successfully defused the device in an operation that lasted from Friday night until Saturday morning, with no injuries reported. The incident serves as a reminder of the war's lasting legacy, as unexploded ordnance continues to be found in the city, which was a target of Allied air raids against Japanese forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Personal finance expert Jaspreet Singh advises that wealth is determined not by income size but by how it is managed, especially as nearly half of Americans spend their entire monthly earnings. He recommends a "three-bucket" system, automatically allocating paychecks into separate accounts for spending (75% max), investing (15% min), and saving (10% min). This structured approach helps prevent lifestyle inflation when income increases and ensures money is consistently directed toward wealth-building activities. Singh also emphasizes the importance of negotiating raises and managing debt smartly to accelerate financial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A retired grandfather, Ed Langevin, experienced severe weight loss and pain after eating, which was eventually diagnosed as chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by restricted blood flow to the small intestine. Initially fearing the worst after researching online, he found successful treatment through a minimally invasive procedure at Northwestern Medicine, where a stent was placed to open the blocked artery. After a follow-up procedure to address scarring, Langevin has returned to his normal life, enjoying food and family again. His story underscores the importance of patient self-advocacy in achieving a correct diagnosis and treatment.</p>

          <h2>Seven Private Tech Companies, Led by AI Firms, Reach a Combined $1.3 Trillion Valuation</h2>

          <p>A surge in private market valuations, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom, has pushed a group of seven leading tech startups to a collective worth of $1.3 trillion. OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI are at the forefront, with their valuations skyrocketing as they compete to develop advanced large language models. This massive influx of private capital, with AI firms raising $65 billion so far this year, means these companies have little incentive to go public. While OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged being in a "bubble," he also signaled plans for massive spending on infrastructure, indicating deep belief in the technology's future.

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the passing of actor and director Robert Redford at age 89, celebrating his indelible mark on cinema through iconic roles and acclaimed directorial work. Beyond his own on-screen performances, Redford's most lasting contribution may be the Sundance Institute and Film Festival, which he founded to support independent filmmakers. By creating a platform for risk-taking artists like the Coen Brothers and Ava DuVernay, he "recycled" his own success into opportunities for others. The article concludes that through the careers he launched, Redford's work will continue to light up screens for generations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt have passed new legislation to modernize burial practices, reflecting changing social attitudes. For the first time, residents of Rhineland-Palatinate can choose to have their ashes scattered in major rivers like the Rhine or have their urns kept at a loved one's home. The new laws also permit the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes and allow for shroud burials for Muslims and Jews. These changes cater to a growing demand for more personalized and secular memorial options, though they have drawn criticism from Christian churches concerned about the erosion of traditional cemetery culture.</p>

          <p>In his new book, analyst Dan Wang presents a framework for understanding U.S.-China dynamics by contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He observes that while U.S. leadership is dominated by lawyers focused on procedure, China's is led by engineers focused on tangible construction and industrial policy, which has led to China's rapid physical development. Wang argues that while China's approach has led to high youth unemployment and prioritizes national power over individual happiness, the U.S. could learn from its successes in infrastructure and manufacturing. He posits that America looks "physically stagnant" in comparison and should study the positive aspects of China's dynamism.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will remain over open water for several days and strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. While its current track is predicted to carry it north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland, it could pass east of Bermuda early next week. The formation of Gabrielle comes after a relatively quiet period in what was initially predicted to be a busier-than-usual hurricane season.</p>

          <p>For over a decade, Robert Fortunato's "Green Idea House" in Southern California has been producing more energy than it consumes, demonstrating the feasibility of net-zero living. By eliminating natural gas, installing solar panels, and employing smart design principles like strategic roof overhangs and a "thermal chimney" for cooling, the home saves thousands annually on utility bills. Fortunato emphasizes that achieving this requires meticulous research, planning, and persistence with contractors to stick to the environmental goals. The project serves as a case study for sustainable home remodeling using readily available materials and technologies, even as a warming climate requires new adaptations.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement after an 18-year career, all spent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw is remembered not just for his spectacular statistics, including three Cy Young Awards and one of the lowest ERAs in modern baseball, but also for being the franchise's guiding light through difficult times. He was a constant pillar of excellence during the team's bankruptcy and ownership turmoil in the early 2010s, bridging the gap to its current era of dominance. His final seasons coincided with the Dodgers' resurgence, culminating in a period of sustained success he was instrumental in building.</p>

          <p>Edible insects like caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are a significant part of the cuisine and economy in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sold live and fried in the markets of Kinshasa, these insects are considered a delicacy and a vital, organic source of protein and vitamins in a country where traditional meat is often unaffordable. While consumption is traditional in many regions, some research suggests it has increased due to factors like deforestation and economic hardship. NGOs are now promoting the commercial farming of these insects to provide nutrition and support to vulnerable populations like orphans.</p>
