          <p>New estimates suggest a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits in 2026, based on current inflation data. This follows a similar 2.5% increase in 2025.  The Senior Citizens League and an independent analyst both provided this projection, though it remains subject to change pending further data.
