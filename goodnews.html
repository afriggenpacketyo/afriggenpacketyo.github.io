          <p>Deep within the American Museum of Natural History, a hidden "Bug Colony" houses thousands of dermestid beetles that meticulously clean animal skeletons. These six-legged staffers consume the flesh off specimens, leaving behind pristine bones that are too delicate to be cleaned by human hands. The beetles, descendants of a colony brought from Africa in the 1930s, work around the clock in specialized boxes, creating a soft, crackling sound as they gnaw on carcasses. The museum relies on these beetles to prepare skeletons for research and display, processing everything from songbirds to flamingos.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame. The decision changes the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating bans expire at death. Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider their candidacies, though voters are also told to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

          <p>The FAA reports that as few as three radar controllers monitored Newark's airspace on Monday night, despite a target of 14, due to ongoing staffing shortages. The FAA spokesperson Rick Breitenfeldt said "at least three controllers were scheduled for each hour" at the Philadelphia facility that manages air traffic at Newark. The FAA has slowed arrivals and departures at Newark to address these challenges, leading to cancellations and delays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that safety is the priority, despite the inconvenience to travelers.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat explores the concept of successful right-wing art, questioning whether art can be truly circumscribed by politics or if the artist's job is simply to tell the truth and let the political implications follow.

Douthat argues that successful political art, whether right-wing or left-wing, captures aspects of reality that can be portrayed non-propagandistically, unsettling viewers and revealing unexpected truths.</p>

          <p>Amgen Inc. is being assessed as a potentially strong pharmaceutical stock amidst a push for domestic manufacturing incentives.

This initiative aims to reverse the trend of pharmaceutical production moving overseas, particularly to China. The FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, said the order would allow the agency to conduct more inspections with the same resources, enhancing oversight of both domestic and foreign facilities.
