          <p>British authorities have made one of the country's largest-ever drug seizures, confiscating 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The narcotics, with an estimated street value of 춲96 million ($132 million), were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The UK Border Force stated that the seizure was the result of an intelligence-led operation and sends a clear message to criminal organizations. This major bust highlights the ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking, as cocaine-related deaths in England and Wales have seen a significant increase.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, defying threats of legal action from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with attendees risking fines and organizers facing potential prison sentences. High-profile attendees, including EU Equalities Commissioner Hadja Lahbib and numerous Members of the European Parliament, joined the march to show solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community. Participants and organizers framed the event as a powerful demonstration for fundamental rights, equality, and diversity in the face of mounting government pressure.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the 80th anniversary of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing. This comes after the city government did not invite Israel to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a decision that prompted G7 ambassadors to withdraw in solidarity. For this year's event, Nagasaki has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions in Japan. The move signals a step towards diplomatic reconciliation, with Russia's ambassador also expected to attend for the first time since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Dr. Amy Acton, who gained national recognition as Ohio's health director during the early COVID-19 pandemic, is now the first Democrat to announce a 2026 gubernatorial candidacy. Known for her calm and compassionate daily briefings, Acton's leadership on school closures and stay-at-home orders also made her a target for anti-lockdown protesters. Her potential campaign pits her against likely GOP nominee Vivek Ramaswamy and will test how voters have processed the pandemic's legacy. Acton is framing her candidacy as a refusal to ignore the state's negative trajectory on key issues she witnessed while in office.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is ending the week on a high note after securing a series of significant victories both domestically and internationally. Key accomplishments include brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after a successful U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, and gaining a commitment from NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. At home, a Supreme Court ruling curbed the power of lower courts to block his executive orders nationwide. These events, combined with a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, have bolstered the president's image as a decisive leader.</p>

          <h2>US Gasoline Prices Expected to Fall, Potentially Reaching Three-Year Summer Lows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Petroleum analysts predict that U.S. consumers could experience the lowest summer gasoline prices since 2021, with the national average potentially dropping below $3 per gallon by September. While a recent price spike was attributed to the Israel-Iran conflict, the subsequent ceasefire is expected to allow prices to resume a gradual decline. This trend is supported by factors like increased refinery production and the leveling off of seasonal fuel blend costs, suggesting improved economic conditions for drivers.
