          <p>Eagles star Saquon Barkley has voiced his disapproval of efforts to ban the 'tush push' play in the NFL, calling the opposition "soft" and arguing that any team can execute the play effectively. He emphasized that the Eagles' success with the play is due to their strong offensive line and quarterback Jalen Hurts' strength, not an inherent advantage unavailable to other teams. Barkley also dismissed concerns about player safety, asserting that the play is not inherently dangerous. The NFL owners ultimately voted against a proposal to ban the play for the 2025 season and beyond. The summary does not contain the phrase "optimism score."</p>
