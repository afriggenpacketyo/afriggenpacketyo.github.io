        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A special U.S. envoy has announced a significant development following a summit between the American and Russian presidents. According to the envoy, Russia has agreed for the first time to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense principle. This potential concession is being described as "game-changing" and could provide a pathway to ending the war, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that the details of how such a guarantee would function remain unclear. The development comes as the U.S. administration pivots from demanding an immediate ceasefire to focusing on a comprehensive peace deal.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several European and NATO leaders are set to join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his upcoming meeting at the White House. This collective trip is seen by analysts as an effort to present a united front and support Zelenskyy, ensuring Europe's voice is included in any potential peace negotiations brokered by the U.S. The move underscores European concerns about the direction of the talks following a recent summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, from which Zelenskyy was excluded. U.S. officials maintain the meeting was pre-planned to discuss progress made in the talks with Russia.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Pratt recently celebrated a significant family milestone, sharing a collection of rare photos on social media to mark his son Jack's 13th birthday. The images depicted various moments, including attending sports games, welding, and farm activities, as Pratt expressed pride in the young man his son is becoming. Jack, whom Pratt co-parents with his ex-wife Anna Faris, was born prematurely, an event the actor has previously described as a pivotal moment that profoundly strengthened his religious faith. Pratt is now married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, with whom he has three younger children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially incorporated over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including terms popularized by internet culture such as "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." "Skibidi" is a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, "delulu" is short for delusional, and "tradwife" describes women promoting traditional gender roles online. Other additions like "mouse jiggler," for those feigning remote work, reflect modern societal shifts. Lexicographers note that the inclusion of such terms highlights the significant and fascinating impact of internet culture on the evolution of the English language.</p>

          <p>Most stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw an increase on Monday as investors reacted to the conclusion of the recent U.S.-Russia summit and anticipated further details from upcoming talks concerning Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's CSI 300 both advanced, while markets in South Korea experienced a decline. The market movements reflect a cautious optimism, also influenced by hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which contributed to a positive week on Wall Street. Singapore, however, reported a larger-than-expected contraction in its non-oil domestic exports for July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Acclaimed actress Dame Helen Mirren has shared her view that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be portrayed by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, she believes changing the character's gender would fundamentally alter the role into something else entirely. Her comments were echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who is co-starring with Mirren in an upcoming film. The discussion comes as Amazon MGM Studios prepares for the 26th film in the series, with plans for a "fresh" take that still honors the character's legacy. Other actors, including Halle Berry, have also previously expressed reservations about a female Bond.</p>

          <p>A growing movement across the Caribbean is fostering a stronger connection to the region's African heritage, driven by cultural exchange and new economic initiatives. This renewed sense of pan-Africanism is visible through the popularity of African food, music like Afrobeats, and increased tourism from the Caribbean to African nations. On a governmental level, institutions like the African Export-Import Bank are working to boost trade, with leaders even proposing shared infrastructure like air bridges and a single digital currency to reduce barriers. This wave of African pride, amplified by social media, is seen as more economically focused and sustainable than previous movements.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship, capitalizing on a difficult final round for Scotland's Robert MacIntyre. MacIntyre, who started the day with a four-shot lead, struggled with a three-over-par 73, expressing immense frustration with his performance afterward. Scheffler's consistency and a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole were key to his three-under-par 67, which left him two shots clear to claim his 18th PGA Tour title. MacIntyre was left searching for answers after a round where he felt his shots were traveling unexpectedly long distances.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit will rise by 40 percent, driven by the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and revenue from technology licensing deals. This growth reflects a strategic shift for the company, moving away from generic drugs, which are expected to constitute a much smaller portion of its revenue in the coming years. The positive forecast highlights the growing strength of China's domestic pharmaceutical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the UK is in the midst of a leadership election that highlights a fundamental debate over its political strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bolder, "eco-populist" approach that directly confronts the wealthy elite and channels public anger, aiming to replace Labour as the primary party of the left. His opponents, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the successful grassroots strategy that led to a record four MPs in the last election. The contest forces the party to decide whether to stick with a proven method or adopt a more radical, anti-establishment tone.</p>

          <p>Jing Qian, a vice-president at the Asia Society, provides an analysis of the recent trade talks between the United States and China. He notes that the negotiations in London were framed as a continuation of earlier discussions in Geneva, where de-escalation was a primary goal for both nations amid market instability. The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, faced a team of veteran Chinese negotiators. The article suggests that these talks are part of an ongoing effort to manage what is described as a complex but potentially "manageable" rivalry between the two economic superpowers.</p>
