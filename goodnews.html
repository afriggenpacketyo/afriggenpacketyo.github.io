          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has suggested utilizing the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to establish temporary "Nightingale processing centres." This proposal aims to aggressively clear the nation's significant asylum application backlog and reduce the costly reliance on housing applicants in hotels. The plan involves doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions, which the party argues would be more humane for asylum seekers and fiscally responsible for taxpayers. This initiative is part of a broader party focus on law and order, presented at their annual conference.</p>

The session, which lasted two hours, was repeatedly halted due to crashes, including those involving championship contender Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments after the last restart, capitalizing on the chaotic conditions. The challenging session leaves McLaren's Lando Norris and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton starting further down the grid, setting up a competitive race.</p>

          <p>Kevin Blatt, a broker known for promoting celebrity sex tapes in the 2000s, states that his career has been rendered obsolete by subscription platforms like OnlyFans. He argues that such sites have shifted the power dynamic, allowing individuals to control and directly monetize their own explicit content, thus removing the market for leaked tapes. In a new docuseries, Blatt reflects on his past and the evolution of the industry, noting that privacy laws and creator-centric platforms have permanently altered the business model.

The couple, who had lived and run a charity in the country for decades, were released following negotiations brokered by Qatar. They were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London's Heathrow Airport. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never publicly disclosed the specific reason for their detention, a period during which their family expressed grave concerns for their health.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized a "golden share" right to prevent U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, a move that would have affected nearly 800 workers. This authority, which grants the White House veto power over major corporate decisions, was a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. After the Commerce Secretary warned against the closure, the company reversed its decision to idle the facility. This marks the first use of these national security-related powers, showcasing the administration's willingness to directly intervene in the private sector.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She discussed the profound cultural shifts regarding the media's treatment of women, the importance of the #MeToo movement, and her decision to reclaim her own story after realizing anonymity was impossible. Lewinsky emphasized that younger generations, unswayed by the political narrative of the time, were key to re-evaluating her situation through a lens of power dynamics. She now works to help others, like Amanda Knox, tell their own stories of surviving public shaming.</p>
