          <h2>Tripadvisor's 2024 Transparency Report Reveals Increase in Fake Review Detections</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. The company attributes this rise to an increase in submissions, along with a more stringent approach towards "incentivized reviews," where businesses offer rewards for favorable feedback. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged strategy to combat fake reviews, which includes auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, with 7% of submissions being auto-rejected. The article notes that paid reviews are considered a "more pernicious" category of fakes, often originating from Asia, and that rooting out fake reviews is a constant "cat and mouse" game, as Tripadvisor uses AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators.</p>

          <p>Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique is experiencing a resurgence in wildlife and human development after decades of war and poaching decimated its animal populations. American entrepreneur Greg Carr has dedicated himself to restoring the park, reintroducing animals and investing in the local communities. The park now employs 1,600 mostly Mozambican workers, supports 120 primary schools, and runs after-school clubs for young girls, with a focus on education and opportunity. The article explains that Carr aims to make the park self-sustaining through ecotourism and the sale of carbon credits, with revenues reinvested in the community, emphasizing his commitment to both the park's wildlife and its people.</p>

          <p>A mosaic that once decorated one of Roman Emperor Caligula's lavish party ships has been returned to Italy after being used as a coffee table in a New York City apartment for decades. The mosaic, made of rich green and white marble and purple-red porphyry, was part of an inlaid floor in one of the ships commissioned by Caligula, which were sunk in Lake Nemi after his assassination. The mosaic resurfaced in the 1960s when an art dealer, Helen Fioratti, purchased it and turned it into a coffee table, unaware of its origins. The article notes that prosecutors seized the mosaic in 2017 and returned it to the Italian government, and that a replica is being made for Fioratti.</p>

A luxury inn now acts as an economic engine, which has begun to change the character of the island.

          <p>Cleanup crews in California are tackling the aftermath of recent wildfires, dealing with toxic waste and the risk of exploding batteries from electric vehicles. The EPA cleared more than 9,000 properties in record time, but challenges remain, including the safe removal and disposal of lithium-ion batteries. The article explains that identifying and extracting batteries from incinerated EVs is complex, requiring specialized teams and equipment, and that the waste is transported to landfills in other states due to limited hazardous waste disposal options in California. Concerns persist among residents about the safety of air and soil, with some questioning the adequacy of removing only six inches of soil.</p>

The article explains that teams are self-funded, and the sport is on the rise, with increasing prize money and participation, offering a connection to the warriors of the past.
