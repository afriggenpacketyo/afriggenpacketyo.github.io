          <p>Donald Trump announced that he mediated a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia following recent deadly border clashes. After speaking with the leaders of both nations, he stated they agreed to meet immediately to work out a lasting peace agreement. Both countries publicly thanked Trump for his intervention, with Cambodia accepting the ceasefire request and Thailand emphasizing the need for dialogue first. Despite the diplomatic development, shelling reportedly continued along the border shortly after the calls were made, leaving the stability of the truce uncertain.</p>

Depp, a fellow member of the band The Hollywood Vampires with Cooper, played guitar on the Black Sabbath classic "Paranoid." The performance was a heartfelt tribute to Osbourne, the iconic Black Sabbath frontman who had passed away days earlier.

          <p>Despite the Dodgers taking an early 2-0 lead with first-inning home runs, Boston Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet settled down to lead his team to a 4-2 victory. Crochet struck out 10 batters over six innings, effectively shutting down the Dodgers' offense after the initial surge. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled, giving up four runs in under five innings, including a decisive three-run second inning. The game featured a pinch-hit appearance by Mookie Betts in his return to Fenway Park, but he struck out to end the game.</p>

The win prevents a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez. Kalinskaya will now face Fernandez, who won a marathon three-set thriller against Elena Rybakina, in the championship match as she seeks her first WTA 500 title.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been diagnosed with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ligament injury that could have ended his season. An MRI confirmed the strain, and Judge received a platelet-rich plasma injection before being placed on the injured list. The two-time MVP, who leads the major leagues in batting average, hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. The news comes as a relief to the team, which had feared a long-term absence for its star player.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering not only his music career but also his role as a pioneering reality television star. The MTV show "The Osbournes," which ran from 2002 to 2005, offered an unfiltered look into the daily life of the heavy metal legend and his family. The series blended mundane family situations with rock-star fame, creating a "reality sitcom" format that predated shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians."

The body's stress response, driven by hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, can cause an increased heart rate and anxiety. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting enough rest, having a clear plan for the day, and engaging in movement to release nervous energy.

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with July's average temperature running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. This has resulted in persistent cloud cover and drizzle, a stark contrast to the extreme heat seen in other parts of California. While some residents enjoy the temperate weather, the pattern is a notable deviation from typical summer conditions.</p>
