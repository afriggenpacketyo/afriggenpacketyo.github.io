          <h2>Health Experts Evaluate the Efficacy of Vibration Plates for Weight Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 05:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent fitness trend involving vibration plates, popularized on social media, is being examined for its weight loss benefits. While fitness trainers acknowledge these devices can improve muscle activation, strength, and coordination, they caution that the plates are not a substitute for traditional exercise and a healthy diet. Experts like Nic Wilson and institutions such as the Mayo Clinic note that while some studies suggest benefits like improved bone density, comprehensive research is lacking. The machines do not burn a significant amount of calories on their own, and individuals with certain medical conditions should consult a doctor before use.</p>

          <p>A significant portion, 39.1%, of Warren Buffett's $291 billion Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is concentrated in three companies heavily involved with artificial intelligence: Apple, American Express, and Amazon. Despite his traditional investment style, Buffett has embraced the AI sector, with Apple representing the largest holding, integrating AI into its core products. American Express utilizes AI and machine learning for complex banking operations like credit decisions and fraud prevention, while Amazon leverages it extensively through its AWS cloud services. The article notes that while these stocks face challenges like tariffs, their long-term AI integration positions them for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Astronomers Witness Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb and ALMA telescopes, astronomers have captured the first-ever direct evidence of rocky planet formation around a nascent, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Located 1,370 light-years away, the infant star's surrounding gas disk shows signs of silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing, the fundamental building blocks of terrestrial planets like Earth. This discovery provides an unprecedented look into a process that occurred in our own solar system over 4.5 billion years ago. The observation suggests that the initial steps of planet formation may be a common cosmic event, offering new insights into the potential prevalence of Earth-like worlds.</p>

          <p>An article from The Motley Fool identifies Universal Health Realty Income Trust (UHT) as a potentially attractive investment for those seeking high dividend yields. The healthcare-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) currently offers a 7.4% yield, which is noted as being historically high for the stock. The piece highlights the company's four-decade history of annual dividend increases, presenting it as a reliable, albeit slow-growing, option for income-focused investors. However, it also points out potential conflicts of interest due to its external management structure, suggesting it may not be suitable for all investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a new target to reduce the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This pledge is the first specific target set by ministers on the issue, following significant public anger over record-high pollution incidents in England's waterways. The announcement comes ahead of a major review of the water industry and includes further plans to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and cut phosphorus pollution. Critics, while welcoming the goal, have pointed out that the pledge is not legally binding and have questioned how the government will be held accountable.</p>

          <p>In a notable case blending crime with modern technology, a Wisconsin man was cleared of murder charges thanks to data from his Fitbit. Doug Detrie was the initial suspect in the 2016 death of his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, but his activity tracker corroborated his alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Steven Burch, as a suspect. Further technological evidence from Burch's phone, using Google Dashboard, placed him at the key locations related to the crime, leading to his arrest and eventual conviction for the murder.</p>
