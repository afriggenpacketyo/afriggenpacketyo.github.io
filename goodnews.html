          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to new Sportico rankings. This represents a remarkable financial turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was last in the league with a valuation of $930 million. The franchise's growth is largely attributed to its return to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium, which has significantly boosted revenue and brand profile.

          <p>The 27th season of Comedy Central's "South Park" is achieving its highest ratings in years, with viewership surging nearly 50% between its first and second episodes. This success is largely attributed to the show's unflinching satirical takes on political figures, including President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The ratings spike comes amid tensions between parent company Paramount and the Trump administration, and follows a massive new streaming deal for the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks rallied significantly, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, as investors grow more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This optimism for lower borrowing costs, which disproportionately benefit smaller companies, contrasted with a slight decline in the tech-heavy Magnificent 7 Index. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, following weaker jobs data and a cooler-than-expected inflation report, which could boost economic activity.
