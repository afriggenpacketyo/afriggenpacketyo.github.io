          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a dramatic qualifying session, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri on his final lap. Piastri will start second, with his teammate Lando Norris securing third, creating an exciting prospect for the race. Mercedes' George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finished fourth and fifth, respectively, setting up a competitive grid. Verstappen noted the challenging windy conditions and the team's low-downforce setup made the high-speed corners at Silverstone particularly demanding, but ultimately proved successful.</p>

          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in more situations than ever before, causing confusion and frustration. Point-of-sale touch screens often present pre-calculated tip options of 15%, 20%, or 25%, even for counter service or takeout. Marketing professors note that while this technology was widely adopted during the pandemic, many businesses have not opted out of the embedded tip requests. This design pressures customers into tipping, often out of social obligation or guilt, changing long-standing cultural norms around gratuities.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations on the framework's implementation, a development President Trump called "very positive." The proposal, announced by Trump earlier in the week, has Israeli cabinet support but awaits formal commitment. Hamas is reportedly seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the truce, signaling potential progress in the nearly 21-month-long conflict that has devastated the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a formidable challenge in the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into what experts are calling the tournament's "toughest group." Group D also includes powerhouse teams France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four nations are ranked in the world's top 11. England enters as the defending champion, while the Netherlands won the 2017 tournament. Despite being the lowest-ranked team, Wales has shown competitive form, while France arrives with an impressive winning streak, setting the stage for highly competitive and unpredictable opening matches.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as the "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink made with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, claims to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone and that doctors rarely aim to lower it except in specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, its ingredients are not proven to reduce stress or cortisol levels in the body.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s has been discovered, exciting scholars who see it as a key part of the origin story of modern Chinese computing. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang and dubbed the "MingKwai," the machine ingeniously solved the challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters by breaking them down by shape rather than sound. This concept of predictive input based on component shapes underlies the technology used today to type Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The restored machine is now housed at Stanford University.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Parisians are legally swimming in the Seine River after a swimming ban enacted in 1923 was officially lifted. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, tied to last year's Olympics, which has significantly improved water quality. Designated swimming areas have been established with strict safety measures, including lifeguards and floating buoys.

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their crucial role in marine ecosystems. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team researches sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet and the overall health of the bay. Researchers explain that a healthy shark population is an indicator of a healthy ocean. Despite the public's fascination with sharks, the scientists note that securing financial support for their vital research remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for living a more fulfilled life. Based on neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's findings, the rule posits that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, individuals can choose not to re-engage the thought that caused the emotion, preventing a cycle of negativity. Gawdat suggests that by allowing the initial feeling to pass and then consciously shifting focus, people can more quickly recover from life's daily upsets and build emotional resilience.</p>

The experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and build confidence. She found that having hobbies forced her to set better boundaries between work and personal life, fostering genuine balance. The article argues that instead of waiting for balance to appear, actively pursuing hobbies is the secret to creating a more joyful and well-rounded existence.</p>

The state's appeal lies in its sunny weather and tax-friendly policies, including no state income, estate, or inheritance tax. In contrast, states like California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of over 56,000. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the importance of decoupling exercise from the singular goal of weight loss, a mindset that can be counterproductive for long-term health and well-being. For many, the association between working out and getting thin can create a negative relationship with physical activity. The piece highlights that finding a form of movement that is enjoyable and empowering, such as weight lifting or group fitness, can be more beneficial. Shifting the focus to how movement makes one feel, rather than how it makes one look, can lead to a more sustainable and positive approach to physical fitness.</p>
