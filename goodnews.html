          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down on October 1. This is because the benefits are classified as mandatory spending, which Congress has already approved without an expiration date. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires annual approval, and a shutdown could disrupt other services like benefit verifications, earnings corrections, and Medicare card replacements as some staff are furloughed. The agency's contingency plan indicates that nearly 90% of its workforce would remain on the job.</p>

          <p>Brandon Stanton, the creator of the popular photography project "Humans of New York," has opened up about his personal history, including a past battle with Adderall addiction that led to him flunking out of college. After getting clean and later being fired from a finance job, Stanton found a new sense of purpose by picking up a camera, which eventually led to his ambitious project to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers. His work has since evolved into a massive platform for connection and philanthropy, raising over $20 million for various causes and individuals featured in his stories. His upcoming book, "Dear New York," will donate all proceeds to charity.</p>

          <p>Following their 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup, European players celebrated by playfully taunting former President Donald Trump, who is an avid golf fan and was present at the event. The team was recorded singing "Are you watching Donald Trump?" after Rory McIlroy received a text from him. Trump responded good-naturedly on social media, congratulating the team on their win. The celebration continued on the team bus, with Shane Lowry leading chants, echoing the spirited festivities from their previous victory in Rome two years prior and highlighting the camaraderie among the European players.</p>

The service is initially available for items from U.S. Etsy sellers, with plans to integrate over one million Shopify merchants, including major brands like Skims and Glossier, in the near future. This move into e-commerce could create a significant new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will collect a transaction fee from merchants for sales completed through the platform. The underlying technology, developed with Stripe, aims to streamline the shopping experience by allowing users to complete purchases without leaving their conversations.</p>

          <p>AI startup Anthropic has launched its latest model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, which it claims is the "best coding model in the world" according to industry benchmarks. The new model is designed to be more intelligent and collaborative, excelling at practical business tasks and specialized fields like finance and cybersecurity. Despite being smaller than its predecessor, Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4.5 is described as smarter and more capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks autonomously for up to 30 hours. Anthropic also highlighted significant safety improvements, including reduced instances of deceptive or sycophantic behavior and greater resistance to malicious prompt injections.</p>

          <p>According to behavioral scientists, a simple two-step plan can significantly improve the likelihood of achieving financial goals: set a specific goal and then create a reminder to take action. This approach helps bridge the gap between intention and execution, a common hurdle for many savers. While manual reminders like calendar alerts can be effective, experts suggest that automating savings deposits generally yields better results. The article also highlights that people are most motivated to set new goals during "fresh starts," such as the beginning of a new year, a new week, or after a birthday, as these moments provide a psychological boost in optimism.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Tuesday. However, its current trajectory shows it moving away from the southeastern United States and toward Bermuda. As of Monday, the storm was bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the northwestern Bahamas, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. While a direct U.S. landfall is not expected, swells generated by Imelda are predicted to affect much of the East Coast, creating potentially life-threatening surf and rip current conditions throughout the early part of the week.</p>

This expansion of services follows eToro's public listing on the Nasdaq exchange earlier this year. The move reflects a broader trend among crypto platforms to offer staking rewards as a way to attract and retain users in the competitive digital asset market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a homeowner with a $300,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,824. This represents a significant saving compared to earlier this year when rates were higher; for instance, it is about $180 less per month than the payment would have been in January when rates averaged 7.04%. The lower rates have spurred an increase in both new mortgage applications and refinancing activity as borrowers look to capitalize on the reduced costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, where he is expected to push for acceptance of a new U.S.-backed plan to end the war in Gaza. The proposal, shared with regional partners, reportedly includes an end to the conflict, a surge in humanitarian aid, and the release of remaining Israeli hostages by Hamas within 48 hours. The high-stakes meeting comes as the two-year anniversary of the October 7th attack approaches and as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with the prolonged conflict and its rising death toll.</p>
