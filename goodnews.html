          <h2>Sir David Attenborough's New Ocean Film Delivers Stark Message on Marine Conservation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir David Attenborough, ahead of his 99th birthday, is releasing a cinema-length film titled Ocean, which he believes is crucial for saving biodiversity and combating climate change. The film highlights the catastrophic decline in ocean life since Attenborough's first scuba dive in 1957 and showcases the destructive impact of bottom trawling, a fishing practice that releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Attenborough emphasizes that the ocean can recover faster than imagined, citing the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling. He hopes the film will inspire leaders to take action at an upcoming UN conference to protect a third of the world's oceans, enabling the ocean to thrive and trap more carbon dioxide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" after Trump romanticized the idea of the U.S. acquiring Canada. Carney used real estate terms to convey Canada's position, drawing a parallel to places like Buckingham Palace that are not for sale. Despite Carney's rejection, Trump insisted that trade and other negotiations would not be affected, though he did not completely dismiss the idea of acquiring Canada. Carney later revealed that he asked Trump to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state, highlighting tensions in trade and border relations.</p>

          <p>California Democratic lawmakers have struck a deal on legislation to increase penalties for soliciting a minor aged 16 or 17, after facing criticism and a rebuke from Governor Gavin Newsom. The amended bill allows prosecutors to file felony charges against adults who solicit sex from a 16- or 17-year-old if the accused is three years older than the minor, while those within three years face misdemeanor charges. The bill will also include a state grant program to streamline prosecution in human trafficking and sexual assault cases and a support fund for survivors.</p>

Despite Trump's pre-meeting attacks on Canada, the meeting was more cordial, though the underlying issues remain unresolved.
