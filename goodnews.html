          <p>England wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso is set to make his comeback against a France XV on Saturday after a six-month absence due to a dislocated shoulder sustained in December. Bath flankers Ted Hill and Guy Pepper will also start, following their contributions to Bath's Premiership final victory over Leicester. Joe Carpenter will play at full-back, and Seb Atkinson will be at 12, both awaiting their first cap, though the match isn't classified as a Test. George Ford and Jamie George will co-captain the side, while Alex Coles earns a spot in the second row after last appearing for England last summer.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 09:14:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say high-yield savings accounts can still be worthwhile in the current economic climate, offering considerably better returns than traditional savings accounts. They are particularly useful for short-term financial goals and emergency funds, providing safety and liquidity. While interest rates on these accounts fluctuate with the Federal Reserve's rate, they remain competitive, with some still offering rates of 4% or higher. However, these accounts should not replace long-term investments like stocks, which offer higher potential growth, and certificates of deposit (CDs) may be considered as an alternative for short-term savings, though they require funds to be locked up for a set term (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Retirement Experts Highlight Annuity Mistakes Seniors Should Avoid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 09:10:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirement experts caution seniors to carefully consider annuities, as economic uncertainties heighten concerns about retirement security. Common mistakes include not understanding fees, such as surrender charges and withdrawal penalties, and choosing the wrong type of annuity for their needs. Immediate annuities are best for guaranteed income now, while indexed annuities offer growth with downside protection, and fixed annuities suit those wanting predictable, conservative growth. Failing to designate a beneficiary can prevent benefits from passing to loved ones, and withdrawing excessive funds early can trigger fees and reduce future income (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has maintained UK interest rates at 4.25% but suggested potential cuts as early as August. Inflation remains above the Bank's target rate, and Governor Andrew Bailey cited concerns over the conflict between Israel and Iran impacting energy costs. The Bank is closely monitoring events in the Middle East and their potential effect on oil prices, which have already risen significantly. Despite marginally improved expectations for the UK economy, underlying growth is considered weak, with signs of softening in the labor market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Florida Panthers have cracked and dented the Stanley Cup during their celebration of winning back-to-back championships. The bowl of the trophy is cracked, and the bottom is dented, which is not unusual for the 131-year-old cup. The Hockey Hall of Fame said that it is taking the appropriate steps and plan to have it repaired by the celebration parade on Sunday. Made of silver and a nickel alloy, the 37-pound Cup is relatively malleable and damage is nothing new for the trophy.</p>

          <p>An additional 2.7 million households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification about property size, type, and home energy score is being scrapped, benefiting almost a million households with children. The cost of expanding the Warm Home Discount will be covered by energy companies and could potentially be passed on through the standing charge, though the government says any rise will be offset by savings made by cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt. Debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move.</p>
