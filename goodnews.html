          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong revenue growth of 420% in its first earnings report since its IPO, surpassing analyst expectations with $981.6 million in revenue compared to the anticipated $853 million. Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation, the company's revenue backlog increased by 63%. CEO Mike Intrator acknowledged uncertainties in global trade policy but highlighted accelerating customer demand, especially noting a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion, which complements OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft. CoreWeave's growth hinges on securing sufficient power for its data centers, with the company adding 300 megawatts of contracted power during the quarter, bringing its total to 1.3 gigawatts.</p>

He allegedly provided ammunition and magazines, surveilled the base with a drone, and instructed the officers on how to enter the facility and which building to target. Said was arrested near the base on the scheduled day of the attack and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has moved the Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) staff from the CIA to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in an effort to streamline operations and ensure a continuity of workforce. The PDB, a daily summary of high-level national security information for the president, has always been coordinated and delivered by the ODNI with contributions from the CIA. This move follows Gabbard's earlier transfer of the National Intelligence Council from the CIA to ODNI, both aimed at providing the President with more timely and actionable intelligence.

          <p>Uber is launching a new "Route Share" feature, designed to resemble public transportation, offering commuters a lower-cost alternative by operating Uber shuttles along busy routes with pickups every 20 minutes. The service, available during weekday commuting hours, allows passengers to share rides with up to two other people at half the cost of an UberX. Uber is also introducing "Price Lock," a feature that lets customers choose a fixed price for a specific route for $2.99 per month, potentially saving up to $50 a month. This caters to riders in densely populated areas and expands on existing shared car services, aiming to make Uber more accessible for regular commuters without access to a car or transit stops.</p>

This comes as the U.S. faces a rise in measles cases, with the majority of infections occurring in an outbreak in West Texas.

This decision comes as the company's streaming business has improved profitability and added millions of subscribers, despite losing rights to NBA games.

          <p>Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee have advanced a bill that includes a provision to eliminate federal income tax on money earned from tips, fulfilling a campaign promise by President Donald Trump. The proposed law would create an above-the-line deduction for tips received by individuals in occupations that traditionally receive tips, phasing out for those making over $160,000 a year and expiring after 2028. The bill's provisions are expected to change as it moves through the legislative process, with potential restrictions such as a maximum deduction of $25,000.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current interest rate environment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a significantly cheaper borrowing option compared to personal loans. The average HELOC rate is 7.99%, while the average personal loan rate is 12.47%. HELOCs are secured by the borrower's home, resulting in lower interest rates, and they often have variable interest rates that are likely to decrease further due to anticipated rate cuts. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by choosing a HELOC over a personal loan, making it a more financially advantageous option for those who can manage their payments responsibly.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reviving a plan to set drug price caps based on amounts paid in other high-income countries, a concept previously considered but ultimately rejected by Senate Democrats and the Biden administration. Trump's executive order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop regulations imposing these price restrictions if drugmakers don't voluntarily lower U.S. prices. While Democrats had initially explored a similar approach, concerns over innovation and support from moderate senators led them to adopt a different formula for capping drug prices. Trump officials argue they have the authority to pursue these wider actions to lower drug prices, despite legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Burberry is implementing a new cost-savings plan to save 100 million pounds by fiscal 2027, potentially eliminating 20% of its workforce, as CEO Josh Schulman aims to rebuild sales and margins. Despite a 17% revenue drop in fiscal 2025, Schulman is focusing on operational improvements and product scarcity to drive desirability. Designer Daniel Lee remains committed as chief creative officer, and the company is investing in its manufacturing heritage in the UK. The market responded positively to the strategy, with Burberry shares soaring nearly 16%.</p>
