        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson is set to join German champions Bayern Munich on a loan deal that includes an option for a permanent transfer. The initial loan will cost Bayern £13 million, with a subsequent purchase option valued at £56.2 million. The 24-year-old Senegal international has reportedly already agreed to a pre-contract with the club and has been given permission to travel to Germany. Jackson's opportunities at Chelsea became limited following the arrival of new summer signings, prompting the move to seek more consistent playing time.</p>

          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online, exemplified by new legislation like the UK's Online Safety Act, is driving a surge in AI-powered safety technology. These regulations compel tech companies to shield minors from harmful content, leading to the adoption of advanced age-verification systems by platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X. Companies such as Yoti are developing AI that estimates age from facial features, while phone manufacturers are creating child-safe devices with built-in content filters. This trend marks a significant shift as tech giants face increasing pressure to prioritize child safety over previous business models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a difficult contract stalemate with the Dallas Cowboys, star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded to the Green Bay Packers. In exchange, the Packers sent two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas, while signing Parsons to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons expressed his excitement about joining a historic franchise and aims to build a legacy similar to Packers legends like Reggie White. The move provides Green Bay with a much-needed elite pass rusher as they build on recent playoff appearances.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This surge has made North Korea the second-largest volume buyer of Chinese bottled wine, trailing only Hong Kong. Despite extensive international sanctions on luxury goods, alcohol is not on the United Nations' restricted list for the country. As one of the world's most isolated nations, North Korea has few alternative sources for alcoholic beverages, solidifying China's role as a key supplier.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men under the age of 22 to leave the country, a change from the previous ban on men aged 18 to 60. The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and work abroad, hoping they will use their experience to aid in the nation's future development. Previously, many young men were leaving before their 18th birthday due to fears of being drafted for the war against Russia. However, some demographers express concern that this policy may exacerbate brain drain rather than encourage a return to the country.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match. Despite appearing to struggle with a lower back issue early on and taking a medical timeout, the 38-year-old Serbian star rallied to secure a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 victory. This win makes Djokovic the oldest man to reach the last 16 at the US Open since Jimmy Connors in 1991 and ties Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam fourth-round appearances. Norrie played aggressively, winning the second set, but was ultimately outmatched by Djokovic's resilience and powerful serving.</p>
