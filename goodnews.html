          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed he held a 'very productive' phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, encouraging him to apply his diplomatic efforts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. Citing recent breakthroughs in other regions, Zelenskyy expressed hope that a similar resolution could be achieved to end the ongoing war with Russia. The conversation also addressed Ukraine's urgent need for enhanced air defense systems following a major Russian airstrike on its power grid, with Zelenskyy noting Trump's willingness to provide support. This call marks a notable improvement in the relationship between the two leaders, who previously had a publicly strained dynamic.</p>

Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental in the win, scoring a magnificent 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings. In response, Sri Lanka's batting lineup struggled against a formidable English bowling attack led by Sophie Ecclestone, who took four wickets for just 17 runs. Despite a promising start, Sri Lanka was all out for 164, securing England's third consecutive win and placing them at the top of the tournament standings.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London last year, has been officially retired to a sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. The 15-year-old horse sustained a broken bone and significant bleeding after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise in April 2024. The chaotic incident saw the horses collide with vehicles and resulted in injuries to five soldiers and four civilians. After extensive veterinary care, it was determined that Quaker could not return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and would live out his retirement at The Horse Trust.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson led the Las Vegas Aces to their third WNBA title in four years, capping a season of unprecedented individual achievement. Wilson became the first player in WNBA or NBA history to win the scoring title, Most Valuable Player, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP in the same season. The team's path to the championship was challenging, overcoming a mid-season slump and injuries before a 16-game winning streak secured their playoff position. Wilson's dominance on both offense and defense, including a game-winning shot in Game 3, has solidified her place in the conversation for the greatest player in the league's history.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has achieved a level of market dominance that is creating unprecedented challenges and opportunities for tech startups and investors in Silicon Valley. The privately held AI giant is investing aggressively across the entire tech stack, from data center infrastructure with partners like Nvidia to consumer applications like its Sora video app. This rapid expansion is forcing venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to seek niche markets not yet targeted by OpenAI. The company's immense capital and swift product rollouts are accelerating the pace of innovation and disruption, making it difficult to predict the future competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have formally backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan stipulates that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election, it will consider this a mandate to negotiate another vote on Scottish independence. Swinney successfully argued this was the most realistic path, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. An alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum if pro-independence parties win over 50% of the vote was rejected by the party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of consumers, particularly from Gen Z, are rejecting mass-produced 'fast furniture' in favor of secondhand items, driven by sustainability concerns and a desire for unique pieces with history. This trend pushes back against an industry that contributes over 51 million tons of consumed furniture annually, with the vast majority ending up in landfills. The rise of cheap, disposable decor has been linked to increased pressure on natural resources, such as ancient forests. Online platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest have seen a surge in searches for used furniture, reflecting a shift towards more environmentally conscious and personal home decorating.</p>

          <p>A potential peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which would end the war in Gaza, is being largely credited to the diplomatic pressure exerted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Political analysts suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long built his career on understanding American politics, recognized the shifting U.S. sentiment and the critical need for American support. Consequently, when Trump pushed for a deal, Netanyahu was compelled to act, leading to a turning point in the conflict. The development underscores the significant influence the U.S. presidency holds in navigating and resolving complex Middle Eastern conflicts.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock, investors are increasingly moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds and opting for more targeted investments in themes like artificial intelligence and blockchain. The firm's U.S. head of equity ETFs noted a significant trend of capital flowing into specific AI-focused ETFs, which offer exposure to the entire AI ecosystem from semiconductors to large language models. Similarly, enthusiasm around blockchain technology, particularly Ethereum, is driving interest in related funds. This shift indicates a desire for more granular exposure to potentially disruptive technologies rather than general Big Tech holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.N. established the day to serve as a 'rallying cry' to recognize the voices and limitless potential of girls.
