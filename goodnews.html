          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit where a Gaza peace plan is expected to be signed, co-chaired by US President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Downing Street claimed the UK played a key role in shaping the plan, an assertion disputed by US ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israeli deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel, who criticized the UK's stance on Palestinian statehood. Starmer plans to thank mediators and offer continued UK support for the truce and humanitarian aid, but faces domestic criticism for attending while pressing issues remain.</p>

After a first-round exit on debut last year, Littler showed ruthless form, winning five of his six sets in final-leg deciders to secure the £120,000 prize money. This victory marks his seventh PDC major televised title, elevating him to joint seventh-highest in history and significantly closing the gap on Humphries for the world number one spot ahead of December's World Championships.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, has initiated a bid to acquire rival Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that could dramatically reshape the Hollywood landscape. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial offer of approximately $20 a share, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. The potential merger would consolidate major media assets, including HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. studios, aiming to enhance competitiveness against tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. This strategic play by Paramount is seen as an attempt to acquire more content before Warner Bros. Discovery's planned asset division next April.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met, agreeing that the two Asian powers should be "partners" rather than "rivals," marking a potential shift in global order. Modi stressed the need for strategic autonomy and a commitment to resolving border disputes, while inviting Xi to next year's BRICS summit in India. Both leaders envision Sino-Indian ties as crucial for a multipolar order and an "Asian century," with direct flights set to resume after five years. This diplomatic overture by India appears to be a strategic move to reset historically tense relations and forge a coalition of eastern powers.</p>

Cross, 37, expressed speechlessness at his unexpected victory, attributing it to "force and accuracy" and a bit of chance. The event also saw the disqualification of one individual attempting to bring in their own conker, reinforcing the organizers' commitment to fair play in this quirky tradition.</p>

          <p>The northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein has formalized an agreement allowing Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays: the first day of Ramadan and the first day of Eid al-Adha. This move, while sparking public debate and misinterpretations of "extra holidays," merely formalizes a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom. Legal scholars dismiss the uproar, stating it aligns with existing laws that permit special leave for religious observance across various faiths. The initiative reflects Germany's ongoing national conversation about integration and cultural identity, adapting to evolving religious demographics.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's star batter, Kane Williamson, will miss the upcoming T20 series against England due to injury, having been sidelined from international cricket since the Champions Trophy final in March. Despite this setback, captain Mitchell Santner returns from abdominal surgery to lead the Black Caps, and all-rounder Rachin Ravindra is also back after recovering from a facial injury. Williamson is, however, expected to return for the subsequent three one-day internationals against England, providing hope for his participation in the longer format. The three-match T20 series is set to commence in Christchurch on Saturday, 18 October, with New Zealand facing England without one of their key players for this specific format.</p>
