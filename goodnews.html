          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 14-11 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks with a three-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Ohtani's decisive hit capped off a six-run inning for the Dodgers, completing a 3-for-6, four-RBI performance. The game was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading leads and showcasing explosive offense. Roki Sasaki, making his second MLB start, had a shaky outing, while the Dodgers' offense ultimately secured the win with their late-game heroics. Ohtani expressed his excitement for the game, calling it a great game.</p>

          <p>Arab countries are focusing on bolstering economic ties with the U.S., particularly in defense, AI, and advanced weaponry, despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE have pledged significant investments in the U.S. ahead of President Trump's visit, with Riyadh offering $600 billion in trade and investment over four years. While a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal is currently unlikely due to the Palestinian issue, discussions regarding a Saudi civil nuclear program and defense cooperation are progressing independently. Analysts speculate that Trump's "very big announcement" during his trip could relate to the Hamas hostages, a potential US-Iran nuclear deal, or the situation with Yemen's Houthis.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a malfunction, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact time and location remain uncertain. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus's atmosphere, has a good chance of surviving its descent through Earth's atmosphere, potentially reaching the surface partially intact. While the re-entry poses minimal risk to people on the ground, recovered pieces of the spacecraft legally belong to Russia.</p>

Vaughan says the case has significantly impacted her life, causing stress and disruption. The FA has confirmed the closure of the disciplinary case but has not issued an apology.</p>

Google's policy is to follow the U.S. government's lead on official names, but Mexico argues that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the part over the U.S. continental shelf.

Tougher English language requirements for immigrants and new rules on the recruitment of international care workers are also likely to be highlighted.

          <p>As U.S. tariffs cripple trade with China, Chinese companies are increasingly relocating manufacturing operations to Vietnam. Factories producing goods ranging from jeans to Christmas wreaths are rapidly establishing or expanding operations in Vietnam to circumvent the tariffs. E-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein are facilitating this shift, helping businesses find manufacturing alternatives in Vietnam. The move reflects a broader trend of Chinese companies seeking to maintain access to the U.S. market by utilizing alternative manufacturing locations.</p>
