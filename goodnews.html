          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national and student at the University of Michigan, has fled the United States after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus, leading to charges of unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. The FBI has charged Gao with flight to avoid prosecution, although the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. Studies indicate that instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections are rare. </p>
