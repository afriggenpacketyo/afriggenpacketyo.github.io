          <p>Ashley Kaye, a 36-year-old, sold her childhood home to travel the world full-time in a Toyota Tacoma truck. Inspired by a chance encounter and the desire for adventure, Kaye spent over $50,000 renovating her truck for overlanding, a form of self-reliant travel to remote destinations. Since 2023, she has journeyed through Mexico, Central America, and South America, embracing a life with no fixed plans and a deep appreciation for the freedom to explore. Kaye's primary takeaway from her travels is that life is too short, encouraging others to pursue their dreams without hesitation.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative," marking the 48th blood group system recognized worldwide. The discovery occurred 15 years after the woman's blood sample was collected for routine surgery tests, and the unusual antibody was detected in 2011. High-throughput DNA sequencing in 2019 revealed a genetic mutation, making the woman the only known carrier compatible with herself. Researchers hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper's aspirations of winning the Queen's Club Championships were dashed as he was defeated by Jiri Lehecka in a semi-final match, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. Draper, who had been feeling unwell with tonsillitis, displayed resilience by taking the second set after losing the first, but ultimately succumbed to Lehecka's crucial break in the third. Despite the setback, Draper expressed his determination to compete, stating he "wouldn't have pulled out for anything" given his desire to reach the final on home soil. He will now rest before preparing for Wimbledon, which begins on June 30.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts are raising concerns about the effectiveness of US sunscreens compared to those available in other countries. While American sunscreens generally provide good protection against UVB rays, they often offer weaker protection against UVA rays due to regulatory differences. The FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years, while countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients. Dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>Eight women posed for photographer Miora Rajaonary for a project to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a disease that afflicts an estimated 56 million women and girls, mainly in Africa. The waterborne infection is spread by parasitic worms and is found particularly in areas with limited access to clean water and health care. The women wear traditional Malagasy face masks and are photographed against a backdrop representing water, symbolizing both the source of the disease and their connection to it. The women's stories and courage are highlighted in the exhibit Sahy Rano, currently on display at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. The ruling is a victory for civil liberties groups who argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state. The court's decision backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
