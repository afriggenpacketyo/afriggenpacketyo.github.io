          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-cutting measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation is a response to declining letter volumes and rising operational costs. While second-class delivery targets are being slightly relaxed, Royal Mail must continue its six-day-a-week service for first-class mail. The changes aim to ensure the financial sustainability of the postal service while introducing new targets to minimize significant delivery delays for all mail types.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued without any visible injuries after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Clearwater Project, a new seven-mile-long wastewater outfall tunnel. The workers were able to navigate over a large pile of debris to a safe area before being evacuated. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, facilitated the complex rescue operation from deep underground.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a global safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and stable macroeconomic fundamentals. The assertion, made in a recent article, points to the yuan's resilience during recent periods of global stress, such as the war in Ukraine and shocks from US tariffs. To achieve this status, the authors call for more flexible capital controls and greater efforts to increase foreign participation in China's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for weight-loss medication in China is rapidly expanding, mirroring a trend seen in Western countries and now estimated to be worth around US$150 billion. This growth is fueled by the approval of new, more effective drugs and rising obesity rates. Innovent Biologics, a domestic firm, was the first to receive approval to market its weight-loss drug within the country. The article notes that dozens of other producers are now vying for a share of this lucrative and nascent pharmaceutical sector in China.</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful housing policies, which are anchored by a large and stable social housing sector. This sector comprises about 43% of the city's housing units and serves a wide range of income levels, keeping rent significantly lower than in the private market and helping to moderate private rents as well. Originating in the 1920s, the system is funded by a levy on employee salaries and has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities. While access can be complex, the model demonstrates how long-term political commitment can prioritize housing as a basic need.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created what they claim is the world's first cyborg bee, controlled by the lightest-ever insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is attached to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the cyborg bee reportedly obeyed the remote commands with 90% accuracy.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players, including Wimbledon semi-finalist Amanda Anisimova, are increasingly speaking out about the importance of managing mental health and preventing burnout in their demanding sport. Anisimova took a months-long break from tennis to recover, a decision she says was essential for her well-being and current success. Other stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Andrey Rublev also discussed the psychological pressures of the tour, the need to find joy outside of results, and the strategies they use, from therapy to taking personal time, to maintain their mental equilibrium.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in 2023, has been installed as a permanent memorial at a visitor center in Northumberland. The display allows the public to see and touch the trunk, which is now surrounded by benches inscribed with messages from people who cherished the tree. The design was developed after a public consultation to determine how best to honor its memory. The installation aims to transform an act of vandalism into a symbol of hope and a renewed commitment to nature.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat persistent youth unemployment, the Chinese government has announced a new one-off subsidy for companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers who provide formal contracts and pay social insurance contributions can receive up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This measure is part of a broader push to stabilize the labor market amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. The government is also expanding its "work-for-relief" program, which funds labor-intensive public works projects to create jobs for vulnerable groups.</p>

WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles and significant debt, while Ferrero has been actively expanding its portfolio by acquiring other major food brands in recent years.

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, opting to hold steady as it evaluates the impact of recent government measures aimed at cooling down Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% year-over-year in June, prompting concerns about rapidly expanding household debt. While the broader economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability. Analysts expect that if the housing measures prove effective, the bank may be open to cutting rates later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans that were sickened by a toxic algal bloom off the Southern California coast have been successfully treated and released back into the wild. The birds were among nearly 200 seabirds rescued by the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center after being poisoned by domoic acid. This year's bloom was the most severe and deadly in the region since 2015, also affecting numerous sea lions. The public release of the recovered pelicans in Huntington Beach served as a hopeful reminder of the importance of wildlife rehabilitation efforts.</p>
