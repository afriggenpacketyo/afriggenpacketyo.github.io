          <p>Due to increasing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, affluent Chinese investors are diverting their capital away from the U.S. real estate market. In 2024, Thailand, Australia, and Canada emerged as the preferred destinations for Chinese buyers seeking homes priced above US$5 million. This shift marks a significant change from 2023, when the U.S. was the top choice. Factors such as geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals have contributed to this trend, leading Chinese investors to seek friendlier alternatives.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds for private school tuition, home-schooling, and virtual learning programs, with families receiving $10,000 per year and children with disabilities qualifying for up to $30,000. While supporters argue it will provide more options for students in underperforming public schools, critics contend that it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthy families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could cost up to $4.5 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has outlawed Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a mere "commercial transaction" that undermines EU solidarity. The ruling vindicates anti-corruption efforts and clarifies that citizenship is more than just a financial commitment. While purchased passports are now prohibited, "golden visas," which offer residency permits for real estate investments, remain a viable option for accessing the Schengen zone. Concerns persist regarding the risks of money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption associated with these schemes, prompting calls for stricter EU-level enforcement.</p>
