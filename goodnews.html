          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a larger number of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom for a 2028 presidential run compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom maintains a positive overall approval rating in his home state, voters are more divided on whether he should pursue the presidency. The survey also explored Californians' perceptions of their state as a national model, finding positive views on technology and culture but negative opinions on housing and economic policy.</p>

          <p>With an unprecedented concentration of market value in a few mega-cap tech stocks, investors are increasingly seeking uncorrelated assets to hedge their portfolios. ETF flow data shows a significant move into cash, precious metals like gold, and cryptocurrencies to mitigate risk. While allocations are still relatively small, this trend suggests a shift away from traditional stock-heavy strategies toward a more diversified approach in response to the market's current imbalance and perceived volatility.

          <p>President Donald Trump has backed away from a plan to "surge" federal forces into San Francisco to address crime after receiving phone calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump noted that he also spoke with Mayor Daniel Lurie and was convinced that the city was making "substantial progress" on its own. The reversal is seen as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has advocated for local control over a military-style deployment.</p>
