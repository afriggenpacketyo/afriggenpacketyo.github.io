          <p>The Boston Red Sox have reported concerns about doxxing to the Newton Police Department after trading Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants. Newton Police confirmed they were notified by representatives from the Red Sox organization but are not investigating any online threats. The trade follows the Red Sox signing of Alex Bregman and Devers' refusal to play first base, indicating friction within the clubhouse. The Red Sox front office believes the team may win more games without Devers due to improved team chemistry.</p>

          <p>A Senate tax bill proposes a $1,000 "baby bonus" for children born between 2024 and 2028, deposited into "Trump accounts." These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax-deferred growth and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains. To be eligible, children must be U.S. citizens at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. While proponents claim these accounts will promote wealth-building, some experts criticize their complexity compared to simpler universal savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a broader tax cut package, aiming to fulfill President Trump's "no tax on tips" pledge. Similar to a House GOP plan, the Senate measure offers a deduction on qualified tips, defined as those paid in cash or received as part of a tip-sharing arrangement. However, the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000, while the House bill has no cap. Tax experts suggest the tax break would only benefit a small portion of workers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With healthcare costs in the U.S. remaining high, many Americans are burdened with medical debt. Effective strategies to manage this debt include negotiating directly with providers for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care, and utilizing medical bill advocates to identify errors. Debt consolidation or debt management programs can also be helpful if medical debt is combined with other debts, while debt settlement should be considered as a last resort due to its potential impact on credit scores. Starting the process early is crucial for maximizing positive outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill will prevent investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment for late term abortion. The measure does not change any laws regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including the time limit, telemedicine, the grounds for abortion, or the requirement for two doctors' approval. Campaigners and abortion providers welcomed the decision, while the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) expressed concerns.</p>

The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV, the rise of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies to reach streaming-centric consumers. While traditional media companies have embraced streaming, recent restructuring announcements from major media companies may prompt changes moving forward.</p>
