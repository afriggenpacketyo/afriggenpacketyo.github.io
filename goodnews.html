The race was notable for the absence of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty, who was held back to prepare for the Belmont Stakes.

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator, in the Canadian Rockies. The creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," was equipped with a pencil sharpener-like mouth, jointed claws, and 16 segments lined with gills. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing a more complex anatomy than previously understood for radiodonts. Scientists believe the Mosura used its body flaps to swim, sharing waters with other early apex predators.</p>
