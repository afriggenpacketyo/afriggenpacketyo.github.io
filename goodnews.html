          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir prompted a dangerous escalation between India and Pakistan, bringing the two nations to the brink of war. The conflict, rooted in a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, involved missile and drone strikes, raising international concerns. The countries announced a ceasefire after U.S.-led mediation talks, following accusations of casualties on both sides. The rivalry stems from the partition of India in 1947 and the ongoing dispute over the Kashmir region, with both nations claiming the territory. This latest flare-up underscores the persistent volatility and the potential for broader conflict in the region.</p>

Charles River, a leader in pre-clinical development, has faced challenges including a post-pandemic pullback in research demand and concerns over animal testing, prompting Elliott's involvement. The strategic review aims to identify opportunities for shareholder value creation, such as evaluating the Manufacturing Solutions business, strategic acquisitions, or a potential sale of the entire company.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of avoiding the 'Too Late' label from President Trump while navigating a complex economic landscape. Economists are divided on whether Powell should proactively cut rates, given the volatile policy mix with Trump's tariffs threatening both growth and inflation. Powell has expressed confidence in the economy and dismissed the idea of pre-emptive rate cuts, citing a 'solid' economy and strong labor market. History suggests the Fed often acts too late, and the current situation, complicated by tariffs, presents a no-win scenario for Powell.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are advocating for a full, unconditional ceasefire with Russia for at least 30 days starting on Monday, aiming to initiate peace talks. This effort follows a "constructive" phone call between European leaders, U.S. President Trump, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and coincides with the end of a unilateral Russian ceasefire that Ukraine claims was repeatedly violated. Leaders from France, Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom visited Kyiv to show support and urge Russia to agree to the truce. Trump has been pressing both sides to reach a conflict-ending agreement, but Russia has yet to commit to the proposed ceasefire terms.</p>

          <p>The article argues that progressives should be concerned about rapidly falling birth rates and family formation globally, as this demographic shift poses significant economic and social challenges. An aging and shrinking population can lead to a decreased quality of life, a smaller workforce supporting a larger elderly population, and potential environmental consequences. The author suggests that progressive policies, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare, could support families and increase birth rates. It is vital to engage in discussions about population decline, avoiding partisan divides, to ensure a stable and prosperous future.</p>

          <p>A bone spear tip, discovered in Russia, has been dated to be 80,000 years old, suggesting that Neanderthals, not modern humans, created the hunting weapon. This finding challenges previous assumptions about Neanderthal technology, indicating they developed advanced bone tool techniques independently. The spear tip joins other recent discoveries that demonstrate Neanderthals' sophisticated tool-making abilities. The level of craftsmanship of these tools is not as advanced as those found in Europe after modern humans arrived, but the scarcity of Neanderthal bone tools may be due to decay over time.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), introduced by Representatives Titus and Omar, seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances. This legislation would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that prevent federal funds from supporting research on schedule I substances. Supporters argue that the bill would allow research to catch up with the increasing cannabis consumption and enable policymakers to craft more effective, evidence-based policies. While its passage remains uncertain, advocates believe it represents a vital step toward shaping smart cannabis policy.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's re-election, there has been an increase in wealthy Americans relocating to the Cotswolds in England. Applications for UK citizenship from the US have surged, and American buyers have overtaken Chinese buyers in London's prime real estate market. The Cotswolds, with its idyllic villages and countryside, is becoming a popular destination, with luxury brands and businesses catering to the influx. Wealth managers are also reporting increased inquiries from Americans seeking to move their assets away from the country, driven by political fears and attacks on academia.</p>

          <p>Media mogul Barry Diller, in his new memoir "Who Knew," candidly discusses his "dysfunctional" childhood, dazzling career, and previously shrouded personal life, including his bisexuality and long, happy marriage to Diane von Furstenberg. Diller reflects on the challenges of coming of age in America with a complex sexuality, noting the pressures he faced and his initial "chicken" behavior in hiding his true self. He acknowledges a sense of guilt for not being a role model earlier in his life, and shares his views on the changing media landscape, politics, and his many cultural contributions.</p>
