        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, reversing a previous decision to suspend the show indefinitely. The suspension followed controversial comments by the host regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted major broadcast station owners like Sinclair and Nexstar to preempt the program. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, Disney executives decided to reinstate the show, a move that has been a focal point in a national debate about free speech and political pressure.</p>

          <p>India is investing over $18 billion into its "Semiconductor Mission" with the ambitious goal of creating a complete, domestic chip supply chain, from design to fabrication and packaging. This strategic push aims to reduce reliance on imports, secure chips for key sectors, and capture a larger share of the global electronics market as it shifts away from China. While the government has approved ten major projects, including two fabrication plants, experts caution that India faces steep competition and must overcome significant hurdles related to infrastructure, talent, and policy to become a global chip powerhouse.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has called for the government to offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research has been defunded by the Trump administration. In a speech, Davey proposed a fellowship scheme to attract these researchers, stating that the UK should step in to support science if the U.S. will not. The move follows the U.S. government's decision to cut billions from biomedical research grants, a decision that has prompted concern among the scientific community about the future of life-saving medical advancements in America.</p>

          <p>The suspension and subsequent reinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show briefly became a factor in the New York City mayoral race. Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani announced he was withdrawing from a scheduled town hall on WABC-TV to protest what he called the network's capitulation to pressure from the Trump administration. After Disney announced Kimmel's return, Mamdani stated he would reschedule his appearance, calling the reinstatement a "victory for free speech." The incident highlights how national debates over media censorship and political influence are resonating in local political contests.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Comedians Have a Patriotic Duty to Satirize Power Amidst Censorship Fears</h2>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the return of Jimmy Kimmel to television is a critical moment in the fight against authoritarianism and self-censorship. The author contends that humor is a powerful tool for holding power accountable and that comedians have a patriotic duty to continue satirizing political leaders, especially when faced with intimidation. The article frames the recent pressure on Kimmel as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to silence dissent, drawing historical parallels to how autocratic regimes target comedians. It urges Kimmel not to temper his comedy, as doing so would signal that fear has triumphed over free expression.</p>

          <p>Defense technology company Anduril is preparing for the first flight of its YFQ-44A Fury drone, a candidate for the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. The company has prioritized developing advanced autonomy, planning for the drone's first takeoff and landing to be executed semi-autonomously with the push of a button, rather than by a remote pilot. While this focus on software has slightly delayed the maiden flight, Anduril believes it will accelerate the overall testing and development timeline. Multiple Fury aircraft are currently in production to support an expansive flight test schedule over the next year.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same unresolved symptoms three times. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to prevent missed diagnoses of serious illnesses. The goal is to make this proactive approach standard practice and improve patient safety, particularly for younger individuals.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive economic and social blueprint that will guide the nation's development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a cornerstone of the country's governance and is seen as critical for achieving its goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions at the upcoming fourth plenary session, the plan is expected to address rising challenges both domestically and internationally. Experts suggest that Beijing may need to prioritize qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to maintain flexibility in a turbulent global environment.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a crucial tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning social media posts made by a former student, leading to a campus lockdown and the eventual detainment of the individual. The reporting system was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded by families of the 2012 school shooting victims. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped thwart since its inception, highlighting the critical role of community vigilance in preventing violence.</p>
