          <p>The Amazon World zoo on the Isle of Wight has joyfully announced the birth of endangered red panda twins, a significant success for its breeding program. The cubs were born on June 17 to their mother, Xiao, and a much younger male, Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo in 2024. The zoo is closely monitoring the new family via CCTV, as the cubs will remain in their nest box for about three months. Red pandas are threatened by poaching and habitat loss in their native eastern Himalayas and China.</p>

          <h2>Minnesota to Mandate Mental Health Warning Labels on Social Media Platforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in July 2026, Minnesota will become the first state to require social media platforms to display a warning label about the potential mental health hazards of prolonged use. The law, championed by state Democrats, aims to function like warnings on tobacco or alcohol, prompting users to consider the links between social media and issues like depression and anxiety. While supported by youth and mental health advocates, the measure faces opposition from tech industry group NetChoice, which argues it compels private companies to spread the state's message and may lead to a legal challenge.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists and scientists are highlighting that some children have a stronger innate food reward drive, making them more susceptible to overconsuming ultra-processed foods. This article explains that for these children, standard advice may not be effective, and a different approach is needed to foster healthy eating habits. Experts suggest parents can help by not keeping large quantities of these foods at home and instead making them available only on special occasions. This strategy helps children regulate their eating with whole foods and avoids setting them up for failure in an environment where ultra-processed options are ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba has unveiled its first pair of smart glasses, powered by its proprietary Qwen large language model and Quark AI assistant. The Quark AI Glasses, set to launch in China by the end of 2025, will compete directly with similar wearable devices from Meta and Xiaomi. The glasses will offer features like hands-free calling, real-time translation, and integration with Alibaba's ecosystem, including its mapping service and the Alipay payment platform. This move into hardware is seen as a strategic effort to expand the distribution of Alibaba's advanced AI applications.</p>

          <p>U.S. chipmaker Nvidia was notably absent from China's major World AI Conference in Shanghai, while its primary Chinese competitor, Huawei, featured a prominent display of its Ascend AI chips. Huawei showcased its new "Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD" computing system, designed to power AI model training by linking hundreds of its chips together. This event highlighted the growing strength of China's domestic AI supply chain, with numerous local firms exhibiting their technology. The conference atmosphere suggested a decreasing reliance on Nvidia, even as the U.S. firm hopes to resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China.</p>

          <p>England has added fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to its cricket squad for the final Test match against India at The Oval. The move is intended to provide cover and reinforce the pace attack, which was significantly taxed during the grueling fourth Test in Manchester. Captain Ben Stokes indicated that "fresh legs" might be necessary for the series decider, given the short turnaround time between matches. Overton, who has one previous Test cap, joins Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue as the other pace bowlers available, with England needing to avoid defeat to win the series.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian burial offering. The print was found on the underside of a clay "soul house," a model building placed in tombs, dating from 2055 to 1650 BC. Curators believe the handprint was left by the potter who moved the object to dry before it was fired in a kiln. Described as a rare and exciting find, the artifact provides a direct human connection to the ancient craftsmen who are often overlooked in history. The item will be featured in an upcoming exhibition.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework agreement on tariffs, establishing a 15% rate on many major European exports to the US, including cars. This deal avoids a threatened 30% tariff but is higher than the previous rate and the UK's 10% tariff. In return, the EU will open its markets to American exports at zero tariff and has committed to purchasing billions in US energy and arms. While the Trump administration hails it as a major victory, Brussels views it as a necessary compromise that provides stability, though EU steel and aluminum still face a 50% tariff.

          <p>This analysis of the new US-EU trade deal highlights five key points, noting that while it averts a worse conflict, significant tariffs remain. The deal sets a 15% tariff on many EU goods, but a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum persists, and the President retains the power to increase rates. It creates a tariff disparity on the island of Ireland, disadvantaging the Republic of Ireland compared to Northern Ireland. German industry has expressed disappointment with the rates, which remain historically high despite being framed as a stabilizing agreement by EU officials. (not investment advice)</p>
