        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $118,000, driven by significant institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, these ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion. This rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and legislative progress on cryptocurrency regulation. The price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend as traders covered their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A unique cocktail favored by pop star Lady Gaga is gaining viral attention on social media, leading to mixed reactions. The drink, a Spanish kalimotxo, consists of red wine mixed with cola, which Gaga personalizes with maraschino cherries and Diet Coke. While some TikTok creators have described the combination as a "boozy cherry Coke," others have labeled it "mayhem in a glass." Brand strategists note that the singer's unconventional choice aligns with her boundary-pushing image and taps into a trend of nostalgic, low-effort drinks with global origins.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance following a strong fiscal second quarter that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The denim maker announced it plans to absorb some of the increased costs from new tariffs, currently estimated to impact earnings by only 2 to 3 cents per share. CEO Michelle Gass attributed the company's resilience to strong consumer demand, reduced promotions, and successful product innovations, particularly in its women's apparel and direct-to-consumer channels.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting "national priority" vouchers, which can significantly speed up the approval process for new treatments. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary confirmed that making drugs more affordable is a national priority, aligning with a key goal of the Trump administration. This new policy aims to incentivize pharmaceutical companies to lower prices, though it remains unclear how affordability will be assessed before a drug's market launch. The program is part of a broader effort to address health crises and increase domestic drug manufacturing.</p>

          <p>In a notable development, the Shanghai branch of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has urged state-owned enterprises to research the potential use of stablecoins and other digital assets. The regulator called on these firms to study how technologies like blockchain could be applied to cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This pronouncement is significant given China's long-standing ban on most cryptocurrency activities. It aligns with recent state media calls for a more proactive approach to regulating stablecoins and exploring their role in globalizing the yuan.</p>

          <p>IMAX is on track for its most successful year ever, with CEO Rich Gelfond forecasting a record $1.2 billion at the global box office. The company's success is driven by a consumer shift toward premium experiences and a strong slate of films shot with IMAX's specialized cameras, such as "F1: The Movie." These "filmed for IMAX" titles often see the company capture over 20% of the domestic box office, despite its screens making up less than 1% of the worldwide total. With a robust film lineup for 2025 and 2026 and plans for 500 new theaters, the company is positioned for continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a media investigation that exposed lax oversight and questionable spending, Texas is overhauling its "Thriving Texas Families" program, which funds anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. The program, with a budget growing to $100 million, will now require organizations to document all expenses and receive reimbursement only for actual, state-approved costs. Previously, a flat-rate system allowed some centers to profit from state funds and use them for expenses like real estate. The changes aim to bring accountability to a program that has funneled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to a network of nonprofits with minimal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Xinjiang University have developed a robot designed to automate the process of cotton topping, a crucial but labor-intensive step in cotton farming. The robot uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and remove the top bud of a cotton plant with a high-powered laser, redirecting the plant's nutrients to boost boll formation and yield. The system reportedly achieves over 82% topping success with high accuracy and minimal damage to the plants. This innovation promises to significantly improve efficiency and reduce labor costs in Xinjiang's vast cotton industry, though it is still in the pilot testing phase.</p>
