          <p>James Gunn, co-head of DC Studios, believes the movie industry is struggling due to incomplete screenplays, which is why DC Studios mandates finished scripts before production. Gunn also addressed rumors that Matt Reeves' sequel to "The Batman" is canceled, confirming it is still in development but delayed due to script work. Reflecting on his past firing from Marvel, Gunn believes it helped him create from a less pleasing place. Gunn also emphasized DC Studios' focus on quality over quantity, aiming to release only the best projects. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a significant majority, ensuring that women who terminate their pregnancies outside the current legal framework will no longer face criminal investigation. The new law does not change any existing regulations regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, such as time limits or the requirement for two doctors' approval. While welcomed by abortion providers, some organizations expressed concern that it did not go far enough, and others are worried about the implications for unborn children.

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a larger tax package, mirroring a similar provision passed by the House. Both versions offer a deduction on qualified tips, but the Senate bill caps the deduction at $25,000 per year, unlike the uncapped House version. The Senate legislation also features different income limits for eligibility, gradually reducing the value of the tax deduction as income increases, whereas the House bill makes the tax deduction completely unavailable once an individual's income hits $160,000 per year. While the proposal has bipartisan appeal, experts suggest that it may not benefit many workers. (not investment advice)</p>
