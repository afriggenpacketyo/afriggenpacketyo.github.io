          <p>Tesla's board is awarding CEO Elon Musk approximately $29 billion in restricted stock, a move that comes just months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, larger pay package. The judge had ruled the original 2018 package was improperly negotiated with a board that lacked independence. This new award requires Musk to pay the exercise price per share from the voided plan. The decision reignites the debate over executive compensation and corporate governance at the electric vehicle company, following a shareholder lawsuit that challenged the initial pay deal as excessive.</p>

          <p>India has won a thrilling Test match against England at The Oval by a mere six runs, leveling the series at 2-2 in a dramatic conclusion. England's pursuit of a record-breaking 374-run target fell just short in a tense final day. The match featured a heroic but ultimately unsuccessful effort from an injured Chris Woakes, who came out to bat in the final moments. The incredible contest has been hailed as one of the greatest in Test cricket history, concluding a hard-fought and memorable series between the two teams.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is imposing significant tariffs on imported copper and copper products, following a Department of Commerce investigation that deemed the reliance on foreign sources a national security risk. This opinion article argues the move is a decisive action to counteract unfair trade practices from countries like China and Chile, which have harmed the U.S. copper industry. The tariffs, including an immediate 50% duty on semi-finished products, are intended to revitalize domestic mining and refining, create American jobs, and secure a critical material for defense and technology sectors.

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is launching a second independent campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska, this time challenging Republican Senator Pete Ricketts. After a surprisingly strong showing against the state's other Republican senator in the previous election, Osborn is running on a working-class platform, contrasting his background with that of the wealthy incumbent. Osborn aims to appeal to voters tired of the two-party system and believes there is an appetite for an independent voice in a deeply Republican state. The state's Democratic party has indicated support for his campaign.</p>

The Police Records Access Project, a collaboration between universities, news outlets, and civil liberties groups, compiles documents from nearly 700 law enforcement agencies. This initiative significantly expands public access to internal affairs records that were previously difficult to obtain. The project aims to increase transparency and accountability in law enforcement by making information about internal investigations more accessible to the public and journalists.</p>

          <h2>Survey Suggests Lack of Real-World Freedom Drives Children to Online Socializing</h2>

          <p>A new survey of American children aged 8-12 reveals that while they are deeply immersed in a "phone-based childhood," they overwhelmingly prefer unstructured, in-person play with friends. This article argues that the rise of screen time is not just due to addictive technology, but also because parents increasingly restrict their children's real-world independence out of safety fears. With limited ability to explore their neighborhoods or play unsupervised, children turn to their phones as the one space where they can socialize freely. The authors advocate for restoring childhood independence to improve well-being.</p>

          <p>Kate Forbes, the Deputy First Minister of Scotland, has announced that she will not seek re-election as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) in the 2026 Holyrood election. In her announcement, Forbes cited a desire to spend more time with her young family and not miss the "precious early years of family life." First elected in 2016, she had a swift political ascent, becoming finance secretary and narrowly losing the 2023 SNP leadership contest. She will continue to serve as an MSP and in her current government role until the election.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of industry and government data reveals a dramatic collapse in global fur production, which has fallen from over 140 million animals in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This article explains the decline as a result of a major shift in public perception, successful animal welfare campaigns, and legislative action. Pressure from advocates led major fashion brands like Gucci and Prada to adopt fur-free policies, while numerous European countries have banned fur farming. The COVID-19 pandemic and economic factors in China and Russia also accelerated the industry's downturn.</p>

          <p>CK Asset Holdings has issued a formal statement to deny widespread social media rumors that the prominent Li family is selling its residence of over 50 years at 79 Deep Water Bay Road in Hong Kong. The company, on behalf of chairman Victor Li, called the speculation "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." The denial comes at a time when some of Hong Kong's other wealthy families have been forced to sell assets at discounts due to economic pressures. Li urged the public not to trust such rumors, particularly given the recent rise in financial scams.</p>

          <p>China's central bank is intensifying efforts to promote the international use of its currency, the yuan, seeing an opportunity as the stability of the U.S. dollar is increasingly questioned. The People's Bank of China announced plans to expand the yuan's use in trade and finance, enhance its offshore market, and develop its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This renewed focus on yuan internationalization is the first time in three years it has been a dedicated topic in the bank's midyear meeting summary, signaling a strategic push to increase the currency's global influence.

A local resident reported that the dog persistently barked and led him across a busy street to the secluded camp, where he discovered the man and woman.

The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in this age group fell from nearly 13% to 10%. While experts find the data hopeful, they caution that millions of teens still struggle and access to mental health care remains a significant challenge.

This article highlights five key revelations from the book, including the fact that Springsteen was at risk of being dropped by his record label and initially disliked the finished album, even throwing a copy into a pool. It also explores the pivotal role of producer Jon Landau in shaping the album's sound and Springsteen's own perfectionism, which led to an all-night recording session for Clarence Clemons' iconic saxophone solo.</p>
