          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final after decisively defeating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets. The 38-year-old Djokovic acknowledged that age and physical wear are becoming significant factors in his performance against younger, sharper opponents. In the other semi-final, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz overcame American Taylor Fritz in a hard-fought four-set match. This sets up a highly anticipated final between Sinner and Alcaraz, a rematch of their recent five-set epic at the French Open, continuing the rivalry between the two dominant young stars of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions on journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by press rights organizations, which argued that reporters were being deliberately targeted while covering demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The judge cited specific instances, including an officer appearing to aim at an Australian reporter on live TV. The order protects journalists from being assaulted or obstructed and ensures they can access protest areas, reaffirming 1st Amendment rights and press freedoms.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced the recent arrests of five illegal immigrants with prior serious criminal convictions. The individuals, taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), had convictions ranging from second-degree murder and assault to sexual abuse of a child and possession of child sexual abuse material. An assistant secretary stated that under the current administration, DHS is focused on restoring law and order by targeting and removing such individuals from the country. These enforcement actions are proceeding despite continued pushback and legal challenges from officials in some cities and states over federal immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to overseeing a massive operation that trafficked large quantities of fentanyl into the United States. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez is required to provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government in exchange for a potential sentence of less than life in prison. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to strike such a deal with federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally and triggered over $650 million in short liquidations. The market momentum is also attributed to speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and the potential for increased federal deficits, which some investors view as a positive catalyst for the digital currency.

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium travel classes, such as business and first class, mirroring the tiered options it pioneered in its main economy cabin. With revenue from premium seats growing while economy sales have declined, the airline sees an opportunity to offer different service levels to high-end customers with varying needs. While specifics were not disclosed, possibilities could range from a less expensive business class ticket without lounge access to a more luxurious suite with extra amenities. The move reflects an industry trend toward greater product differentiation at the front of the plane.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongfully deported to an El Salvadoran mega-prison in March, are asking a federal judge to require 72 hours' notice before any future removal. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face charges of transporting undocumented migrants but fears immediate re-deportation if released on bond. A 2019 court order had barred his removal to El Salvador due to fears of persecution. The judge heavily criticized the government for its lack of a clear plan to ensure his due process rights, given the highly irregular nature of his case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely driven by a significant increase in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, following the administration's implementation of broad new tariffs on imports. This monthly surplus helped narrow the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion, though it remains 5% higher than the same period last year. Meanwhile, net interest on the national debt continues to be a major expenditure, totaling $84 billion for the month alone. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which avoids a trial, brings the total recovery for residents to over $90 million, following earlier settlements with three other companies. The lawsuit claimed that a local facility that coated fabrics with Teflon, using materials from DuPont and 3M, caused the contamination. PFOA is a harmful "forever chemical" linked to serious illnesses and is now classified as a carcinogen. The settlement includes $6 million for an ongoing medical monitoring program for residents.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential benefit clawbacks, seniors are exploring alternative ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines several financial options available to older homeowners and savers. These include reverse mortgages, which provide monthly payments from home equity without immediate repayment, and annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum investment. For more immediate needs, personal loans are presented as a potential, though more costly, option to bridge financial gaps, offering an alternative to high-interest credit cards for emergency funds.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly access their home's equity, several modern lending strategies can expedite the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with fully online lenders can significantly reduce processing time through digital platforms and automated verification. Some lenders also offer low- or no-documentation HELOCs that minimize paperwork for financially stable borrowers. Additionally, using a lender that employs automated or desktop appraisals instead of traditional in-person ones can shave weeks off the timeline, though these faster methods may come with tradeoffs like higher rates or more conservative credit limits.
