          <p>Christian singer Brandon Lake was inspired to set more personal boundaries after hearing about Jelly Roll throwing his phone in a river due to feeling overwhelmed. Lake, who collaborated with Jelly Roll on his new album "King of Hearts," realized he needed to narrow his circle of contacts as his success grew. Lake released his new album, "King of Hearts," this month, and he emphasized his desire to minister to people and shepherd them well. He also mentioned that he wouldn't sing about drugs, but instead prefers to sing about his faith and how it has changed his life.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against dissolving the lower house of parliament for a snap election, according to a lawmaker. Yoshihiko Noda, head of the main opposition party, has also ruled out submitting a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet. These decisions make same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. The House of Councillors election is expected to proceed on July 20, amidst ongoing concerns over U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is working to address the shortage of air traffic controllers in the U.S. by offering an accelerated training program that mirrors the FAA Academy. The FAA is currently short over 3,000 certified controllers, leading to mandatory overtime and six-day work weeks for existing personnel. The accelerated program allows students to begin medical and background checks early, potentially skipping the FAA Academy altogether and shortening the hiring process from years to weeks or months. The program aims to quickly supply qualified candidates to the FAA.</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected across much of the United States, it's crucial to take precautions when spending time outdoors. Experts recommend checking the heat index, which accounts for both temperature and humidity, and planning activities for earlier in the day. Wearing lightweight, breathable clothing, using sunscreen, and seeking shady environments can also help prevent heat-related illnesses. Recognizing the symptoms of heat exhaustion and staying hydrated are essential for staying safe during hot weather.</p>
