          <p>Swiss food conglomerate Nestlé has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation confirmed he had an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The company stated the dismissal was effective immediately, as the relationship constituted a conflict of interest and a violation of its code of conduct. The inquiry was reportedly initiated through a whistleblower channel, reinforcing the company's stated commitment to its governance values. Long-time executive Philipp Navratil has been appointed as the new CEO to ensure strategic continuity and maintain performance momentum.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, 'The Smashing Machine,' features a transformed Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr, chronicling his battle with substance abuse and the existential crisis following his first professional loss. The review praises Johnson's serious, non-satirical portrayal and highlights strong supporting performances, particularly from Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn. While the film is described as a solid drama that effectively captures moments of vulnerability, it is noted for not reaching the tragic depths of similar sports biopics. The movie is seen as a compelling watch for fans of the sport and a showcase for Johnson's dramatic range.</p>

The driver was reportedly alert and sustained only minor injuries.

          <p>Manchester United has confirmed the departure of two of its forwards, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Italian champions Napoli on a season-long loan and Antony completing a permanent move to Spanish club Real Betis. Hojlund's deal includes a £38 million obligation to buy, while Antony's transfer is valued at £21.65 million. Both players, who were expensive signings for United, struggled to find consistent form at Old Trafford and were deemed surplus to requirements by the club's management. The moves are part of a broader effort to revamp the team's attack under manager Ruben Amorim.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Impact on Animal Size Evolution Over Millennia</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals, starting in the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzing thousands of animal bones from southern France found that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species such as foxes and deer became smaller. In contrast, domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for specific traits. The findings underscore the profound and lasting impact of human activities on the natural world over the past millennium.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has finalized his team by naming six wildcard picks, resulting in a squad that includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Despite the continuity, Donald warned the U.S. team not to expect a "rinse and repeat" of their previous strategy. He emphasized that playing on American soil presents a different challenge that will require a new approach and different player pairings. Donald also urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd at Bethpage rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced gains, driven by positive developments in the defense and healthcare sectors. Defense industry shares climbed after the UK announced a £10 billion warship export deal with Norway, its largest ever by value, which will benefit contractors like BAE Systems. Simultaneously, Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk saw its stock rise after releasing trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than rival products from Eli Lilly. These corporate news items provided a strong start to the month for European markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The August nonfarm payroll report, due on Friday, will be closely watched as a key indicator for the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, with a weak report potentially solidifying expectations for a September cut. Additionally, earnings from companies like Salesforce and AI chipmaker Broadcom will provide further insight into the health of the enterprise software and semiconductor sectors. The market will also be digesting a recent appeals court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has scrapped peak-time fares on its nationalized rail service, ScotRail, in a significant trial aimed at simplifying ticketing and boosting passenger numbers. The move, which drastically reduces the cost of commuter-hour travel, reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with officials stating there is now sufficient capacity on the network. This initiative has sparked a debate on whether England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could follow suit. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided on whether such a change would lead to overcrowding on busy routes or require fare increases elsewhere to cover lost revenue.</p>
