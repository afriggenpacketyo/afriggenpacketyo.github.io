        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued on Thursday, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price surged, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. The rally was also supported by macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, reinforcing Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Additionally, positive regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act, and pro-crypto stances from U.S. leaders contributed to the market's bullish sentiment.</p>

High NA improves chip speed and performance, increases yield, and projects smaller chip designs in fewer steps.

          <p>Novo Nordisk has temporarily reduced the price of Wegovy to $199 for new customers who previously took compounded versions of the medication, aiming to limit sales of these alternatives. This offer is available until June 30 and is intended for uninsured patients or those whose insurance doesn't cover the drug. The announcement coincides with a federal deadline for manufacturers to cease distributing less expensive, compounded versions of the drug. The FDA has stated that shortages of Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound are over, prompting concerns about patient access to affordable options.</p>
