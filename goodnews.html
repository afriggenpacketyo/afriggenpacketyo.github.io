          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated there is a "viable chance" for a ceasefire in Ukraine. He emphasized that any agreement must be lasting and protect Ukraine's territorial integrity, backed by credible security guarantees from a coalition of allied nations. Starmer credited President Trump's diplomatic efforts for creating the first real opportunity for a peaceful resolution in over three years. The statement came after European leaders, including Starmer, held a joint call with Trump to align on their positions before the talks.</p>

          <p>Following their $8 billion takeover, David Ellison and his new leadership team at Paramount have detailed their vision to revitalize the media company. The strategy involves a significant increase in film production, aiming to nearly double the studio's annual output to 15-20 movies, with a focus on major franchises like “Top Gun,” “Star Trek,” and “Transformers.” Ellison emphasized a goal of moving the company away from political divisions to create entertainment for a broad audience. The new management, backed by Skydance Media and RedBird Capital, plans to restore Paramount's status as a top destination for creative talent.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, narrowly avoided a catastrophic event as record-breaking floodwaters from the Mendenhall Glacier began to recede. The annual "outburst flood" from the glacier-dammed Suicide Basin peaked at 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and prompting targeted evacuations. City officials credited the successful mitigation to newly installed temporary barriers, which protected nearly 1,000 structures from potentially devastating damage from the icy, silt-filled water. While the immediate threat has passed, the recurring event, linked to climate change, remains a significant annual concern for the community.</p>

          <p>A growing number of professionals are engaging in "bleisure" travel, the practice of bringing family or friends along on business trips to blend work with personal vacation time. A recent survey found that over half of business travelers have had loved ones join them, a figure that rises to 73% for C-suite executives. This trend is driven by a desire to reclaim personal time and reduce travel loneliness, as well as for financial reasons, as it can significantly cut vacation costs. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a policy gray area regarding expenses and transparency.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of Sandy Hook victims. This move strips conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of control over the Infowars brand, studio, and property, paving the way for their sale within days or weeks. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction with the ruling, seeing it as a final step toward accountability for Jones's cruel harassment. This development also reopens the possibility that the satirical site The Onion could purchase the Infowars brand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study conducted in Sweden suggests that medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may provide significant benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that drug treatment was associated with reduced risks of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. These issues are often linked to impulsivity and distraction, common traits of ADHD. Researchers say these findings provide crucial information for patients weighing the decision to start medication, highlighting potential long-term protective effects against adverse life events.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. trade policies curbing China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean conglomerates are increasing their investments in Southeast Asia to maintain a competitive edge. HD Hyundai is reportedly investing $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to ten vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts suggest this strategic shift to regions with lower labor costs is a way for Korean firms to overcome domestic constraints like labor shortages and union tensions. This move allows them to strengthen their market position while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur suffered a heartbreaking loss to Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup, losing on penalties after holding a 2-0 lead with only five minutes of normal time remaining. Despite the late collapse, the performance under new manager Thomas Frank showed promising signs for the upcoming season. The team's tactical discipline, pragmatism, and effectiveness on set-pieces, which produced both of their goals, were notable departures from last season's approach. While the result was a blow, the article suggests the team displayed the basis of a strong system that can be built upon.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes a significant shift in the media landscape, where public trust is moving away from traditional institutions like news outlets and government toward individual online creators. For the first time, more Americans are getting news from social platforms than from traditional media, turning to influencers for information. While this environment is ripe for misinformation, a cohort of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and specialists—are working to provide credible, nuanced information directly to audiences. The essay argues that for this new media ecosystem to thrive, it needs new infrastructure, such as certification systems and collaborative frameworks, similar to how the music industry adapted to streaming.</p>
