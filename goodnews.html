          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket has successfully completed its 11th test flight, launching from a Texas facility and achieving its goal of a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The mission saw the Super Heavy booster perform a controlled return to the Gulf of Mexico, marking another significant advancement in the development of the world's largest rocket. This successful test is a crucial step for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified version of Starship for its upcoming manned missions to the Moon's south pole. The flight demonstrates increasing reliability after previous tests ended in explosions.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Scotland, Cameron McGerr, is advocating for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to separate heart conditions. He believes that knowing CPR could have potentially saved his father's life, as he lost critical time in a panic while waiting for emergency operator instructions. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already successfully introduced training at his own school, and he is now urging lawmakers to implement a nationwide program to better equip young people with these life-saving skills.</p>

          <h2>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Advocates for Targeted Prostate Cancer Screening Program</h2>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for the implementation of a national screening program for prostate cancer in the UK. Acting as an ambassador for a cancer research charity, Sunak argued that a targeted program focusing on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men, would be affordable and could save countless lives. The proposal comes as the UK's National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the potential for over-treatment and its side effects.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully restored a 1,600-year-old masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess," using artificial intelligence. The original work, penned by the 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, had only about 250 surviving characters. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the remaining text, the team's AI model was able to replicate and generate the missing characters, resulting in a complete scroll of 919 characters. This project demonstrates the potential of AI to preserve and reconstruct ancient cultural heritage in the digital age.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase the number of young blood donors, people applying for a driving licence in the UK will now be encouraged to register to donate blood. The initiative, a partnership between the NHS and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), will include a registration link in emails sent to millions of applicants each year. With over half of regular donors being over 45, the NHS hopes this campaign will appeal directly to young people, who can begin donating at age 17, the same age they can learn to drive.</p>

          <p>In his first appearance with the Chicago Bears, kicker Jake Moody successfully converted a 38-yard field goal with just three seconds remaining to secure a 25-24 victory over the Washington Commanders.

The game-winning kick came after the Bears' defense recovered a late-game fumble by Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, allowing Chicago's offense to drive into field goal range and improve their season record to 3-2.</p>

The Blue Jays, who were a dominant offensive force against the Yankees, have struggled to generate runs, scoring only four times in the first two games. Star player Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been held hitless in the series so far. Historically, teams that win the first two games on the road in a best-of-seven series have a very high probability of advancing.</p>

Despite a comeback attempt by Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Atlanta's defense held firm, securing the win with a late interception. The loss raises questions about the Bills' strong start to the season, as their previous wins were against teams with poor records.</p>

          <p>A woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury that impaired her speech has found a new way to communicate and regain confidence by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Tina, 59, sustained the injury after a fall in 2018 left her in a coma for six weeks. Learning BSL has helped her express words she struggles to speak and has allowed her to relax, as she can often recall a sign even when a spoken word escapes her. Her journey was featured in a BBC series exploring how BSL can benefit older individuals.</p>

The central bank expects global AI investment to support the nation's manufacturing sector, but anticipates a normalization of activity in trade-related areas will lead to slower overall growth.

          <p>China has announced the mass production of a highly sensitive, four-channel single-photon detector, a core component for developing advanced quantum radar systems. This technology, capable of detecting the smallest unit of energy, is expected to significantly enhance China's ability to track stealth aircraft like the F-22. The breakthrough represents a major advancement in quantum technology with powerful applications not only in national defense but also in fields like quantum communication. The development was achieved by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province.</p>
