          <p>South Korean soccer star Son Heung-min was officially introduced as a player for Los Angeles FC, a move celebrated as a major signing for the MLS. In his first press conference, Son candidly admitted that LAFC was not his initial choice, but a conversation with the club's general manager, John Thorrington, changed his mind and heart. His arrival is seen as a significant cultural moment for Los Angeles, which has a large Korean-American population, and is expected to provide a major boost to the team both on the field and in its community engagement.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand air force successfully completed a challenging medical evacuation of three American staff members from McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was conducted in extreme cold and total darkness, conditions that make mid-winter flights to the continent exceptionally hazardous. One individual required urgent care, while the other two were transported as a precaution, with a medical team providing in-flight support during the journey back to Christchurch. U.S. officials praised the "flawless" operation and the world-class skill of their New Zealand partners.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to tighten regulations on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from unqualified practitioners and dangerous procedures. The new rules will require clinics to obtain licenses to offer treatments like Botox and fillers, and the most high-risk procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts, will be restricted to qualified health professionals. This crackdown follows growing concerns over patient harm and at least one death linked to an unregulated procedure, aiming to establish clear safety and training standards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old students are likely to secure their first-choice university spot this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. This increased flexibility from universities is attributed to uncertainty around international student enrollment, making domestic undergraduates a more stable and financially reliable option for institutions. As a result, universities are making more offers, which is expected to lead to fewer available places during the "clearing" process for students who did not meet their initial offers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets anticipate that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth reduction since last August and bringing borrowing costs to a two-year low. A rate cut would provide relief for some mortgage holders but would mean lower returns for savers. The expected move comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation, with no growth reported in April and May. Signs of a cooling labor market, including falling payroll numbers and slower wage growth, are also weighing on the Bank's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that survivors of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in AD 79 returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe some residents who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, established a precarious settlement within the devastated city. This informal occupation, which may have lasted until the 5th century, saw people living in the upper floors of buried homes while using lower levels as cellars. The findings challenge the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event.</p>
