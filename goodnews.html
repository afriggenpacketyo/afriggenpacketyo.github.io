        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeep is overhauling its high-end Grand Wagoneer models for 2026 as part of a major brand turnaround plan. The changes include updated styling, a simplified model lineup under a single "Grand Wagoneer" name, and a new extended-range powertrain option. The company acknowledged that the initial launch confused consumers with dual nameplates and high prices, leading to disappointing sales. With a new starting price under $65,000, Stellantis aims to make the flagship SUV more competitive and regain market share for its crucial Jeep brand.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a record trading performance of nearly $9 billion. The bank's profit increased by 12% to $14.39 billion, with both fixed income and equity trading revenues showing significant jumps. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the firm benefited from a resilient U.S. economy but is also preparing for potential future turbulence due to geopolitical conditions and inflation risks. The strong results reflect a broader trend of large banks capitalizing on market volatility and a favorable environment for investment banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the United Kingdom's economy will be the second-fastest growing among the G7 nations this year and next, with a modest growth rate of 1.3%. This outlook places the UK ahead of other major European economies like Germany and France, trailing only the United States. However, the IMF also warns that the UK is expected to face the highest inflation rate in the G7 for 2025 and 2026, primarily due to rising energy costs. The global forecast remains cautious, citing risks from US tariffs and a potential correction in the AI-driven tech market. (not investment advice)</p>

Shanahan described the exchange as an "intense conversation" between competitive individuals and stated it was not a significant issue.

Shanahan expressed his support for the emotional player, hoping he can get healthier to contribute more consistently to the injury-plagued team.</p>

          <p>Rockefeller Capital Management has secured new investment from several ultra-wealthy family offices, including those of the Chanel dynasty and hedge fund manager David Abrams. The financing deal raises the firm's valuation to $6.6 billion, more than double its 2023 valuation of $3 billion. The firm, which originated from John D. Rockefeller's family office, now manages $187 billion in assets. CEO Greg Fleming stated the new capital will be used to expand its services for high-net-worth clients, hire more advisors, and potentially tap into international markets in Asia and the Middle East.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its investment banking and fixed income trading divisions. The bank's profit surged 37% to $4.1 billion, with investment banking fees jumping 42% due to increased merger and debt underwriting activity. Like other Wall Street firms, Goldman benefited from market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariff policies, which increased trading activity. The results highlight the firm's continued strength in its core Wall Street operations, even as its equities trading division slightly underperformed expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is launching its new iPhone Air in mainland China, with CEO Tim Cook promoting the device during a visit to the country. The launch coincides with China's three major telecom operators receiving approval to begin commercial trials of eSIM functionality in smartphones. The lack of eSIM support had previously delayed the iPhone Air's release in China by about a month compared to global markets. This regulatory milestone is significant for the industry, as it allows for thinner device designs and is expected to be adopted by Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Oppo in the future.</p>

          <p>A wave of "Gen Z uprisings" has swept across several South and Southeast Asian nations, including Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines. While the specific triggers vary, the underlying causes are consistent: anger over widening inequality, stagnant economic prospects for young people, and conspicuous displays of elite wealth and corruption. These digitally-organized movements have forced governments to make rare concessions, such as reversing a social media ban in Nepal and scrapping lavish perks for politicians in Timor-Leste. The protests highlight a growing discontent among the region's youth, who feel they have little to lose by taking to the streets.</p>

          <p>Oprah Winfrey has chosen "A Guardian and a Thief," a novel by Megha Majumdar, as her latest book club selection. The story is set in the author's hometown of Kolkata, India, and explores the desperate measures two families take to protect their children amid a food shortage and extreme climate change. Winfrey praised the book for its surprising narrative shift, stating she had "never read a book quite like this." Majumdar explained that she wanted to examine how love, hope, and morality are tested during a time of scarcity, and what happens when individual survival clashes with community well-being.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new set of laws aimed at increasing online safety for children, addressing growing concerns around artificial intelligence and social media. One landmark law requires AI chatbots to disclose that they are not human and to prompt minors to take breaks, while also implementing tools to protect against harmful content. Other bills mandate warning labels on social media apps about potential mental health risks and increase penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. These regulations place new responsibilities on Big Tech companies, many of which are based in the state, to prioritize the well-being of their younger users.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury fashion brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe a total of over €157 million for violating EU competition rules. The commission found that the companies illegally restricted the ability of their independent retail partners to set their own prices, both online and in stores. By dictating minimum sales prices and maximum discount rates, the brands engaged in anti-competitive behavior that resulted in higher prices and reduced choice for consumers. The parent companies of the brands, including Kering and LVMH, were implicated in the decision.</p>

          <p>Meta is updating its content guidelines for Instagram to limit what teenage users can see to a level comparable with a PG-13 movie rating. The new policy will hide accounts that share sexualized content or media related to drugs and alcohol from teens, and they will no longer be able to follow such accounts. The company stated that this change is intended to provide parents with a clearer, more familiar standard for what their children are exposed to on the platform. The move comes as Meta continues to face criticism and regulatory pressure over child safety and the impact of its apps on youth mental health.</p>

          <p>Retired England cricketer Stuart Broad has claimed that Australia's current team is their weakest since 2010, the last time England won an Ashes series down under. Responding to predictions of a heavy England defeat, Broad argued that while Australia are favorites at home, they face significant question marks over their team composition and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. He believes this, combined with the strength of the current England squad, creates the potential for a highly competitive series. Broad suggests that the matchup is the most balanced it has been in over a decade.</p>
