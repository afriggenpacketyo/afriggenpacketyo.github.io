          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a thrilling Miami Grand Prix sprint race marked by wet-dry conditions and a safety car intervention. Oscar Piastri initially led the race after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but a timely pit stop for slick tires allowed Norris to gain the lead during a safety car period caused by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson. Max Verstappen, who initially finished fourth, received a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit stop release, demoting him to 17th place. This incident significantly hampered Antonelli's race, preventing him from making a timely pit stop and ultimately finishing out of the points. Optimism score: 70</p>

The news comes on World Press Freedom Day, and VOA staff are expected to begin a phased return to work.
