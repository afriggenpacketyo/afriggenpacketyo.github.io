          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu delivered a strong performance but was ultimately edged out by world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a classic three-hour match at the Cincinnati Open. Raducanu lost 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) in a tense battle that showcased her growing resilience and ability to challenge top-ranked players. Her performance is seen as a positive sign of her continued revival and improved fitness as she heads into the U.S. Open. The display of skill and composure suggests she is returning to the form that saw her win the Grand Slam title in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the South Park neighborhood, though a start date for construction remains uncertain. The project, proposed by a New York developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail, and parking for over 500 vehicles. Despite high demand for housing, developers face significant financial challenges, including high interest rates, rising labor costs, and new tariffs on materials. Still, the South Park area is considered a vibrant residential hub, and officials hope the project can move forward as market conditions improve.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger has launched an investigation into the recent $5 million auction of the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. The 54-pound meteorite was discovered in the Sahara Desert in Niger and sold at a record-setting auction in New York. Nigerien officials have labeled the situation as potential "illicit international trafficking" and suspended the export of all precious stones and meteorites. Sotheby's, the auction house, maintains that the rock was exported in line with all international procedures, creating a complex dispute over cultural and natural heritage.</p>

His pace and swing were crucial in the team's first win of the season, earning him player of the match honors and high praise from his captain, Phil Salt.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, effectively overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs decision would have applied a 39% tariff to certain gold bars imported from Switzerland and other countries, which are used to back futures contracts on the COMEX exchange. The initial ruling had sent gold prices to a record high and raised concerns about disrupting the international flow of the precious metal. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures promptly fell by over 2.4%.</p>

          <p>After pausing its initial public offering plans in April due to market volatility from new tariffs, ticketing marketplace StubHub is reportedly moving forward with a public debut next month. The company, which filed an updated prospectus, is expected to begin its IPO roadshow after Labor Day. StubHub reported 10% revenue growth in the first quarter to $397.6 million, though its net loss widened. The move comes as the IPO market shows signs of life after a prolonged quiet period, with StubHub aiming to compete in a crowded market against rivals like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats.

          <p>Ford has announced a multi-billion dollar plan to produce a competitively priced midsize electric pickup truck, aiming for a starting price in the $30,000 range within 18 months. The company will retool its Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant for the new vehicle platform, which will use lower-cost batteries from a Michigan facility. This move represents a strategic pivot for Ford towards more affordable EVs, a segment where Chinese automakers currently lead. The announcement comes amid political and market headwinds for the U.S. EV industry, but Ford's CEO insists the move is an essential bet on innovation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has extended a deadline to reimpose high tariffs on Chinese goods, delaying their implementation for another 90 days. An executive order signed by the president maintains the current, lower tariff rates until mid-November, a move that was anticipated following recent trade negotiations in Stockholm. This extension prevents U.S. duties on Chinese imports from reverting to their peak levels of 145%. The decision is the latest example of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused, altered, or delayed with little advance notice.</p>

The service, known for its distinctive connection sound, was a gateway to the online world for millions of households in the 1990s but has since been almost entirely replaced by broadband. At its peak in 2001, AOL had over 30 million subscribers, but by 2023, government estimates showed fewer than 300,000 people in the U.S. still used a dial-up connection.

The shutdown, caused by an expired permit, led to a 7% jump in shares for U.S. miner Albemarle and a 14% rise in a lithium miners ETF. Investors anticipate that the disruption will tighten the already constrained global supply of lithium, a critical component for electric vehicle batteries, and consequently drive up prices for the metal.
