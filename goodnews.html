          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's latest album, "Man's Best Friend," delves into her frustrations with her love life despite achieving superstardom with her previous hit record. The article describes the album as a shrewd and tangy collection of songs lampooning a gallery of disappointing men, from crybabies to the overly ambitious. Musically, the album continues her collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff, blending '70s AM-radio pop with touches of disco and country. While not every track is considered as sharp as her last album, it's praised for its wit and clever songwriting.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her American opponent, Taylor Townsend, after a US Open match. Following her loss, Ostapenko accused Townsend of having "no class" and "no education," escalating tensions that began over a disputed net cord incident. In her apology, Ostapenko explained that English is not her first language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, not Townsend's general education. She acknowledged that her words could have been offensive and expressed her commitment to learning and growing as a person.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a lack of uniform international rules, pediatricians and psychologists are providing consensus-based principles for children's screen time, emphasizing caution and developmental stages. The general recommendation is to be screen-free until age three, allowing toddlers to explore the physical world and develop self-control. For kindergarten-aged children, limited and supervised screen time is advised to encourage imagination and social interaction. As children get older, the focus shifts from time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication to navigate the digital world safely and prevent social exclusion.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is experiencing a career resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, where he had limited playing time. In Everton's recent 3-2 win at Wolverhampton, Grealish delivered another man-of-the-match performance, contributing two assists and showcasing the creative spark his new team needed. Everton manager David Moyes praised the player, suggesting he is "even better than I thought" and is benefiting from consistent game time and feeling valued. His impressive form has reignited discussions about his potential return to the England national team.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Coco Gauff delivered a confident performance to defeat Magdalena Frech 6-3, 6-1, advancing to the fourth round of the US Open for the fourth consecutive year. After two tense and emotional opening matches, Gauff appeared more settled, particularly with her serve, which has been a source of inconsistency recently. The victory sets up a highly anticipated match against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka. Gauff noted that she felt "a lot lighter" on the court, suggesting she has moved past the pressure that affected her in the earlier rounds.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump made his first public appearance after unfounded rumors of his death trended on social media. He was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia, effectively quelling the online speculation. The rumors appear to have been sparked by recent comments from his running mate, J.D. Vance, who spoke about being prepared to step in should a tragedy occur. This incident follows earlier public concerns about Trump's health after a bruise was seen on his hand, which the White House attributed to frequent handshaking.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, Hamburg's Astra St. Pauli Brewery has partnered with the condiment company Hela to create a beer inspired by the city's classic street food, the Currywurst. The new limited-edition brew, named "Currydurst" (Currythirst), infuses a 6.5% alcohol beer with the spicy and smoky flavor of Hela's iconic curry ketchup. The product is a homage to the local culture of the St. Pauli district, where the sausage snack is often enjoyed with an Astra beer. Only 2,000 liters of this unconventional beverage will be produced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dealt a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration agenda by blocking the expanded use of expedited removal for deportations. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's policy of applying this streamlined process to migrants in the interior of the country, often with little due process, is unlawful. Previously, expedited removal was typically restricted to recent arrivals near the border. The judge's opinion emphasized that the government cannot deprive individuals of a meaningful opportunity to disprove allegations of unlawful entry without proper legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths.

Mayor Eric Adams stated that while the immediate risk has passed, the city will implement new measures to improve detection and response for future potential clusters.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. Researchers in the UK used the device, which analyzes subtle sounds the human ear cannot hear and records an ECG, on over 12,000 patients across 96 GP surgeries. The AI tool significantly improved detection rates for all three conditions compared to practices using traditional methods. Experts believe this technology could be a "real game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>
