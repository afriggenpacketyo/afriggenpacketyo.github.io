          <p>Air quality in the eastern United States is expected to improve after being significantly impacted by smoke from Canadian wildfires. The smoke created unhealthy air quality conditions from the upper Midwest to New York City. While conditions are improving, officials still advise residents, especially those with respiratory issues, to limit strenuous outdoor activities. The recent event highlights the increasing impact of wildfires on air quality across large regions.</p>

          <p>Amazon has created a new group within its consumer product-development arm, Lab126, focused on agentic artificial intelligence. The team will develop an agentic AI "framework" for use in robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI." These systems will enable robots to understand and act on natural language commands, transforming warehouse robots into versatile assistants. Amazon's AI lab released a web browser-based agent earlier this year, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group.</p>
