          <p>Several prominent banks, including the American Bankers Association and Nomura, express strong support for President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," anticipating a significant boost to the U.S. economy. They highlight the bill's sweeping tax reforms and targeted incentives as crucial for averting a sharp fiscal contraction and encouraging corporate investment, especially as many provisions from the 2017 tax bill are set to expire by the end of 2025. While credit agencies and critics warn the bill could add at least $3 trillion to the federal deficit, proponents believe it offers much-needed tax relief and an economic tailwind. Citi strategists also project the bill, alongside new trade deals, will improve overall growth sentiment in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philip Lane, the European Central Bank's chief economist, has stated that the institution's recent period of monetary tightening is "done," successfully bringing inflation down from a peak of 10% to its 2% target. Speaking at the ECB's annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, Lane emphasized the central bank's commitment to remaining data-dependent while assuring that it would not overreact to isolated "blips" in future inflation figures. The euro zone's inflation rate for May came in at 1.9%, just below the central bank's 2% target, and its key interest rate has been cut to 2%, with money market pricing suggesting expectations for a further quarter-point trim by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences‚Äô Aerospace Information Research Institute have developed an optimized model utilizing satellite data to precisely monitor carbon dioxide emissions from coal power plants. This significant breakthrough offers a standardized method for global carbon accounting, a crucial element currently lacking in international efforts. The study demonstrates the substantial potential for satellite remote sensing technology in accurately estimating CO2 emissions, enabling retrospective analysis of historical data to detect anomalous emission events. This innovative framework could also be effectively applied to monitor emissions from other major industrial sources, such as oil and gas fields or steel plants, contributing to more robust environmental oversight.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex question of how much money individuals need to save for retirement, emphasizing that the answer varies greatly depending on personal aspirations and desired lifestyles. It highlights challenges in setting national pension policies due to these diverse retirement goals, a problem the government is grappling with in its Pension Review. The Hargreaves Lansdown Savings and Resilience Barometer analyzed various measures of adequacy, including "pounds and pence" benchmarks like the Living Pension, and "relative measures" such as target replacement rates based on pre-retirement earnings. The research found that relying solely on fixed "pounds and pence" targets might mislead both lower and higher earners regarding their actual retirement preparedness. (not investment advice)</p>

It highlights the profound impact of finally seeing French-set stories, such as Simon Mouta√Ørou's "No Chains No Masters," which focuses on the marronage of enslaved people, and Jean-Claude Barny's biopic "Fanon," about the Martinican psychiatrist Frantz Fanon. The article argues that despite a rich history of colonial oppression and its ongoing effects in former colonies, these compelling narratives remain largely marginalized in mainstream French public space. However, it notes that new films like "Zion" are gaining public success, indicating audiences are ready to confront this history, despite the cinema industry's slowness.</p>

The Wall Street investment bank forecasts the yuan to break the 7 per dollar level in six months and 6.9 in 12 months, reflecting fading confidence in U.S. economic exceptionalism, loose fiscal policies, and rising long-term financing costs.

Panelists agreed that the digitally savvy ASEAN region is particularly well-positioned for this.

          <p>China's factory activity unexpectedly returned to growth in June, according to a private Caixin/S&P Global survey, with its manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.4. This contrasts with the official PMI, which showed contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey coverage and timing, with the Caixin survey focusing on export-oriented firms. The expansion was largely supported by increased production due to "better trade conditions and promotional activities," despite new export orders declining for a third month. However, employment remained bleak, and intensifying price wars weighed on profit margins, tempering overall business optimism as the "external environment remains severe and complex."

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through "transformative" housing legislation, significantly reforming the state's environmental review standards to accelerate construction. The new laws, Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, exempt most urban housing projects and several nonresidential facilities from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a process often causing years of delays and litigation. Newsom employed a "poison pill" provision in the state budget to ensure the bills' passage, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. Experts believe these reforms could be the most significant to CEQA in its 55-year history, immediately impacting development and allowing numerous projects to proceed.</p>

Designed by architect Eric Owen Moss, the studio aims to foster creativity and support artists, serving as an anchor for a global network of creative hubs, with more planned worldwide.
