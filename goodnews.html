          <p>Southeast Asian leaders met in Kuala Lumpur to discuss the impact of new U.S. tariffs on regional economies. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed concern over the strain on the global trading system due to the tariffs imposed by the United States. He proposed an ASEAN-U.S. meeting to negotiate the tariffs and the leaders showed their deep concern over "unilateral tariff measures." The leaders also discussed the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and East Timor's accession to ASEAN.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office downplayed an incident in which his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon their arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam. Video footage showed Brigitte's hands on Macron's face, giving it a shove, leading to online speculation. Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the images before confirming they were genuine, with Macron later stating they were just joking around. The incident occurred as Macron began a Southeast Asian tour to promote France as a reliable alternative to the U.S. and China amid trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sexual orientation is a complex trait determined during puberty through an interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, according to experts. It is not a choice but rather a stable aspect of identity that develops in adolescence, influenced by hormones and personal preferences. Researchers have explored genetic, hormonal, and sociocultural factors to understand its development, finding no single cause. The diversity of human sexuality is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and sexual orientation is not a disease or unnatural, but societal norms often lead to exclusion and persecution of non-heterosexual individuals.</p>

Starting Wednesday, passengers will be charged to check bags, a departure from the airline's tradition of offering this perk. This move comes as baggage fees generate substantial revenue for U.S. airlines, and Southwest aims to increase its revenue streams. In addition to charging for checked bags, Southwest is also introducing basic-economy tickets and eliminating open seating, aligning with industry trends.</p>

Khipus, knotted cords used to record information, hold the potential to unlock new knowledge about the Inca civilization. The article details Hyland's journey to Jucul, the challenges of unraveling and deciphering the khipus, and the collaborative efforts of scholars using linguistics, statistics, and AI to make progress in understanding these ancient records.

          <p>The Kremlin has denied any involvement in alleged arson attacks at properties connected to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, dismissing the claims as "ludicrous" and "groundless." This denial follows media reports suggesting that UK security officials are investigating a potential link to Russia after three incidents earlier this month. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that London tends to suspect Russia of involvement in all negative events in Great Britain, but these suspicions lack evidence. Three individuals, including two Ukrainian nationals and one Romanian man, have been charged in connection with the police investigation into the attacks.</p>

          <p>Lukas Furtenbach, a renowned mountain guide, asserts that using xenon gas treatment and advanced technology makes climbing Mount Everest faster, safer, and more environmentally friendly. Furtenbach's team achieved a record-breaking ascent using this method, but the use of xenon gas has sparked controversy and an investigation by Nepalese mountaineering authorities. Furtenbach defends the practice, stating that it aims to protect climbers from high altitude sickness and reduce environmental impact by shortening the time spent on the mountain. The guide says the ability to climb the peak in a short period of time could also lead to less environmental impact on the mountain.</p>

His design blends the vertical take-off capabilities of a helicopter with the long-range flight of an airplane. Taylor hopes his design will enable first responders, researchers, and everyday problem solvers to access this type of drone, which combines the multi-rotor helicopter style with the fixed wings of an airplane.</p>
