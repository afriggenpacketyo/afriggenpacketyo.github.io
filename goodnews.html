          <p>Adrian Ramsay, current co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a joint leadership bid with Ellie Chowns, MP for North Herefordshire, as Carla Denyer will not seek re-election. Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its "most ambitious chapter yet," focusing on national politics and winning power across the country. They join deputy leader Zack Polanski in the leadership race, who is campaigning on building a "mass movement" to counter Reform UK. The Green Party achieved its best-ever result in the 2024 general election, winning seats in four constituencies and increasing its number of councillors for the eighth consecutive year.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a student-led movement is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking the largest and most extensive protest movement the country has seen. Sparked by a train station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16 people, believed to be due to corruption, the protests have spread across the country. The government's attempts to quell the unrest, including the resignation of the prime minister and offers of loans to young people, have failed to deter the demonstrators. Protesters are calling for early elections, demonstrating a united front against the current regime.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, who was kidnapped in 2023, with Donald Trump confirming the news. The release is expected to occur on Tuesday and requires a temporary ceasefire and halt to drone flights over Gaza to ensure Alexander's safe departure. Israel has not committed to a ceasefire or prisoner release but agreed to a safe corridor for Alexander. Negotiations for the remaining hostages are expected to follow, and the governments of Qatar and Egypt view the release as a positive step toward resuming ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to its rightful owner, resolving a long-standing dispute. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. The return concludes a legal battle that began when a South Korean temple claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, a claim rejected by South Korea's Supreme Court in 2023.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses and adult dependents of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also face restrictions on recruiting staff from abroad. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that new immigrants must earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK, prioritizing residency for those who pay taxes, work in public service, or volunteer. These measures come as the government seeks to address concerns about rising legal migration and counter the influence of Reform UK. The white paper also aims to tighten legislation regarding asylum claims under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have indicated they have made progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with both sides describing the discussions as "productive and constructive." The White House called it a "trade deal" but did not elaborate on specifics. The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, raised hopes for a de-escalation of trade tensions. Experts anticipate potential tariff cuts, although some remain cautious, suggesting an agreement to continue discussions is more likely. The announcement boosted stock markets and strengthened the Chinese yuan against the US dollar.</p>
