          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed online orders after a cyberattack in April disrupted services and impacted profits, but the retailer is still working to fully restore its online operations. Shoppers can now purchase fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products to follow. The cyberattack, which affected click and collect services and contactless payments, is estimated to cost the company around ¬£300 million in profits. While some customer data was stolen, M&S assures that payment details and passwords were not compromised, though some customers report limited stock availability and delayed communication.</p>

          <p>With millions of Americans struggling with unpaid medical debt, experts suggest exploring debt relief options such as credit counseling, debt settlement, and debt management plans. Credit counseling offers budget and payment prioritization assistance, while debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to reduce the owed amount. Debt management plans consolidate debt repayment through a provider, potentially streamlining the process. Experts also advise negotiating directly with healthcare providers, inquiring about financial assistance programs, and scrutinizing bills for errors, while cautioning against using credit cards or loans to cover medical expenses.

          <p>Eurostar has announced plans to launch direct train services from London to Frankfurt and Geneva by the early 2030s, investing in a fleet of up to 50 new trains. The new services aim to meet strong demand for train travel across Europe, reducing travel time between London and Frankfurt to about five hours, and to Geneva in approximately five hours and 20 minutes. However, the expansion hinges on securing sufficient space at its depot in east London, which is also being sought by other firms looking to operate services between London and mainland Europe. The Office of Rail and Road is currently reviewing proposals to determine depot usage, potentially impacting Eurostar's expansion plans.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has proposed selling U.S.-made cars in Japan through its domestic dealership network to support trade negotiations with the United States. The initiative aims to address the U.S. trade deficit, a key concern for President Trump, by increasing imports of American-made vehicles. Chairman Akio Toyoda informed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Toyota's willingness to sell vehicles manufactured by U.S. automakers through its extensive network of stores in Japan. This proposal comes amid ongoing tariff disputes, including U.S. tariffs on automobiles and Japan's concerns over Trump's reciprocal tariff regime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce executive orders that would block grant funding to groups promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or acknowledging transgender people. The judge stated that the executive orders infringe on constitutionally protected speech and services, arguing that the president cannot use congressionally appropriated funds to target protected communities. The ruling will remain in effect during the legal case, though the government is likely to appeal. The plaintiffs, including health centers and LGBTQ+ services groups, argued that the executive orders would prevent them from fulfilling their missions.</p>

          <p>The United States risks undermining its soft power by alienating Chinese students, despite resuming the processing of student and exchange visitor visas. The Trump administration's visa restrictions have sent mixed messages, with President Trump stating that the US loves to have Chinese students while also indicating that some students cause "troubles". These restrictions have disproportionately affected Chinese students, who constitute a significant portion of international enrollment at universities like Harvard. The situation highlights the delicate balance between national security concerns and maintaining the US as a welcoming destination for international students.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts warn that dirty hummingbird feeders can be deadly to the birds, as spoiled sugar water attracts harmful microbes that cause infections. These infections, such as candida, can cause the birds' tongues to swell, leading to starvation. Experts recommend cleaning feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in the summer, using hot water or a vinegar and water solution. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also suggested as an alternative or supplementary food source, ensuring a safe and healthy environment for the birds.</p>
