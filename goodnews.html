          <p>Los Angeles is facing challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovery from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential funding cuts from the Trump administration. The city is also anticipating a shortage of workers and supplies, raising concerns about its ability to deliver on ambitious promises made during the bid. Despite these obstacles, Mayor Karen Bass and Olympics organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman remain confident that the Games will be a success and a boost for the city. They point to the 1984 Olympics as an example of the city's ability to overcome economic challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, deeming the action unlawful under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred any future modifications, stating that the tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking did not address the threats outlined in the orders. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, but Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses, citing the tariffs' economic devastation.</p>

          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly pursuing naturalization. The surge in applications is driven by a desire for protection against deportation and a motivation to participate in upcoming congressional elections. Community organizations report a rise in demand for citizenship assistance and classes, highlighting the importance of civic engagement and safeguarding against potential policy changes. Academics note that this trend mirrors historical patterns, such as the increase in Latino voting following California's Proposition 187.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the United States through Biden-era programs. The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members and their relatives, and others, and it requires the government to restart processing applications for migrants renewing their status. Judge Talwani stated that the termination of legal pathways was likely unlawful and would cause chaos, and that it is not in the public interest to make hundreds of thousands of individuals unlawfully present in the country.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% increase in its data center business, leading to a 6% rise in stock trading. The company expects approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, though this guidance was reduced due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to the U.S. industry. Despite political tensions, Nvidia continues to grow aggressively, fueled by demand for its artificial intelligence chips.</p>

          <p>A federal judicial panel has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, ruling that he overstepped his authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not grant the president the power to tax imports from nearly every country. The ruling represents a setback for Trump's trade agenda, potentially undercutting his leverage in negotiations with other nations. The Trump administration plans to appeal the decision.</p>

These projects have been declared "nationally significant", allowing them to speed through the planning process, though they could still be over a decade away from opening. The reservoirs are intended to provide resilience to future droughts in a dry part of the country with high water demand, but the decision to override local objections could prove unpopular.
