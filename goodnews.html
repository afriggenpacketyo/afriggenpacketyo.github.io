          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" before launching missile strikes on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak." Trump's message suggests a pre-planned, calibrated retaliation to avoid escalation, and he noted that the missiles were largely intercepted with minimal damage or casualties. Following the strikes, Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. Diplomatic sources indicate that U.S. and Qatari officials prepared for the counterattack, suggesting a coordinated effort to manage the situation and prevent further conflict. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missile attacks on a U.S. base in Qatar, but President Trump characterized the response as "very weak" and claimed a ceasefire had been agreed upon. Trump suggested Iran had gotten it out of their "system" and expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire and hopes Iran will negotiate in earnest. The situation mirrors the 2020 targeted killing of Qasem Soleimani, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iranian retaliation. The optimism score for this article is 65.</p>
