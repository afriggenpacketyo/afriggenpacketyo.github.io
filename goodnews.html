        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively securing its supply chain resilience, particularly concerning rare earth minerals. In 2010, China's export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo incentivized Japan to reduce its reliance on Chinese minerals. Japan invested in stockpiling, recycling, alternative technologies, and non-China rare-earth projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has decreased from over 90% to below 60%, with plans to reduce it further to below 50% this year. (not investment advice)</p>
