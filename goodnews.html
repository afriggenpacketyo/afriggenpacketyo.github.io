        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter, expanding by 1.3% year-on-year, which is below the estimated 1.5% growth. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports. In response, the Reserve Bank of Australia previously lowered rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth, but the first-quarter GDP release may prompt further monetary policy easing. Despite these challenges, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index saw a rise following the GDP release, and the Australian dollar remained stable.</p>
