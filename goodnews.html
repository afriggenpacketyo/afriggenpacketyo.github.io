          <p>Sig Hansen, the veteran captain from the Discovery Channel series "Deadliest Catch," is reconsidering his retirement plans due to an increasing fear of death and a desire to spend more time with his family. The 59-year-old fisherman admitted that after decades on the treacherous Bering Sea, his perspective has shifted, citing the loss of fellow fishermen and his own health scares as major factors. While he is not ready to stop captaining the Northwestern immediately, he acknowledges that the call of home and his four grandchildren is growing stronger than the call of the sea.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to address the historical and ongoing racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the United States. The article highlights the legacy of segregation at public pools, which created barriers to access for Black Americans and contributed to a generational gap in swimming skills. Statistics from the CDC show Black children are significantly more likely to drown in pools than their White peers. By providing accessible lessons and scholarships, these programs aim to create a ripple effect, fostering more Black swim instructors and lifeguards to make aquatic spaces safer and more equitable for everyone.</p>

          <p>Global pop superstar Dua Lipa has officially been granted Kosovo citizenship in a ceremony hosted by President Vjosa Osmani. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has been a vocal advocate for the country, where she lived for a period as a child and co-founded the Sunny Hill Festival. President Osmani praised her as an iconic cultural figure, and Lipa expressed that the citizenship "completes the duality" she has always felt. This marks her third citizenship, alongside British and Albanian, further cementing her deep ties to the Balkan region.</p>

          <h2>Florida Overtakes California in Utility-Scale Solar Growth Despite Policy Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 12:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar energy, driven primarily by major utility companies like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop panels. The growth is fueled by favorable economics, as solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval of projects under 75 megawatts. However, this momentum faces headwinds from new federal legislation signed by President Trump, which accelerates the rollback of solar tax credits and is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state's ability to maintain its solar leadership will depend on navigating these policy changes and addressing growing grid constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a stunning turn of events, Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc claimed a surprise pole position for the Hungarian Grand Prix, narrowly beating out the favored McLaren duo of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Leclerc, who had not shown pole-winning pace earlier in the weekend, delivered a remarkable final lap in tricky, windy conditions to secure the top spot by just 0.026 seconds. The result was a shock for both Ferrari and McLaren, with Leclerc himself expressing disbelief over the achievement. Meanwhile, championship contender Max Verstappen struggled, qualifying in eighth place for Red Bull.</p>

          <p>The head of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), Dr. Wajid Akhter, has stated that Muslims must take a leading role in the artificial intelligence revolution or risk being marginalized. In a leaked video from a recent conference, he warned that the community cannot afford to miss the AI revolution as it did with the industrial, computer, and social media eras. Dr. Akhter also spoke about the collective pain over the situation in Gaza, framing it as a call for unity. His comments come as the British government appears to be easing its long-standing "non-engagement" policy with the MCB.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that tailoring fitness routines to individual personality types can enhance enjoyment and adherence to exercise. Researchers found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group workouts like HIIT and team sports, while conscientious individuals are drawn to goal-oriented activities like marathon training. The study also suggests that people prone to anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, and those with open and agreeable personalities enjoy varied and fun options like Zumba or rock climbing. This approach encourages finding a suitable activity rather than forcing an unenjoyable one.</p>

          <p>In his new HBO Max special, "Panicked," comedian Marc Maron continues to explore themes of personal anxiety and societal decay with his signature confrontational and ruminative style. The article reviews the special as the third part of a loose trilogy, where Maron grapples with everything from his cat's health issues to the rise of fascism and his father's dementia. Maron uses these topics, including his own potential childhood sexual trauma, not for simple confession but as a springboard for sharp, funny, and deeply reflective commentary.
