          <p>After weeks of anticipation, Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken its first flight from the nest. The flight occurred around 8:27 a.m. local time, with Gizmo initially flapping its wings on a branch before soaring into the air. Gizmo, who is nearly 13 weeks old, had been practicing for this moment, along with its sister Sunny, who took her first flight earlier in the week. While the eaglets will eventually venture off on their own, they are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months, frequently returning to the nest during this transitional period. The event marks a significant milestone in the lives of these young bald eagles.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team, under new head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, completed a clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side in both T20 and one-day international series. While the series win provides a positive start, it's important to note that England has historically dominated home bilateral series, often faltering on the bigger stage. Tougher tests lie ahead, with India's arrival and the upcoming 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka presenting significant challenges. It remains to be seen whether this "new" England can perform under pressure when it truly matters.</p>

          <p>To be considered in the top 1% of wealth for Americans in their 60s, a net worth of at least $11 million is typically required. This figure is significantly higher than the median net worth for those in their late 60s and early 70s, which is around $266,400. The high threshold reflects the need to cover daily living expenses, medical costs, and the impact of inflation on purchasing power. A diversified portfolio, including a primary home, rental properties, retirement accounts, and investments, is common among those in this wealth bracket (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is set to return to Reform UK in a new role leading the party's "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf had previously stated that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time." Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed his delight at Yusuf's return, noting that Yusuf will now take on a more public role for the party, appearing more frequently in the media. Yusuf cited exhaustion and the urge to reconsider after a large number of messages from party members as the reasons for his return.</p>

Gonsolin, who underwent Tommy John surgery and missed all of 2024, had made seven starts this season before the setback. This move further complicates the Dodgers' pitching situation, as they are already missing several key starters due to injuries. The team is now considering options to fill Gonsolin's spot in the rotation, including Dustin May and Matt Sauer.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring, reversing earlier cuts made by the council. The deal ensures that funds will be identified within 90 days to hire an additional 240 police recruits. This agreement comes after the council approved a budget that reduced the number of police officers hired, prompting concerns from the mayor. The restoration of police hiring reflects a commitment to public safety and emergency response in Los Angeles.</p>

The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs, many of whom were toy poodle mixes, pomeranians, and chihuahuas, and are providing them with medical care. The homeowner surrendered the dogs, as well as 21 chickens, and it remains unclear whether they will face charges.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians are turning to the politics of remembrance, with three new initiatives aimed at recognizing and healing historical injustices. These include the posthumous promotion of Alfred Dreyfus, recognition and compensation for returnees from French Indochina, and a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt." While these symbolic gestures have been met with mixed interpretations, they highlight a willingness to take historical responsibility and address past wrongs. However, some critics argue that these initiatives are easier to pass than structural reforms in areas such as pensions and education.</p>
