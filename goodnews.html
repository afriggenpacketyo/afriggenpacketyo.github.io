          <p>Following two days of high-level trade talks in Stockholm, the United States and China have agreed to extend a mutual pause on imposing new tariffs on each other's imports. While no major breakthroughs were announced, officials from both nations expressed satisfaction with the progress made. China's Vice-Minister of Commerce, Li Chenggang, confirmed the agreement to continue the suspension of reciprocal tariffs. This development suggests a temporary de-escalation in the ongoing trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, though the duration of the extension was not specified.</p>

          <p>Boeing has significantly reduced its quarterly losses, signaling a potential turnaround for the aerospace giant which has faced numerous crises. The company's revenue jumped 35% as it delivered the highest number of airplanes in a quarter since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism, stating that 2025 could be the company's "turnaround year" if it maintains its focus on safety and stability. While challenges remain, including delays in certifying new 737 MAX models, the improved performance and increased production rates are positive signs for its recovery.</p>

          <p>During a visit to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Donald Trump held a meeting with Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The leaders discussed the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, with Swinney appealing for an exemption for the key Scottish export. They also touched upon the humanitarian situation in Gaza and North Sea oil and gas taxation, which Trump had earlier criticized as being too high. Swinney described the conversation as positive and expressed hope for progress on the tariff issue before Trump's next state visit to the UK.</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single railroad system to span the entire United States from coast to coast. The companies argue the merger would streamline national deliveries by removing handoff delays between their respective networks in the West and East. However, the proposal is expected to face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for railroad consolidation due to past service disruptions. The move could also pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads to pursue their own mergers to remain competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eloghosa Osunde's new novel, "Necessary Fiction," is explored as a potential remedy for the modern "loneliness epidemic." The book centers on a group of queer Nigerian characters who, after being alienated from their biological families, form their own supportive community. This article suggests that the novel's depiction of "chosen family" offers a powerful model for building meaningful connections based on intention rather than inherited obligation. By focusing on kinship as a deliberate act of love and loyalty, the story provides a vision for how people can combat isolation in an increasingly atomized world.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and proactive government measures. The organization now projects global growth of 3.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, an increase from its April predictions. The IMF noted that a surge in U.S. imports, as firms rushed to beat impending taxes, contributed to the upward revision. Despite the improved outlook, the IMF warned that the potential for higher tariffs and increased uncertainty could still lead to weaker economic activity in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

If finalized, the deal would see the nation's largest credit card issuer absorb the high-profile portfolio, further cementing its dominance in the market. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the business would mark the end of a challenging venture into consumer credit that was marked by high growth but also significant losses and regulatory scrutiny.

          <p>Prominent American mining entrepreneur Robert Friedland has voiced his approval for the incoming 50% tariff on copper imports into the United States. The billionaire founder of Ivanhoe Mines told the BBC that the import tax would be beneficial for re-establishing the domestic copper mining industry and strengthening national security. Friedland argues that the policy correctly focuses on ensuring the U.S. has stable access to critical raw materials rather than relying on foreign sources. This perspective contrasts with critics who warn that such tariffs will be inflationary and raise costs for consumers and manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from Çatalhöyük, a Neolithic settlement in modern-day Turkey, confirms that the society was organized around women. Researchers analyzed DNA from remains buried under houses and found that individuals were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This finding supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The evidence suggests that women held an elevated status in one of the world's oldest urban settlements.</p>
