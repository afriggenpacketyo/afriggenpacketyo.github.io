          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully synthesized high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare form of diamond, first discovered in an Arizona meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to form under intense heat and pressure. The researchers were able to create pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometers in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and overcoming a long-standing challenge that had stumped scientific teams worldwide.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders made a notable NFL preseason debut, drawing praise from figures like LeBron James for his performance against the Carolina Panthers. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns, demonstrating significant poise and leading three touchdown drives. Despite entering the game fourth on the depth chart, his strong showing could improve his standing in what is considered an open competition for the team's quarterback positions, though coach Kevin Stefanski remained noncommittal about future roles.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by the negative experiences and mental toll of dating apps, 30-year-old Londoner Lucy Rout founded Haystack Dating, an events company designed to foster in-person connections. Rout, who experienced "dating burnout" from ghosting and bad behavior online, uses an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on interests and personality for an initial activity before a larger social gathering. The venture taps into a growing trend of people moving away from apps like Tinder and Hinge, seeking more accountable and meaningful real-life interactions.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he is eight to ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as a significant "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery came during a genetic test for his National Geographic show, revealing he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, a strong risk factor for the brain disorder. The 41-year-old actor stated the news prompted him to re-evaluate his purpose, focusing more on what he contributes rather than collects, and to become more invested in living a healthier, more meaningful life.</p>

          <p>In an era of economic uncertainty, consumers are increasingly embracing "treatonomics," a trend of spending on both small 'pick-me-ups' and larger, experience-based luxuries to boost morale. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," sees people cutting back on daily basics while splurging on items like collectibles or expensive concert tickets for a sense of joy and self-expression. Analysts note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership becoming less attainable for many, consumers are instead celebrating smaller moments, driving this resilient and growing retail trend.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain but was quickly extinguished by firefighters, preventing a potential catastrophe. The blaze reportedly started in a chapel within the Almanzor naves, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The swift intervention of three fire teams controlled the flames, and crews remained on site to cool the structure. The monument, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a jewel of Islamic architecture that was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century.</p>

          <h2>Disney and Gina Carano Settle Lawsuit Over Her Firing from 'The Mandalorian'</h2>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled the lawsuit she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her controversial social media posts. While details are private, a Lucasfilm statement praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future work, a reversal from its previous condemnation of her posts as "abhorrent." This article argues the settlement was appropriate, viewing her initial firing as a fearful overreaction to a social media mob, and distinguishes this case from what it calls more concerning instances of corporate capitulation to political pressure.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, aiming to end decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the deal involves a permanent cessation of fighting and the establishment of diplomatic and business relations between the two nations. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will help develop a major transit corridor, named the "Trump Route," connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, a key point of contention in past negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit, the world's best-selling van, is celebrating its 60th anniversary since first rolling off the production line on August 9, 1965. Originally a revelation for its space, power, and comfort, the Transit became a staple for tradespeople, a tour vehicle for iconic rock bands, and notoriously, a getaway vehicle for bank robbers. While production moved from the UK to Turkey in 2013, Ford's British heritage remains in its design and engineering centers, which are now focused on the van's electric and software-defined future.</p>

          <p>An unexpected friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a conservative, and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, a prominent left-wing politician. Vance is currently on a personal holiday in the UK, staying with Lammy at his official country residence, where the two have bonded over shared experiences of faith, family, and challenging upbringings. Despite their vast political differences and past criticisms of Donald Trump, their relationship is seen as a potentially valuable diplomatic channel, particularly given the personalized nature of the current U.S. administration's foreign policy.</p>
