          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the expulsion of over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend. Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return, citing a Guatemalan government report that many families were surprised by the effort. The decision upholds legal protections for unaccompanied minors who enter the U.S.</p>

          <p>Scientists have announced the first discovery of prehistoric insects preserved in amber in South America, providing a rare look at life on Earth 112 million years ago. The specimens, found in a quarry in Ecuador, include ancient beetles, flies, and wasps from the era when flowering plants were beginning to dominate the landscape. This finding is significant as nearly all other major amber deposits are from the Northern Hemisphere. The discovery helps fill a crucial gap in understanding the co-evolution of insects and plants in the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, joined by seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, for engaging in "illegal" ticket resale tactics. The lawsuit alleges that the companies colluded with scalpers, allowing them to unlawfully purchase large quantities of tickets, which drives up prices for consumers and harms artists. The FTC claims Ticketmaster effectively "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets, generating billions from resold tickets and frustrating efforts to keep prices affordable.</p>

          <p>This article explores the teachings of 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza as a tool for managing the emotional impact of public criticism and "cancel culture." Despite being condemned for his ideas during his lifetime, Spinoza developed a method of using reason to understand and regulate emotions, a process now known as metacognition. The article suggests practical steps based on his philosophy, such as pausing before reacting and analyzing one's feelings objectively, to achieve equanimity and respond with dignity rather than being controlled by fear or anger.</p>

While acknowledging that some within the administration, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had advocated for a larger half-point reduction, Hassett framed the smaller cut as a "good first step." This measured response contrasts with President Trump's previous aggressive criticism of the central bank, suggesting a temporary alignment on the direction of monetary policy.

          <p>Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have identified a "mileage clock" in the brain that helps both rats and humans estimate the distance they have traveled. By recording the brain activity of rats running in an arena, they found specific cells that fired in a regular pattern corresponding to the distance covered. When the environment was altered, this pattern became erratic, causing the rats to misjudge distances. A similar experiment with human volunteers showed the same behavioral pattern, providing new insights into the brain's internal navigation system.</p>
