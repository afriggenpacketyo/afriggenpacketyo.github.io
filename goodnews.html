          <p>Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has been elected as the president of the UN General Assembly, securing 167 votes in a secret ballot held in New York. Baerbock, who was the sole candidate, expressed her desire to serve as an "honest broker" for the General Assembly. Her inauguration is scheduled for September 9, just before the General Assembly's annual meeting, where she will assume the largely ceremonial role. The election highlights Germany's continued involvement in international diplomacy and the UN's ongoing efforts to address global challenges. The new president is expected to bring a fresh perspective to the General Assembly's proceedings. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are anticipated to speak in the coming days, according to a senior White House official. This discussion follows recent tensions between Washington and Beijing that threaten to disrupt a tentative trade agreement reached weeks earlier. The official indicated that the leaders could communicate one-on-one imminently, though likely not today. The expected conversation aims to address ongoing trade disputes and reaffirm commitments to the previously established agreement. The call between the two leaders may ease market uncertainty and foster renewed optimism regarding trade relations. </p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners of war, focusing on those severely wounded, under the age of 25, and the remains of deceased soldiers, following negotiations in Istanbul. Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov stated that the agreement includes an all-for-all exchange of seriously wounded and sick prisoners, as well as young soldiers aged 18 to 25, and the return of 6,000 bodies of fallen soldiers. Vladimir Medinsky, the lead Russian negotiator, confirmed the agreement and indicated Russia plans to swap at least 1,000 soldiers. Russia also proposed a two to three-day ceasefire in specific areas to allow commanders to collect the bodies of their soldiers. </p>

          <p>Stocks of major U.S. steel companies experienced a significant surge after President Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum. Cleveland-Cliffs saw an increase of 25.2% in early morning trading, while Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics also rose by 10%. The tariff increase, from 25% to 50%, is slated to take effect on June 4, raising concerns about potential price hikes for consumers on products like cars and appliances. The European Union has announced it is preparing countermeasures against the United States in response to the higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a downward trend across Europe. The increase was primarily driven by sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, with 2,600 units sold last month. While Tesla's European sales have recently suffered due to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, Norway's EV incentives and the Model Y's popularity have fueled the rebound. Despite this, a recent survey indicates that political reasons influence car brand choices for many Norwegian EV drivers. </p>

          <p>Blake Snell, a pitcher for the Dodgers currently on the injured list, holds the record for the highest strikeout rate per nine innings in baseball history, averaging 11.1679. This statistic surpasses Chris Sale, who is second all-time at 11.1056, and may explain why the Dodgers signed Snell to a five-year, $182 million contract last offseason. Despite his high strikeout rate, Snell has a history of injuries, currently sidelined with left shoulder inflammation since April 6. The article also notes that many of the top pitchers in terms of strikeouts per innings are active players, reflecting changes in how pitchers are utilized in modern baseball. </p>

          <p>Mount Etna, located on the Italian island of Sicily, has erupted, spewing hot ash and lava, according to Italy's volcano monitoring body. The volcano department noted "explosions of increasing intensity" and reported that the "explosive activity from the Southeast Crater has become a lava fountain." There were no immediate reports of any risk to the local population or air travel, as the area is accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions. Mount Etna is considered the most active volcano in Europe and the most active stratovolcano in the world. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed spending bill could bring four major changes for student loan borrowers, including fewer repayment plans, new borrowing limits, removal of deferment and forbearance options, and limits on future changes to repayment. Future federal borrowers would have only two repayment options: an updated standard repayment plan and a new income-based plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). The bill would also set borrowing caps for undergraduates, graduates, and parents, while eliminating subsidized loans. The proposal aims to simplify the repayment process and control the rising cost of student loans. (not investment advice)</p>
