          <p>George Simion, a nationalist candidate, secured a significant victory in the first round of Romania's presidential election, leading with 40% of the vote. The election, a rerun after the annulment of the initial results due to fraud allegations, is being closely watched by European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance in supporting Ukraine. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, advocates for a strong NATO presence while also expressing concerns about financial support for Ukrainian refugees. The upcoming runoff on May 18 will determine Romania's future direction and its relationship with key international players, with the Trump administration reassessing its commitment to Romania.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing has become a popular option for women to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures increasing significantly in recent years. The process involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by surgical retrieval and cryopreservation. While it offers women more control over their reproductive timelines, egg freezing is expensive, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus annual storage fees and additional expenses for thawing and fertilization. Experts emphasize that it is essential to have realistic expectations and be aware of the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the procedure.</p>
