          <p>Kim Kardashian sparked considerable online debate with her fashion choice at the fifth annual Academy Museum Gala. She appeared in a nude-colored, strapless corseted gown from Maison Margiela, which was paired with a matching mask that completely obscured her face. The unconventional look generated a wide range of reactions on social media, with some users criticizing it as strange and distracting, while others praised the reality star for her bold and artistic decision. Kardashian herself seemed to poke fun at the ensemble in a video with her makeup artist.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter utilized her dual role as host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live" to cleverly address criticism surrounding her provocative public image and album art. Through sketches, including one where she played an oblivious designer of a risqué-looking pillow, she playfully pushed back against the idea that her sexuality is a problem. The performance was framed as a satirical response to the controversy over her album "Man's Best Friend," which some critics found regressive. Carpenter's appearance served to reassert control over her own narrative with comedic self-awareness.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team clinched a place in the World Cup semi-finals after a dramatic four-run victory against co-hosts India. Chasing 289, India appeared on track for a win but a late-game collapse, triggered by the dismissal of opener Smriti Mandhana, allowed England to regain control. Heather Knight's century was the cornerstone of England's total of 288-8. The tense finish saw England's bowlers hold their nerve in the final over, securing a crucial win in a high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>Following a week of meetings with top CEOs in San Francisco, market analyst Jim Cramer shared ten key investment takeaways. He noted that Salesforce's AI platform is showing real-world utility, potentially boosting its stock, while skepticism grows around OpenAI's consumer-focused spending. Cramer also emphasized that the AI chip market is not a zero-sum game, with room for Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to thrive. He advised caution on nuclear and quantum computing stocks, which he views as overhyped, but expressed optimism for Meta's smart glasses and Levi Strauss's new growth path.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams concluded their extended road trip with a decisive 35-7 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium in London. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns, three of which were to receiver Davante Adams, leading the team to a 5-2 record heading into their bye week. Even without injured star receiver Puka Nacua, the Rams' offense was effective, while the defense, led by rookies Jared Verse and Byron Young, recorded seven sacks on Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence.

          <p>While tobacco consumption has significantly decreased in Southeast Asia over the past two decades due to strong public health policies, the region is now grappling with the rising popularity of e-cigarettes. A World Health Organization report highlighted a drop in smoking prevalence from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, thanks to measures like higher taxes and advertising bans. However, this success is being challenged by vaping, particularly among adolescents. Countries are divided on how to respond, with nations like Thailand and Singapore banning e-cigarettes outright, while others, such as Malaysia, face political resistance to stricter regulations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers in two income-driven repayment plans, following a legal challenge by the American Federation of Teachers. The Department of Education will again cancel debt for eligible participants in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans, which it had previously blocked. This decision reopens a path to debt relief for millions of borrowers who were left in limbo. The agreement also clarified that forgiveness granted in 2025 will not be subject to federal taxes.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has indicated that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills as part of its response to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he did not confirm a specific policy ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The suggestion comes as the government faces pressure to reduce high energy costs, which have remained elevated since the 2021 price spike. Scrapping the tax could save the average household approximately £86 per year.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the newly elected leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has defended his party's proposal for a wealth tax, framing it as a crucial tool for "tackling the deep inequality in our society." The policy would impose an annual tax of 1% on assets over £10 million and 2% on those over £1 billion. Speaking to the BBC, Polanski argued that while the tax would raise funds, its primary goal is to create a more equitable society by placing the largest burden on those with the "broadest shoulders." He also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the financial decision of whether to roll over a 401(k) into an annuity, a choice often faced by retirees seeking stable income. While an annuity can provide guaranteed lifetime payments and eliminate stock market risk, it comes with significant trade-offs, including high fees, loss of flexibility, and limited growth potential. The decision hinges on an individual's risk tolerance, existing income sources, and desire for control versus certainty. Key considerations include the impact of inflation on fixed payments and what happens to the remaining funds upon the owner's death. (not investment advice)</p>
