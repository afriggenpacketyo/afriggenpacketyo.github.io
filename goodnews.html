          <p>Two teenagers have been charged following an investigation by the National Crime Agency into a cyber attack on Transport for London, which occurred on August 31 of the previous year. The attack is believed to have been executed by members of the cyber-criminal group Scattered Spider. Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers were arrested at their homes and are expected to appear in court. The charges include conspiring to commit unauthorized acts against TfL under the Computer Misuse Act. The NCA has previously warned of increasing threats from cyber criminal gangs, highlighting Scattered Spider as an example. The attack caused significant disruption and millions in losses to TfL, a part of the UK's critical national infrastructure. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool's Habit of Late Goals Analyzed with Data</h2>

          <p>Data analysis reveals Liverpool's tendency to score late winning goals this season, contrasting with their performance in the previous season. The team, under Arne Slot, has scored late winners in all five of their competitive matches this season, with the average match-winning moment occurring after 91 minutes. Slot attributes this trend to self-belief and fitness, emphasizing the team's mentality to always push for a goal. While Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson were known for late winners, Liverpool's current rate surpasses even their record. Liverpool's wisest heads are making the difference in the key moments. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper has cautioned that the Federal Reserve risks triggering inflation and asset bubbles if it cuts interest rates too aggressively.

He noted that valuations are currently high but said he wouldn't bet against stocks while the Fed is in easing mode.
