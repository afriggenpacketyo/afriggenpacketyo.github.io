          <p>Princess Catherine Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in early 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazi persecution. She provided financial support, wrote letters of recommendation, and guaranteed immigration documents, and even hosted refugees in her home in England. Her efforts were largely unacknowledged during her lifetime, but have recently come to light through the work of biographers and the stories of those she saved. Singh's legacy is now being embraced by LGBTQ+ communities as an icon for fearlessly living and loving as she chose.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Family Dynamic" by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and achievements, affect a person‚Äôs life trajectory. Research suggests eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention, but sibling influence extends beyond birth order. Siblings can spur each other to pursue different fields and act as mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits. While sibling dynamics can be complex and sometimes challenging, they provide a unique opportunity for self-reflection and growth.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize the country's flight paths, many of which were established around 70 years ago, to potentially speed up flights and reduce delays for passengers. The initial phase of the shake-up will focus on redesigning the complex airspace in and around London through the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS). However, some community groups have warned that the new flight paths could lead to increased noise pollution over previously unaffected residential areas. The government says the changes will make air travel more efficient for all.</p>

          <p>An Indian man was apprehended at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle dozens of rare reptiles, including 44 venomous vipers, into the country. The reptiles, including spider-tailed horned vipers, Asian leaf turtles, and Indonesian pit vipers, were found concealed in the man's checked-in luggage. While importing animals is not inherently illegal, India's wildlife protection law prohibits the import of certain species, particularly those classified as endangered or protected.

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to hold a press conference on June 9 to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association. Multiple association sources said the Mongolian-born 40-year-old, now known as elder Miyagino, will leave the ancient sport's governing body amid uncertainty about the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024 after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers. Hakuho, a winner of 45 elite-level championships and 1,187 matches, both all-time records, retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>
