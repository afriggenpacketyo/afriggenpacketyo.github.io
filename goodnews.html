          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly traded higher on Monday, as investors seemed to disregard the latest tariff developments influencing global trade. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed, and South Korea's Kospi rebounded from a previous fall, while Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a modest decline after hitting a record high. The Reserve Bank of Australia is poised to keep its cash rate stable, navigating a challenging economic environment with "material upside risks to Q3 inflation" alongside indications of softer employment and moderating wages. This article notes that US markets also saw gains on Friday following the release of crucial inflation data, breaking a three-day losing streak for major indexes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into strategies for managing "energy vampires" within friendships—individuals who tend to deplete your emotional and mental energy through their behaviors. Psychologist Suzy Reading characterizes these friends by their excessive need for attention and reassurance, or their subtle ways of eroding your mood through backhanded compliments or an insistence on positivity. Author and journalist Radhika Sanghani emphasizes that the primary indicator is often how you personally feel after spending time with them, noting feelings of being drained. The article provides three actionable approaches: initiating an honest conversation about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries if the friend is unwilling to change, and adjusting shared activities, such as opting for a walk instead of a deep conversation, to mitigate their tendency to dominate interactions. These techniques are designed to safeguard your personal well-being.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations to become a hub for green marine fuels hinge significantly on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While Hong Kong has already implemented liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling operations, green methanol requires a robust infrastructure from upstream production to tax-free storage and sales. Wang spoke at the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. This article notes that with Europe's carbon emissions tariffs, increased green methanol usage is anticipated from 2027, despite its current higher cost. (not investment advice)</p>
