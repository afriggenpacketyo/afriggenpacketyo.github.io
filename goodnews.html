          <h2>Tungsten Producers Panic as China Restricts Exports</h2>

          <p>A mines developer reports that producers of tungsten products in developed nations are panicking because China, which accounts for 82.7% of global raw tungsten ore mined last year, has restricted exports of critical industrial metals. The restrictions came as retaliation against Washington‚Äôs decision to raise duties on all Chinese imports by 10 per cent. The CEO of Almonty Industries says that US defense contractors face a looming supply chain challenge, as they must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. Tungsten is used to make cutting tools, drill bits, heavy machinery parts, ammunition, and armour, and also in clean energy applications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted 54 Afrikaans South Africans, white descendants of mainly Dutch colonizers, refugee status, and they are expected to arrive in the U.S. on Monday. This marks the first group of Afrikaners accepted by the U.S. after President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination. Trump has accused the South African government of ‚Äúdoing some terrible things,‚Äù including confiscating land.

          <p>An Arizona woman used artificial intelligence to create a likeness of her brother, who was killed in a 2021 road rage incident, to deliver a victim's impact statement at the sentencing of his killer. The AI-generated video, which included a disclaimer, allowed the victim to seemingly express forgiveness towards the perpetrator. While the judge praised the video's message, the use of AI in legal proceedings has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about manipulation and deception. The defense lawyer suggested that the court's reliance on the AI video could constitute reversible error and require a resentencing.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are advocating for a rewriting of World War II history, arguing that the conflict should be considered to have begun with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, rather than Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939. This perspective aims to elevate China's role in the war against fascism. The academics made these arguments at a second world war history seminar in Beijing. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, and countries around the globe are marking it with their own commemorations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain that will increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the US will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement leaves in place a 10% baseline tariff on almost all countries, but is seen as a potential model for future trade deals. The deal with Britain is one of 17 that the Trump administration has been trying to strike with major trading partners.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly ready to eliminate tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a significant shift in its protectionist approach. This comes after Trump's tariff announcements on Indian exports. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and experts believe that loosening its protectionist stance is crucial for India's economic growth. While the deal could benefit logistics companies, there are concerns about its impact on domestic manufacturing and the potential for a flood of U.S. goods.</p>

The company is navigating fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs. Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market. The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna.</p>
