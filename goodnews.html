          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda, following Hurricane Erin. As of Saturday afternoon, Fernand was located about 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with sustained winds of 40 mph and moving north at 10 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts Fernand to remain over the open ocean, potentially strengthening into a hurricane by Monday before weakening on Tuesday. The NOAA predicts an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms this year. (not investment advice)</p>
