          <p>New Jersey Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen reached an agreement to end a three-day statewide transit strike. The strike, which began Friday, halted commuter train lines and disrupted travel for thousands of commuters. While union members will return to work on Monday, train service will not resume until Tuesday morning to allow for equipment inspections. The engineers had been seeking a new contract for over five years, aiming for pay parity with counterparts at other New York City railroads. The agreement averts further economic damage to the New York area, where productivity was significantly reduced due to commuter delays.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor of Bucharest, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. With more than 98% of ballots counted, Dan secured 54% of the vote, while Simion received 46%. Simion claimed electoral fraud and called for national protests, but Dan's victory is expected to ease concerns about Romania aligning with countries opposing aid to Ukraine. Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to the European Union and NATO.</p>

          <p>A new Taiwanese chip factory in Arizona highlights the contradictions in Trump's "America First" trade policy, which advocates for domestic manufacturing but relies on global supply chains. The factory, built by TSMC, represents a significant investment in U.S. semiconductor production and a shift away from reliance on Taiwan. While Trump sees the factory as a victory for his tariff policies, the project depends on global collaboration and advanced technology from companies worldwide, challenging the notion of complete domestic self-sufficiency.</p>
