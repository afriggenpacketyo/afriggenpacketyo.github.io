          <p>A unique recycling company in Miami, Sneaker Impact, collects used sneakers from donation boxes and other drop-off locations across the United States, processing over a million shoes annually. The company sorts the shoes, sending reusable pairs to developing countries like Haiti and Honduras, where they are resold in mom-and-pop shops, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and recycled into materials like foam, rubber, and textiles, which are then used to make flooring, mats, tiles, and even sandals. Sneaker Impact aims to reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly business practices, hoping other companies will replicate their model to combat landfills. </p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans, according to a company source. This move follows Nissan's announcement earlier in the week that it would shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants under consideration are Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., which together account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision remains uncertain as discussions with labor unions, parts makers, and municipalities are pending.</p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) after a disastrous election result. Lindner stated that voters wanted less state intervention and more freedom, but the new government is delivering more state control and debt. Christian D√ºrr was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman, receiving 82% of the vote. Lindner's criticism underscores tensions within German politics regarding fiscal policy and economic direction.</p>

With around 286 mainland companies at risk of delisting due to regulatory pressures, Hong Kong sees an opportunity to bolster its financial markets. Deloitte China has submitted proposals to the Chief Executive‚Äôs Policy Unit, outlining strategies to simplify listing procedures and secure funding for these companies.

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are developing a guided rocket artillery system, Tianxing-1, designed to strike aerial targets. Unlike traditional rocket artillery, this system features lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins, enabling extended range and maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase, autonomously adjusting its trajectory to engage targets. Though operating on similar principles as hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 travels at a slower pace, potentially facing challenges in intercepting high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust significantly reduced visibility across the city and suburbs. The National Weather Service confirmed this was only the second time in its history that it issued a dust storm warning for the Chicago metropolitan area. The dust storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, led to near-zero visibility on major interstates, prompting ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and storms mixed with the dust, resulting in reports of "mud rain" in some areas, with wind gusts reaching over 70 miles per hour.</p>
