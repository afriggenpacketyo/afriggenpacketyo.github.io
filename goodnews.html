          <p>Shares of Opendoor skyrocketed by 60% after the company announced new leadership, naming Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. This leadership change follows a pressure campaign from investors and marks a significant turnaround for the stock, which has risen over 400% this year after previously trading below $1. The company, which uses technology to buy and sell homes, stated it is returning to its "founder mode" and plans to leverage artificial intelligence to simplify the real estate process.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could see a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of between 2.7% and 2.8% in 2026. This estimated increase would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54, providing some relief against rising living costs for millions of retirees. The projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% COLA implemented in 2025. The official COLA for 2026 will be announced in October after the final third-quarter inflation data is calculated.

          <p>To combat severe air pollution, the Vietnamese government is implementing plans to ban gasoline-powered motorcycles in the centers of major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The phased bans are set to begin in 2026, aiming to transition the country's 80 million motorcyclists toward electric two-wheelers. This policy is driven by both environmental concerns, as Hanoi was recently named the world's most polluted metropolis, and industrial goals to support domestic electric vehicle manufacturers like VinFast. The move presents challenges for informal workers who rely on their gas-powered bikes for their livelihood.</p>

The potential meeting could occur either before or after the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. This development comes as the White House continues to exert economic pressure, having already imposed 30% tariffs on many Chinese goods while urging European allies to implement their own steep tariffs. Officials are said to be managing expectations for the high-stakes potential summit.</p>

          <p>Australia is investing $1.1 billion to build a fleet of locally developed autonomous underwater attack drones known as "Ghost Sharks." The stealthy, long-range vehicles are designed to enhance the country's undersea warfare capabilities, performing roles from intelligence and surveillance to direct strike operations. This move is intended to complement Australia's future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines acquired through the AUKUS partnership. The first of dozens of these advanced drones is scheduled for delivery to the Australian navy in January of next year.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely stemming from the U.S. tariff agenda under President Trump. Although euro zone inflation is hovering near the bank's 2% target, sluggish economic growth and the lingering impact of trade disputes have prompted a cautious approach. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that while recent trade agreements have reduced some uncertainty, the overall environment remains volatile, and the bank is not pre-committing to a future rate path.</p>

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low at 0.39%, consumers can earn significantly more by opting for high-yield savings accounts. Top rates for these accounts, often offered by online banks with lower overhead costs, are currently between 4.15% and 4.35%. Financial experts advise consumers to compare different account options, paying attention not only to the annual percentage yield but also to potential fees and minimum deposit requirements. Securing a higher rate can substantially boost savings over time through the power of compound interest.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban and will now allow approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar, living in border camps, to work legally in the country. This significant policy change comes in response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which left many refugees facing food shortages. The move is seen as a pragmatic solution that allows refugees to become self-sufficient while also helping to fill labor shortages in Thailand. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a potential regional benchmark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey of global family offices reveals a strategic shift in how the ultra-wealthy are investing their money. These firms have increased their average allocation to public stocks to 31%, up from 28% two years ago, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in private equity from 26% to 21%. This change suggests that while maintaining a pro-risk stance, family offices are favoring the liquidity and current performance of public markets. The survey also indicated that public equities are the preferred vehicle for investing in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liu Jun, a top mathematician from Harvard University, has clarified that his decision to relocate to China's Tsinghua University was driven by personal and family reasons, not political motivations. In an email, Liu explained his move was not a protest against the Trump administration or a sign of professional disillusionment. Instead, he emphasized his deep personal connection to the Tsinghua campus, where he was born, and his desire to be closer to his family. His statement provides personal context to a move that had been viewed through a geopolitical lens.</p>

          <p>According to new U.S. Census Bureau data, the median household income in America rose by 1.3% in 2024 to $83,730. While the Census Bureau does not consider this change to be statistically significant, economists note that it is still an economically meaningful increase for many families, as incomes continued to outpace inflation. The data also revealed disparities, with incomes for the top 10% of earners growing faster than for the bottom 10%, and a widening of the gender wage gap among full-time workers for the second consecutive year.</p>
