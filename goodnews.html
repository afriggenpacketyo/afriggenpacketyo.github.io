          <p>Former college football player Isaiah Bond plans to join the Cleveland Browns after a grand jury in Texas declined to indict him in a sexual assault case, effectively ending the criminal proceedings. Bond, who went undrafted amid the allegations, expressed his gratitude to the Browns for their belief in him and reaffirmed his innocence. While his lawyers advised against discussing case details, he stated that he has refuted the allegations from the beginning. The 21-year-old wide receiver is now set to begin his professional career in the NFL.</p>

          <p>The Japanese economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite facing tariff pressures from the United States. This growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which helped offset challenges in the key automobile sector. The positive data comes even as Japan navigated an uncertain trade environment before reaching a new deal with the U.S. in July. While the Bank of Japan has upgraded its economic forecast, it remains cautious about the potential for a slowdown due to global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city long symbolic of industrial decline, is experiencing a steady economic revival driven by local entrepreneurs. After the collapse of its steel industry nearly 50 years ago, the city is now seeing new life as businesses repurpose abandoned factories and industrial spaces. This revitalization has helped stabilize the population and bring employment levels back to pre-COVID numbers. The city's comeback is being forged not with a single large project, but through a gradual, community-led effort to build a diverse economic future.</p>

          <p>Four years after making a groundbreaking shift to an all-vegan menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is bringing animal products back. Chef Daniel Humm announced the change, citing a desire to be more inclusive and acknowledging a decline in private event bookings and wine sales. The article suggests this reversal reflects the challenges of sustaining a luxury, plant-based dining model, as consumer demand for meat remains high, even amid discussions of sustainability. Critics had also given mixed reviews to the restaurant's plant-based offerings.</p>

He argues that today's market is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble because there are many rational, high-performing companies whose strength can balance out the speculative excess. Cramer points to companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly as examples of rational investments that provide a solid foundation for a portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategic pivot, led by former Tesla engineers, signals a recognition within the American auto industry that it must innovate rapidly to counter the existential threat posed by Chinese automakers in the global EV market.</p>

          <p>As economic growth moderates in China's largest cities, smaller, lower-tier counties and towns are becoming a vital new source of consumer spending. Residents in these areas often have lighter economic burdens and faster income growth, leading to stronger purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend. This consumption upgrade in previously overlooked markets is seen by experts as a key engine for China's economic transition toward a model driven more by domestic consumption rather than investment and exports.</p>
