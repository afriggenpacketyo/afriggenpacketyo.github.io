          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 18:02:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels high and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, this article outlines crucial questions for homeowners considering a home equity loan. Homeowners are advised to assess how much they truly need to borrow, whether their financial needs are urgent enough to justify current interest rates, and if they should wait for potential future rate cuts. The guidance also suggests comparing the stability of a fixed-rate loan against the potential volatility of a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC) to make an informed financial decision.

          <p>The global rise of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional fiat money, presents a significant challenge for China's economic strategy. The vast majority, over 99 percent, of these digital assets are backed by the U.S. dollar, reinforcing its dominance in the emerging digital finance landscape. This trend complicates Beijing's efforts to promote its own digital yuan and reduce reliance on the dollar. The article explores this dilemma, examining how China might respond to the widespread adoption of dollar-based tokens that could undermine its financial ambitions.</p>

          <p>Broadcom announced fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations, largely driven by a 63% year-over-year increase in its AI-related revenue.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut widely expected in September, savers are encouraged to act decisively to secure high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). This article advises that individuals with significant savings, such as $10,000, should evaluate whether they can deposit more to maximize earnings before rates fall. It also recommends prioritizing online banks, which typically offer higher rates, and acting quickly, as financial institutions may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the official Fed announcement.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has concluded his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur. According to reports, the club's ownership group made the decision in the belief that new leadership would lead to greater sporting success. Levy's time in charge was marked by significant infrastructure development, including a new billion-pound stadium, and consistent European qualification, but was also a frequent target of fan criticism for a perceived lack of major trophies.</p>

          <p>Waymo, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Alphabet, has announced plans to begin testing its driverless robotaxis at San Jose Mineta International Airport this fall. This initiative will be the company's first airport-based testing operation in California, with the goal of launching a paid public ride service later in the year. The expansion into the San Jose airport follows a successful launch at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in 2023 and is part of Waymo's broader strategy to grow its presence in major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a consistent downward trajectory throughout 2025, providing some optimism for prospective homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has decreased by over half a percentage point since the beginning of the year, falling from above 7% to approximately 6.50%. While the pace of future declines will depend on Federal Reserve policy and other economic indicators, the current trend suggests a more favorable borrowing environment is emerging.

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages in a class-action lawsuit for improperly tracking smartphone users' online activities.

          <p>This analysis of Daniel Levy's nearly 25-year chairmanship at Tottenham Hotspur portrays his legacy as a duality of major off-field achievements and consistent on-field disappointment. He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, most notably by building a world-class stadium and making the club highly profitable. However, this business success is contrasted with a lack of major trophies and a high turnover of managers, leading many fans to feel that financial stability was prioritized over the pursuit of silverware.</p>

          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged the daughter of a fugitive Nazi official and her husband with obstruction of justice for allegedly hiding a valuable painting stolen during World War II. The 18th-century artwork, "Portrait of a Lady," was looted from Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker and was recently identified in an online real estate listing for the daughter's home. After police raids failed to locate it, the painting was surrendered to the judiciary, and an heir of the original owner has filed a formal claim for its restitution.</p>
