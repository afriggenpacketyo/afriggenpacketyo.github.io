          <p>President Trump announced a "first Phase" peace deal between Israel and Hamas, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line in Gaza. This agreement, confirmed by regional sources and Hamas, is slated for Israeli cabinet approval on Thursday, with hostage releases potentially beginning 48-72 hours later. The two-year conflict, sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, has led to immense casualties, with over 67,000 Palestinian deaths reported by Gaza's health ministry. Trump hailed the deal as a significant step towards lasting peace for the region and the U.S., crediting Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish mediators for their efforts in this complex negotiation. This initial phase aims to de-escalate tensions and pave the way for further discussions on the conflict's broader resolution.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares jumped over 10% after announcing an agreement to acquire Swiss engineering firm ABB's robotics division for $5.4 billion. This strategic move aims to further expand SoftBank's footprint in Artificial Intelligence, aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. This acquisition highlights SoftBank's continued focus on AI investments, including its ownership of Arm and a stake in OpenAI, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI boom.

          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, outlines an immediate end to fighting and phased Israeli withdrawals from Gaza. The plan mandates Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for 250 Palestinian life-sentence prisoners and 1,700 other detainees. It also calls for Gaza's demilitarization, overseen by independent monitors, and governance by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" rather than Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. The proposal emphasizes full aid to Gaza and economic redevelopment, while offering a vague "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood."</p>

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff transformed Middle School 50 in Brooklyn from a "persistently dangerous" school with declining enrollment into a thriving institution by integrating debate into every class. A former high school debate coach, Honoroff expanded the debate team, leading to a third of students participating and a select group winning national championships. This innovative approach, which encourages students to explain their reasoning in all subjects, including math, resulted in significant academic improvements. Proficiency scores in English jumped to 60% and in math to 70%, demonstrating the profound positive impact of debate on student engagement and conceptual understanding, fostering deep pride within the school community.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard a peculiar case challenging an Illinois regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-Election Day, brought by a winning Republican Congressman, Michael Bost. Bost argued he was harmed by a reduced margin of victory and extended staff costs, but both conservative and liberal justices expressed skepticism, finding his claims lacked sufficient individual harm. Justices questioned the precedent of allowing any candidate to sue over policy disagreements, even with no chance of winning. Illinois's Solicitor General also faced scrutiny for arguing only winning candidates could sue, highlighting the complexities and potential "disaster" of setting such a standard.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner praised defender Maya Le Tissier, calling her a "rock" for the team after her match-winning penalty in their Champions League debut. Despite her consistent performance and a record 71st consecutive WSL appearance, Le Tissier has only eight international caps, with England coach Sarina Wiegman preferring her at right-back rather than her club position of centre-back. With key England defenders like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze injured, Le Tissier's strong club form, topping WSL rankings for clearances and touches, has fueled calls for her inclusion in the national squad, with Wiegman set to announce her next squad soon. Skinner believes she will be an "incredible England stalwart."</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. has renewed contracts for film chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, marking a significant reversal of fortune after a challenging period. Six months prior, the co-chairs faced uncertainty due to underperforming films, but a string of recent box office hits, including "A Minecraft Movie," "Sinners," and "Superman," propelled the studio past $4 billion globally for the first time since 2019. CEO David Zaslav credited their leadership for the improved performance and a balanced slate of blockbusters, intellectual property adaptations, horror, and original works.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, which would connect Alberta to the US, was previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations and abandoned by its owner, TC Energy (now South Bow), after permits were canceled. The discussion, described as preliminary, suggests renewed interest despite past opposition from environmentalists and indigenous groups, and the company's prior statement of having "moved on."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator dismissed concerns about "circular investments" in the AI sector, calling the narrative "fundamentally flawed." He argued that large technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are genuinely purchasing AI cloud infrastructure due to high demand, representing a "fundamental infrastructure buildout." CoreWeave, which went public in March and has seen its stock soar over 200%, recently expanded its contracts with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and inked a $14.2 billion deal with Meta. Intrator asserts that partnerships during massive infrastructure expansions are normal, predicting the "circular investment" narrative will pass. (not investment advice)</p>

The collections, including Julian Klausner's "Hard-Soft" approach for Dries Van Noten, offered a spiritual and sensory experience.

          <p>A New York City administrative judge dismissed a civil summons against writer Alex O’Keefe, formerly of “The Bear,” for alleged disorderly conduct stemming from a viral NYC train incident. O’Keefe, who is Black, was detained last month after an "old white woman" complained about his seating. He alleged he was "harassed and detained for sitting while Black," and that police arrested him without speaking to the complainant. Police stated he was not arrested but issued a summons for occupying two seats and refusing directions, delaying service. The judge deemed the charges "facially insufficient," leading to a complete dismissal of the case.</p>
