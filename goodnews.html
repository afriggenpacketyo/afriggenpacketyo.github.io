          <p>Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings revealed strong sales growth, particularly in its data center division driven by demand for GPUs in AI software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, a $50 billion market. Despite these challenges, cloud providers remain crucial customers, comprising about half of Nvidia's data center revenue. CEO Jensen Huang emphasizes the surging demand for AI inference, where Nvidia's GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers; Blackwell chips are designed for this purpose, promising substantial growth in reasoning AI.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a final report revealing that a failed Alaska Airlines landing gear, which caused passengers to scream during landing, was due to incorrect maintenance work. The incident occurred when the left main landing gear collapsed upon hard touchdown in Santa Ana, California, during Tropical Storm Hilary. Investigators found a fatigue crack in a metal trunnion pin caused by excessive grinding during a 2018 maintenance overhaul. The report emphasized that even mild heat exposure from grinding can lead to cracking and subsequent failure of landing gear components.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is giving Harvard University 30 days to challenge the revocation of its certification to enroll international students. This follows an earlier announcement by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to terminate Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification due to alleged non-compliance and an unsafe campus environment. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the administration from immediately revoking Harvard's SEVP certification. Harvard alleges that the revocation violates its First Amendment rights and is retaliatory for rejecting government demands to control its governance and curriculum.</p>

Unlike typical pulsars, this star also sends out X-rays, puzzling researchers about its nature.
