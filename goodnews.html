          <p>Following the discovery of thousands of abandoned chicks in a USPS truck in Delaware, a local animal shelter successfully found homes for the surviving birds. The First State Animal Center and SPCA adopted out over 5,000 chickens, turkeys, and quails to local families, rescues, and farms after they were left unattended in high temperatures without food or water, leading to the death of many. The shelter ensured that the adopters would not use the birds for meat, and the community rallied to provide donations and care for the animals, highlighting a positive outcome from a distressing situation.</p>

          <p>The German economy saw unexpected growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis). This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Meanwhile, the new German government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in three foreign missions. This economic upturn provides a positive sign amidst ongoing global trade tensions and domestic policy considerations within Germany.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in prices for iPhones in China to stimulate demand in a crucial market facing increased competition. The trade-in value for the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been increased to up to 5,700 Chinese yuan, signaling Apple's determination to boost sales in the world's second-largest economy. This move comes as Apple's market share and shipments in China have declined due to competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei.

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This means a typical household will see their annual bill decrease by ¬£129, although millions of customers still owe about ¬£4 billion to suppliers. The price cap, which is set every three months, affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. While charities welcome the cheaper bills, they emphasize that many people continue to struggle with energy costs and debt.</p>
