In 2017, she founded the free ballet group Cinco Estrellas, offering classes to children in her community. Despite a competitive career in modeling, she considers herself a cultural ambassador, using the art form to empower a new generation and provide a positive outlet, much like it did for her during her childhood.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter, he was credited with restoring the agency's image after a period of scandal. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan chose him to lead the CIA, where he worked to mend relations with Congress following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his integrity and troubleshooting skills, Webster was a respected public servant who guided the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies through turbulent times.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has updated his guidance for today's retirees. In his new book, he argues that due to greater portfolio diversification, many retirees can now safely withdraw more, suggesting a rate of 4.7%. Bengen's refined strategy incorporates a wider range of assets, including small-company and international stocks, which he says increases the longevity of a nest egg. He notes that for today's retirees, a withdrawal rate closer to 5.25% or 5.5% might be appropriate, encouraging people to personalize their plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new exhibition celebrates the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who became one of Europe's most famous artists in her lifetime, surpassing even Rembrandt and Vermeer in renown. Specializing in highly detailed and vibrant flower still lifes, Ruysch perfected a genre that converted perishable beauty into a permanent, stable commodity. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, she had unique access to exotic specimens, which she depicted with scientific precision and artistic drama. Her paintings, often set against dark backgrounds, captured a complex interplay of life, decay, and the burgeoning global trade of the Dutch Golden Age.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. The five-year contract makes Sesko the club's third major attacking acquisition of the season, as United looks to rebuild its squad under head coach Ruben Amorim. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, is known for his electrifying pace and physical presence, having scored 39 goals in 87 games for Leipzig. The club's director of football, Jason Wilcox, praised him as one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.</p>

          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki argues there is no supernatural mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle, attributing the disappearances of ships and planes to probability and human error. He asserts that, on a percentage basis, the number of incidents in the region is no different than in any other heavily traffologicked area of the ocean. This explanation is supported by organizations like the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd's of London. They point to factors such as volatile weather from the Gulf Stream and complex navigation as logical reasons for the region's infamous reputation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a sign of de-escalating tensions, North Korea has started removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This move follows South Korea's own dismantling of speakers and halting of broadcasts shortly after the election of its new president, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. For years, both sides have used the speakers to blast messages, K-pop music, and unsettling noises across the demilitarized zone, to the dismay of residents. The dismantling is seen as a positive step toward reducing hostilities on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

          <h2>American Shopping Malls Find New Life with Unconventional Tenants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional American shopping mall is experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, and even apartments. This strategy of subdividing large, empty retail spaces is helping malls increase foot traffic and create new "cross-shopping" opportunities. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people who then patronize other mall businesses. Industry data suggests this mixed-use approach is helping enclosed malls recover from years of decline driven by e-commerce and changing consumer habits.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey teenager's persistent and debilitating symptoms following a concussion led doctors to a surprising diagnosis of a rare brain condition. After months of severe headaches, dizziness, and memory issues, an MRI revealed that Logan Coleridge had an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels. Doctors believe the AVM, not the concussion, was the root cause of his long-term symptoms. Following successful brain surgery to remove the malformation, Logan has made a full recovery and is now preparing to return to the football field.</p>

          <p>Amid rising ticket prices for major concerts, a new survey reveals that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford the cost. According to LendingTree, 23% of adults have used these installment plans for concert or festival expenses, with the figure rising to 37% for Gen Z. While BNPL offers a way to spread out payments, often without interest, financial analysts caution that these services may lack the consumer protections of credit cards. Instead, one analyst advises budgeting for entertainment by creating a dedicated savings fund.</p>

Grimes, who died at age 79, had been ready to scale back her career in 1991 but stayed on to investigate why Soviet informants were being compromised. Her meticulous work scrutinizing financial records and activity logs led directly to the identification of Aldrich Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 after receiving millions for selling secrets to the Soviet Union.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco-based company, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons during the nuclear fusion process. The idea is not to get rich from gold itself, but to generate a valuable byproduct that could offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion energy. While scientists have previously turned other elements into gold on an atomic scale, the process has been prohibitively expensive. This new proposal, though still speculative, is considered clever by some physicists and represents an innovative approach to making clean fusion power economically viable.</p>

The firm believes the fast-growing, high-margin DAT business is a hidden gem whose value is being suppressed.
