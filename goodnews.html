          <p>Rolando Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a surprising turn of events at a boxing event in Times Square, with judges scoring the bout 115-112, 115-112, and 118-109. Garcia, returning after a year-long suspension, struggled to find his rhythm, while Romero's victory earned him the WBA welterweight title and potentially sets him up for a future fight with Devin Haney. This loss disrupts plans for a Garcia-Haney rematch, leaving Garcia contemplating his next steps in the boxing world after acknowledging his mental struggles during his time away.
