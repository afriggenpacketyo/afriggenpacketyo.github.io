          <p>Following a commanding 4-1 victory over eight-time champion Germany, Sweden's women's national team is expressing strong belief in its ability to win the Euro 2025 tournament. The win secured them the top spot in Group C and marked their first Euros victory against Germany in seven meetings. Midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd stated there is "something different" about the squad this year and that they have the potential to go "the whole way." The team, which won the inaugural tournament in 1984 but has not lifted the trophy since, celebrated the significant win with a large contingent of traveling Swedish fans.</p>

          <p>David Gergen, a distinguished political adviser who served in the administrations of four U.S. presidents from both parties, has passed away at the age of 83. Gergen's career spanned roles as a speechwriter, communications director, and counselor for Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton, making him a fixture in Washington for decades. He was also a respected voice in media and academia, co-founding the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard's Kennedy School. Colleagues remembered him for his kindness, sound judgment, and commitment to bipartisanship in an increasingly polarized political landscape, leaving a legacy of dedicated public service.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, a major event celebrating Protestant tradition and heritage. The marches commemorate the 1690 Battle of the Boyne and took place in 18 locations, including a major parade in Belfast. This year's events were noted for their large crowds and peaceful atmosphere, with officials highlighting the day as a positive cultural celebration. The parades, featuring marching bands and colorful attire, proceeded largely without incident, including a feeder parade in a historically contentious area of north Belfast.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a crucial 2-1 victory against the San Francisco Giants and snap a seven-game losing streak. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani set a dominant tone early by striking out the side in the first inning with fastballs reaching nearly 100 mph. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's start provided the momentum the team needed. The performance underscores Ohtani's successful return to the mound following surgery and his vital role in the Dodgers' rotation, even as he builds up his pitch count.</p>

          <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is raising questions about its potential impact on China's declining population, as some individuals see it as a viable alternative to traditional family life. For a growing number of young urban professionals, AI's ability to provide emotional companionship and the future promise of AI-powered elder care are reducing the perceived need for marriage and children. While AI is often blamed for exacerbating demographic challenges by replacing human roles, some experts suggest this technological shift may not be entirely negative. It could lead to a redefinition of life, family, and social support systems in the future.</p>

          <p>The third day of the Test match between England and India concluded with tensions flaring over accusations of time-wasting. England's opening batter Zak Crawley used delays, including calling for a physio, to ensure he only had to face one over before the close of play, angering Indian players. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, defended the tactic as part of the game and pointed to India's own delays earlier in the match, including captain Shubman Gill receiving a massage on the field. The animated exchange highlights the strategic gamesmanship and high stakes involved in the tightly contested cricket series.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek's dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the Wimbledon final was a surprising culmination of her dedicated effort to master grass, her weakest surface. Having previously been known as the "Queen of Clay," the 24-year-old's first tour-level title on grass came after a period of mixed results and personal challenges, including a one-month ban for a contaminated sample. Analysts credit her victory to a renewed mindset, more focused practice time on the surface, and technical improvements to her movement and serve under her new coach. Swiatek herself called the win "surreal," stating that she keeps surprising herself with her achievements.</p>
