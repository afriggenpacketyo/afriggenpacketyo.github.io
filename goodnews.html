          <p>Watches of Switzerland shares experienced an 8% increase following a trading update and a stock upgrade by Deutsche Bank. The company confirmed it's on track to meet first-half expectations, even with the imposition of U.S. tariffs on Swiss imports. The luxury watch retailer stated they don't anticipate any significant impact from the U.S. tariffs in the first half of fiscal year 2026, as brand partners have increased inventories. This positive momentum contrasts with recent market concerns over European economies and rising bond yields, with Deutsche Bank upgrading the stock to a "buy" rating. The firm believes that the downside risk to earnings driven by US import tariffs is much more contained than the shares are reflecting (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A recent ruling in the US government's antitrust case against Google has resulted in Judge Amit Mehta proposing remedies that are viewed by some as lenient towards the tech giant. Google avoids a forced breakup, as the judge decided not to require the company to spin off its Chrome browser, despite requests from government lawyers. The emergence of generative AI has altered the landscape, with Judge Mehta noting that companies in the AI space pose a competitive threat to Google that traditional search companies couldn't. While Google must share some data with competitors and allow them to display Google search results as their own, the ruling is not considered a major win for the tech industry, as it aligns with previous cases where breaking up monopolies was unsuccessful.</p>

China has ambitious plans to develop atomic energy, aiming to exceed 100 gigawatts of installed capacity. Russia has already aided in constructing four nuclear reactors in China and is currently building four more. Likhachev stated that China requires substantial uranium and nuclear fuel for its goals and will need to develop a new generation of closed nuclear fuel cycle reactors based on Russian technology.

          <p>Real Madrid's acquisition of Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool for a minimal fee exemplifies their strategy of securing world-class talent for little to no cost. The club has successfully signed players like David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger, and Kylian Mbappe on free transfers in recent years. La Liga commentator Phil Kitromilides suggests that the allure and prestige of Real Madrid make it difficult for players to resist joining, even if it means running down their contracts with other top clubs. While other European clubs have also made significant free transfers, Real Madrid's consistent success in acquiring top talent for free highlights their unique appeal and strategic advantage. This reflects the club's relentless desire to win trophies.</p>

In other news, a court ruled that Google can keep Chrome but cannot have exclusive contracts to preload its products, and Kraft Heinz is expected to split into two companies.

          <p>The US Open 2025 has seen heightened tension and debate over on-court etiquette, including net cords, underarm serves, and body shots. Jelena Ostapenko accused Taylor Townsend of not apologizing for a net cord, sparking a heated row, while Stefanos Tsitsipas was angered by Daniel Altmaier's underarm serve. Cameron Norrie, however, does not find a lack of apology rude, while others see underarm serves as disrespectful. Hitting an inviting short ball at an opponent who has moved towards the net is another common flashpoint, with Tsitsipas drawing ire for targeting Arthur Fils' body in Rome. The article illustrates the diverse perspectives on sportsmanship.</p>
