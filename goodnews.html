          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter located in Bergen County, New Jersey. The tremors were felt across parts of the New York City metropolitan area and as far as Connecticut. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause any damage. New York City Emergency Management confirmed there were no reports of injuries or structural damage. This event follows a larger, more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, while rare, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi was forced to exit a Leagues Cup match against Necaxa just 11 minutes into the game after suffering an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old forward went down after a collision, later sitting on the field before limping off under his own power. After the match, which Miami won in a penalty shootout, manager Javier Mascherano confirmed Messi felt hamstring discomfort and will be evaluated to determine the injury's severity. This incident adds to a series of fitness issues Messi has faced since joining the MLS club in 2023, raising concerns about his availability for upcoming games.</p>

          <p>Ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, families of the nearly 2,000 children born with congenital Zika syndrome face ongoing struggles with little public attention. Many of these children, now nine years old, have severe disabilities and require constant care. In Maceió, the epicenter of the outbreak, a group of mothers has formed a powerful support network, even moving into the same housing complex to help each other navigate legal battles for healthcare and the challenges of single parenthood. After a long fight, these mothers recently secured a significant victory when Brazil's Congress overturned a presidential veto to approve higher lifetime compensation for their families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC series, "Parenthood," delves into the extraordinary lengths animal parents go to raise their young. The show highlights diverse and dramatic parenting strategies, from poison dart frogs carrying tadpoles up trees to elephant mothers navigating treacherous conditions. One of the most striking examples featured is matriphagy among African social spiders, where the mother is consumed by her offspring for their survival. Director Jeff Wilson notes the series aims to resonate with human parents by exploring universal themes of dedication and adaptation in a rapidly changing world, all narrated by the 99-year-old Attenborough with his signature insight and emotional depth.</p>

          <p>The 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" continues to be celebrated for its significant cultural impact, particularly among South Asian women who saw their own struggles and aspirations reflected on screen. The movie, which follows a Punjabi girl in London who defies her traditional parents to play soccer, is remembered as a landmark for representation. Many women, now in their 20s, recall how the film made them feel "heard and seen" and inspired them to pursue sports despite family or cultural barriers. With a sequel now reportedly in development, the article reflects on the film's legacy and the massive changes in women's football over the past two decades.</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming military parade in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Vijay Prashad, a Global South academic, strongly advocated for Modi's attendance, suggesting it could be a key opportunity to resolve Sino-Indian border disputes with Russia acting as a mediator. He characterized the long-standing border issue as a solvable political problem. However, despite a recent improvement in relations between the two nations, most observers believe it is unlikely that Prime Minister Modi will ultimately participate in the event in Beijing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is currently sidelined from training camp due to a back issue, and his return to practice remains uncertain. Coach Sean McVay stated that Stafford, who recently visited a specialist, will not participate in upcoming joint practices with the Dallas Cowboys and his availability for the following week is yet to be determined. The 37-year-old quarterback's absence is a significant concern for the team, which relies on him as a cornerstone of their offense. In the meantime, veteran Jimmy Garoppolo is taking first-team repetitions as the Rams prepare for their season opener in September.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after being held for two months. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time, was detained in May during what her family believed was a routine green card application interview. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, said he felt betrayed by the arrest, which stemmed from a years-old deportation order she was unaware of. After advocacy from her lawyer and the office of Senator John Kennedy, Paola has been reunited with her husband and two young children, though she must wear an ankle monitor.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving military procurement. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts for drones and electronic warfare systems at prices inflated by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, especially during wartime. The arrests come just after the independence of Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests against a government bill that sought to limit their power, a move seen as crucial for the country's EU accession bid.</p>

          <p>Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, is marking its tenth anniversary, having grown from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance. Launched as a platform for "programmable money," it now underpins a $420 billion ecosystem of decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on its infrastructure, utilizing it for everything from stablecoin settlements to tokenized funds. Despite its success, founder Vitalik Buterin warns that the challenge for the next decade is to scale and integrate with mainstream systems without sacrificing its core principles of decentralization and security.
