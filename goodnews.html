          <p>Trade delegations from China and the United States have begun their fourth round of face-to-face talks in Madrid, Spain. The meeting aims to address escalating trade disagreements that have intensified since President Donald Trump renewed his tariff policies. The discussions, held at the Spanish foreign ministry, represent a continued effort by both nations to find common ground and de-escalate economic tensions. The outcome of these negotiations is being closely watched for its potential impact on the global economy.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Labour Party faces declining popularity, political analysts are looking to the success of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for potential lessons. Mamdani's campaign has resonated with voters through a sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, coupled with clear, compelling policy solutions such as free bus transport and a rent freeze. His success is also attributed to crafting a strong narrative, picking a clear side against the status quo, and being a savvy, authentic social media communicator. The article suggests Labour could benefit by adopting a similar strategy of clear messaging and vision.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old Ukrainian girl, Kira Skliarova, is recovering well after receiving a life-saving heart transplant during a severe Russian missile attack on Kyiv. Her surgeon, Dr. Borys Todurov, and his team risked their lives, driving through explosions to retrieve the donor heart from another hospital. The donor was a 4-year-old girl who had died in an accident, and her mother later met Kira to hear her daughter's heart beating. The story highlights the immense challenges and profound human moments occurring amidst the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Nepal's interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki, has vowed to end corruption and restore calm after violent anti-corruption protests led to the ousting of her predecessor and left at least 72 people dead. The former chief justice was named as the preferred leader by youth-led "Gen Z" activists who organized through social media. In her first national address, Karki acknowledged she was brought to power by "the streets" and promised to hold elections within six months. The unrest was initially sparked by a social media ban but quickly grew to encompass broader economic and governance grievances.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford delivered a career-defining performance, moving up two weight classes to defeat Canelo Álvarez and become the undisputed super-middleweight champion. With the victory, Crawford becomes the first male boxer in the four-belt era to achieve undisputed status in three different divisions. He controlled the fight with his superior skill and timing, brushing off Álvarez's power shots. After the fight, Álvarez graciously admitted Crawford was the better fighter and even suggested he was "way better than Floyd Mayweather."</p>

          <p>Oscar Eagle, who was convicted of a gang-related shooting at age 17, has been exonerated and released from prison after more than 25 years. His conviction was vacated due to ineffective legal counsel and questions surrounding the conduct of LAPD detectives from the infamous Rampart C.R.A.S.H. unit. Eagle had a strong alibi, including medical records showing he was on crutches from a previous injury and at a hospital when the crime occurred, but this evidence was never presented at his trial. His case highlights the severe consequences of prosecuting teenagers as adults and the work of conviction review units to correct past injustices.</p>

          <p>Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's first female president, completes her first year with high approval ratings despite facing significant challenges. She has successfully navigated relations with President Trump, passed major judicial reforms, and overseen a 25% drop in homicides. While continuing the populist project of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, she has carved her own path with a more diplomatic tone and a tougher stance on security. As she prepares to lead the nation's independence day celebrations, Sheinbaum is seen as having solidified her role as the new leader of her political movement.</p>

          <h2>President Trump's UK State Visit Highlights His Mother's Scottish Immigrant Roots</h2>

          <p>As President Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the event also shines a light on his own family's immigrant story. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland and emigrated to the United States in the 1920s, part of a wave of migration that some now term "chain migration." She grew up in a small village, speaking Gaelic as her first language, before leaving for New York and eventually marrying Fred Trump. The article contrasts her journey with her son's hardline immigration policies, noting the irony that his administration seeks to curtail the very type of family-based migration that brought his mother to America.</p>
