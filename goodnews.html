        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Oxford professor Ian Goldin, reports of globalization's death are greatly exaggerated, as it remains "alive and well" in Asia. He posits that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while globalization is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia. He also warns that the benefits of interconnectedness are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics.</p>

          <p>Coastal California is set to experience a period of unseasonably cool weather, with temperatures forecast to be 5 to 15 degrees below normal. The shift, driven by a low-pressure system, will bring a thick marine layer, chilly breezes, and the possibility of light showers to the region. This pattern is a stark contrast to the typical heat of early September and comes as a potential disappointment to Bay Area residents who have already endured one of their coldest summers in decades.</p>

          <p>Young English cricketer Jacob Bethell has significantly strengthened his case for inclusion in the prestigious Ashes Test series after scoring his maiden professional century. The 21-year-old's impressive 110 against South Africa in a one-day international has answered questions about his readiness for top-level competition. This milestone performance puts pressure on England's selectors, who must now decide if his explosive white-ball form warrants a spot in the traditional red-ball format against Australia.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has suggested a potential tactical shift for the team ahead of the World Cup, indicating a desire to incorporate long throw-ins and more direct long balls. This approach would differ from the team's recent qualifying play, which has relied more on shorter passing. Tuchel believes that in the high-pressure environment of a World Cup, such direct tactics can be a valuable and decisive tool for the team to utilize.</p>

          <p>During the Italian Grand Prix, the McLaren Formula 1 team successfully navigated a delicate situation between its two championship-contending drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. A strategic pit stop call resulted in an unintended swap of their on-track positions, but the team swiftly issued an order for them to revert, which the drivers followed. This handling of the situation, prioritizing fairness over a potential on-track advantage, was highlighted as a key element of the team's culture that has so far prevented a hostile rivalry.</p>
