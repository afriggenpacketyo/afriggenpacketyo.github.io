          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyers have refuted claims made by actor Justin Baldoni's legal team that she had agreed to be deposed in his ongoing legal dispute with co-star Blake Lively. Baldoni's team sought to include Swift's testimony, which Lively's attorneys argue is an attempt to create a media spectacle. While Swift's lawyer stated she would comply if forced by the court, they maintain she has no material role in the case, which revolves around on-set sexual harassment allegations made by Lively against Baldoni.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Memphis officials have announced that the city's crime rate is at a 25-year low, a claim met with scrutiny due to differing data methodologies. The city counts crime by incident, whereas the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) and FBI count by victim, which is the standard practice for national comparison. This discrepancy means that while the city's numbers are technically accurate by its own metric, they are not comparable to historical state data and may not fully reflect the number of people affected by crime in a given year.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on data software company Palantir, stating he is "inspired" by its high market valuation while also taking a jab at its pricing. Benioff noted that Palantir's software is the "most expensive" he has ever seen and suggested Salesforce offers a competitive product at a much lower cost. This public rivalry highlights the competition between the two tech firms, particularly for government contracts, as Palantir's market capitalization has grown significantly while Salesforce's stock has declined this year.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has canceled its plans for a fully battery-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to slowing demand for large electric vehicles in North America. The company had already delayed the truck's launch twice from its original 2024 release date. Ram will instead focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, now named the Ram 1500 REV, which includes a gasoline engine that functions as an on-board generator to recharge the battery, offering a hybrid solution.</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, alleging that it is operating as an illegal sports gambling business without the required license. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi's "events contracts" on sports outcomes constitute sports wagering under state law. The lawsuit seeks to halt these offerings in Massachusetts, challenging Kalshi's argument that its federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission supersedes state-level gaming laws.</p>

While some analysts believe lower yields on cash will prompt a significant outflow into the market, others are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds are held by institutions for liquidity and will not move. Historically, money fund assets have only declined during periods of extreme economic stress when interest rates were near zero. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates before formal Federal Reserve action, and that the best rates are reserved for applicants with high credit scores. It also reinforces the conventional wisdom to "marry the home, date the rate," encouraging buyers not to lose their dream house while waiting for rates to drop further, as refinancing is always a future option.
