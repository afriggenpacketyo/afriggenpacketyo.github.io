        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) currently high, savers with significant funds are weighing their investment options. Experts suggest that while jumbo CDs, which require large deposits, traditionally offer higher rates, the current market often provides competitive yields on standard CDs, particularly for shorter terms. Opening multiple CDs in a "ladder" strategy offers greater flexibility to adapt to changing rates, whereas a single jumbo CD provides simplicity but locks up a large sum of money.

          <p>A CEO who has interviewed over 500 candidates identifies three key warning signs that often predict a poor hire. These red flags include being late for the interview, which suggests poor planning; giving vague, theoretical answers instead of concrete examples of personal experience; and displaying low energy or disengagement. The article advises job seekers to be punctual, use specific stories to demonstrate their skills and problem-solving abilities, and show genuine enthusiasm to make a positive and lasting impression.</p>

          <p>Several Premier League clubs are requesting more information regarding the settlement of a legal dispute between the league and Manchester City. The dispute centered on Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules, designed to ensure commercial deals with owner-linked companies are at fair market value. While City has now accepted the rules as binding, other clubs are concerned about the confidential terms of the settlement and whether it will make it easier for state-connected clubs to secure lucrative sponsorships.</p>

          <p>A Phillies fan who caught a home run ball and gave it to his son explained why he then took it back and gave it to a woman who was loudly demanding it. The father, Drew Feltwell, stated he wanted to be a role model for his son by de-escalating the tense situation rather than engaging in a public argument. Although his son was initially upset, the family was later rewarded with souvenirs and a meeting with player Harrison Bader, who signed a bat for the boy.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, allowing tens of thousands of long-term refugees from Myanmar living in border camps to legally work in the country. This significant policy change comes after severe cuts in international food aid, particularly from the U.S., which threatened a humanitarian crisis in the camps. The move is viewed as a pragmatic solution that allows refugees to become self-sufficient while also potentially filling labor shortages within Thailand's domestic economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' hopes for a successful postseason may depend heavily on their starting pitchers delivering longer and more dominant outings than usual. This potential shift in strategy is necessitated by an uncharacteristically unreliable bullpen, which ranks in the bottom half of the league in key performance metrics like ERA. Manager Dave Roberts has recently pushed starters like Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto deeper into games, signaling a potential move away from bullpen-heavy game plans for the playoffs.</p>
