          <p>In a breathtaking conclusion to one of Test cricket's most memorable series, India defeated England by a mere six runs at The Oval. The match came down to the final moments, with a visibly injured Chris Woakes bravely coming out to bat in a last-ditch effort. Ultimately, India's Mohammed Siraj bowled Gus Atkinson to clinch the victory, leveling the hard-fought series at 2-2. The dramatic finale, marked by incredible tension and heroic performances from both sides, provided a fitting end to an outstanding series of sporting theatre.</p>

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk a substantial stock package of 96 million shares, currently valued at approximately $29 billion. This move comes six months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, larger 2018 pay package, ruling that it was improperly negotiated with a board that was not independent. To receive the new restricted stock, Musk must first pay Tesla the exercise price of $23.34 per share. The decision follows a contentious legal battle initiated by a Tesla stockholder who challenged the fairness and process behind the original compensation plan.</p>

          <p>A system in the western Atlantic has strengthened into Tropical Storm Dexter, but forecasters expect it to move away from the United States and pose no threat to land. The storm, with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph, is currently located northwest of Bermuda and is projected to stay north of the island. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, its formation marks an uptick in activity for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters are also monitoring two other disturbances in the Atlantic that have some potential for development later in the week.</p>

          <p>After a surprisingly strong performance in last year's election, independent candidate Dan Osborn is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska again, this time challenging incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, frames the race as a contest between the working class and the wealthy elite, hoping to build on the momentum that saw him narrow the margin against the state's other Republican senator. While he faces a tough challenge against the well-funded and popular Ricketts, Osborn's non-partisan, blue-collar platform aims to appeal to voters tired of the two-party system.</p>

          <p>A new searchable public database containing over 1.5 million pages of records on police use of force and misconduct in California is now available to the public. The Police Records Access Project, a collaboration between UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and several news organizations, provides access to internal affairs records from nearly 700 law enforcement agencies. This initiative vastly expands public access to documents detailing how police departments handle allegations of misconduct and incidents of force resulting in serious injury or death. The database is the culmination of years of work collecting and organizing records obtained through thousands of public records requests.</p>

          <h2>Survey Suggests Children Prefer Unsupervised Outdoor Play Over Screen Time</h2>

          <p>A new Harris Poll survey of American children reveals a strong preference for unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socializing or adult-organized activities. However, the same survey shows that most children are not allowed to be in public without an adult, with many even restricted from playing unsupervised in their own yards. This disconnect suggests that children resort to phones and online worlds for social interaction because their real-world freedoms have been curtailed by parental fears. The article argues for granting children more independence to foster competence, confidence, and better mental health.</p>

          <p>Kate Forbes, Scotland's Deputy First Minister, has announced she will not seek re-election in the next Holyrood election, scheduled for May 2026. The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP cited a desire to spend more time with her young family as the reason for her decision to leave frontline politics. Forbes, who narrowly lost the 2023 SNP leadership contest, will continue in her role for another nine months. First Minister John Swinney praised her invaluable contribution to public life, and Forbes affirmed her continued support for his government and the cause of Scottish independence.</p>

          <h2>Global Fur Production Plummets Over 85% in a Decade Amid Ethical and Economic Shifts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global fur industry has experienced a dramatic collapse, with the number of animals farmed for fur dropping from over 140 million in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This sharp decline is attributed to a successful, multi-decade campaign by animal advocates that shifted public perception and pressured major fashion brands like Gucci and Prada to go fur-free. The trend was accelerated by legislative bans on fur farming in numerous European countries, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mink farms, and economic headwinds in key markets like China and Russia, marking a significant victory for animal welfare.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has announced plans to accelerate the internationalization of the yuan, aiming to increase its use in global trade and finance. The move comes as Beijing perceives growing doubts about the stability of the U.S. dollar, creating an opportunity to elevate its own currency's role. The People's Bank of China pledged to strengthen the offshore yuan market, enhance its financing function, and expand its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This renewed focus marks the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been a dedicated section in the central bank's midyear policy readout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an additional £100 million in funding to crack down on illegal people-smuggling operations in the English Channel. The investment will support up to 300 more National Crime Agency officers and new technology to help track and dismantle the criminal gangs facilitating the dangerous crossings. The move comes as the number of people arriving in small boats has reached a record high for this point in the year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the funding would help disrupt the smugglers' adaptable and ruthless tactics, though critics have dismissed the plan as insufficient.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is holding steady below 9%, with many lenders offering lower introductory rates for the first six to twelve months. With over $34 trillion in home equity held by Americans and primary mortgage rates remaining high, HELOCs present a flexible option for homeowners to tap into their home's value without refinancing. Lenders determine individual rates based on the prime rate plus a margin, factoring in credit scores and debt levels, making it important for consumers to shop around for the best terms.

          <h2>New Federal Data Indicates a Decline in Teen Suicide Rates</h2>

          <p>A new federal report on drug use and health has revealed a promising decline in depression and suicidal behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The annual survey found that the prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12 to 17 fell from nearly 13% to 10%, with a slight drop in suicide attempts as well. Experts suggest the improvement may be linked to more teens opening up about their struggles and getting connected to specialized treatment. However, the report also highlights that millions of teens still experience suicidal thoughts and face challenges accessing mental health care.</p>
