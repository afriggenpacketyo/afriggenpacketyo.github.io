          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to initially cut winter fuel payments to over 10 million pensioners, followed by a partial reversal to extend eligibility to more pensioners this coming winter. Miliband stated that the initial cut was necessary to stabilize the economy and that the subsequent improvement in the nation's finances allowed for the policy adjustment. The revised policy will provide payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less, costing approximately ¬£1.25 billion. The Conservative shadow chancellor criticized the government for leaving pensioners in the cold last winter, while the Liberal Democrat leader highlighted the struggles faced by pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gen Z is showing a resurgence in religious engagement, reversing recent trends of declining church attendance and religious affiliation, as highlighted in a recent episode of Vox's "Explain It to Me" podcast. Experts suggest this shift may be a form of rebellion against previous generations' atheism or a search for community and meaning in a world perceived as lacking. Some observers note a rise in young men joining Catholicism, possibly driven by a desire for traditional hierarchical structures. This trend signals a potential change in the religious landscape of America, prompting ongoing discussion and analysis.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning himself with some of the most liberal members of Congress on this issue. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would gradually increase the minimum wage starting in 2026 and adjust it for inflation in subsequent years. This move is part of Hawley's broader "Pro-Worker Framework" and reflects a shift in the Republican Party towards populism and working-class voters. Vermont Democratic Senator Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.</p>
