          <p>The United Kingdom is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day with four days of events from May 5 to 8. Commemorations will include a military procession at the Cenotaph in London, a flypast by the Red Arrows, and a possible appearance by the King and Queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Street parties are planned nationwide, with councils waiving road closure fees to encourage local communities to celebrate, and pubs in England and Wales will extend their hours. The Tower of London will also feature an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, and various concerts and services will be held to remember the end of World War II in Europe.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina, triggering a brief tsunami warning that was later canceled. The quake's epicenter was located in the Drake Passage, and Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for coastal areas as a precaution. Residents in Punta Arenas, Chile, calmly evacuated to shelters, and water activities were suspended in Ushuaia, Argentina. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties, and Chilean Antarctic bases were also evacuated as a safety measure, and the tsunami warning was lifted after authorities determined that no tsunami had occurred.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global trade tensions, with the People's Action Party (P.A.P.) widely expected to retain power, a position it has held since 1959. The election serves as a test of the P.A.P.'s popularity, with the opposition gaining traction due to voter discontent over the rising cost of living. Opposition rallies have been well-attended, with the Workers' Party emphasizing the need for a more balanced political system. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who recently took office, faces the challenge of navigating the trade war and U.S.-China tensions, and the P.A.P. emphasizes its track record of stability and prosperity, though many Singaporeans no longer feel prosperous.</p>

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election, with polls indicating a slight lead for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party over the conservative opposition. The election is occurring during heightened geopolitical and trade uncertainty due to U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, and high prices and a housing shortage are major voter concerns. Albanese has promised tax cuts, cheaper healthcare, and new homes for first-time buyers, while opposition leader Peter Dutton has vowed to slash fuel tax and invest in infrastructure. Voting is mandatory for all Australian citizens, and the results are anticipated to be known soon, unless the vote is exceptionally close.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cease withholding funds from Maine schools, marking a victory for the state after being targeted over its support of transgender rights. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had suspended funds for a child nutrition program in Maine due to the state's policy of allowing transgender girls to participate in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills responded to the president's threat by stating, "We'll see you in court," and Maine subsequently sued the USDA, resulting in the restoration of funds. The settlement ensures that Maine will continue to receive funds to feed children and vulnerable adults.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and has permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the directive sent the message that lawyers must adhere to the party line or face consequences, violating the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, had its security clearances suspended and faced limitations on accessing federal buildings and government workers. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions, as the judge deemed the executive order a deliberate means of harming the firm.</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats discovered in a 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck, the Emanuel Point II, may represent the earliest evidence of the species in what is now the United States. The cats likely accompanied sailors on ships to control rat and mice infestations, according to a new study. Chemical analysis suggests that the adult cat primarily consumed fish and domestic meat, not relying solely on rats for food. Cats are not native to the U.S. and were likely brought to the Americas by Europeans for pest control, and the study suggests that the cats on the Emanuel Point II may have been cared for by the Spanish sailors.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man, Tim Friede, who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has resulted in the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom, according to scientists. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have demonstrated protection against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant advancement in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites, which kill up to 14,000 people annually and leave many more with permanent disabilities. Researchers identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, and the resulting antivenom cocktail protected mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 venomous snake species.</p>

          <p>President Trump's family's net worth has reportedly increased by $2.9 billion due to crypto investments, as his administration loosens regulations on the digital currency industry. The increase is attributed to the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a Trump family-affiliated crypto exchange. An Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions in World Liberty Financial, further boosting the family's wealth. The SEC has paused investigations into crypto companies since Trump's inauguration, raising ethical concerns, and Trump has expressed his desire for the U.S. to become the "crypto capital of the world."

          <p>Wall Street stocks experienced a rebound, recovering from losses incurred after President Donald Trump's imposition of global tariffs. Major US indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, saw gains, driven by a better-than-expected jobs report and increasing hopes for US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, outpacing analysts' predictions, and Beijing indicated consideration of Washington's offer to hold trade talks. The jobs figures tempered recession fears following data showing a contraction in the US economy, though some experts cautioned that the full impact of Trump's tariffs remains uncertain.</p>

Immunologist Jacob Glanville identified antibodies in Friede's blood that were effective against multiple snake neurotoxins. The research team created a drug cocktail including two antibodies from Friede and a small-molecule drug, offering protection against 19 species of poisonous snakes in mice. Experts suggest that the human origin of the antibodies could result in fewer side effects compared to traditional antivenoms, and the antivenom is being tested in field research in Australia.</p>
