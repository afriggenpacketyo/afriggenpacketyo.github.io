        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planning experts are advising car buyers to use the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to ensure their vehicle purchase is affordable and financially sound. This framework suggests making a down payment of at least 20% of the car's price, financing the vehicle with a loan term no longer than four years, and keeping total monthly transportation costs under 10% of one's income. Following this rule helps reduce overall interest payments, prevents consumers from owing more than the car is worth, and maintains a healthy budget for other financial goals. The article notes that while the rule is a strong guideline, it can be challenging to meet in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a provocative paradigm for understanding the dynamics between the United States and China, contrasting America's 'lawyerly society' with China's 'engineering state.' He argues that while China's system, dominated by engineers, has led to rapid infrastructure development and manufacturing prowess, it often prioritizes national power over individual happiness. Wang suggests the U.S. could learn from China's physical dynamism to address its own stagnation in areas like housing and clean technology. However, he also criticizes the engineering state's role in creating high youth unemployment by cracking down on service-oriented tech industries.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Currently posing no immediate threat to land, the storm is tracking northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict that Gabrielle will gradually intensify, likely reaching hurricane strength by Sunday as it remains over open waters. While its current path keeps it away from the Caribbean, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <p>A California homeowner who remodeled his family's house to be a net-zero energy home over a decade ago is sharing key lessons from the project. The 'Green Idea House' generates more energy than it consumes through rooftop solar panels, eliminating electricity and gas bills and powering two electric cars. Key design principles include strategic roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling, an open stairway acting as a 'thermal chimney,' and maximizing natural light. The owner emphasizes the importance of meticulous research, sticking to a plan with contractors, and adapting to new challenges like a warming climate, hoping to inspire others to adopt similar energy-efficient practices.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw is credited with being the franchise's guiding light, leading the team through a period of turmoil and bankruptcy to an era of sustained excellence and multiple championships. His career, marked by three Cy Young Awards and one of the lowest ERAs in modern baseball history, bridged the gap between the team's difficult years and its current superstar-laden roster. On the night following his announcement, the Dodgers clinched their 13th consecutive postseason berth, a testament to the winning culture Kershaw was instrumental in building.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Discover Fungi That Could Combat Invasive Buckthorn Plant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 06:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the University of Minnesota offers a promising breakthrough in the fight against common buckthorn, an invasive plant species causing ecological damage across North America. Scientists collected and analyzed fungi from dying buckthorn plants, identifying 46 species as potential candidates for a mycoherbicide, a fungus-based biological control agent. This represents an important first step toward developing a targeted method to eliminate buckthorn without the negative consequences of chemical herbicides or the difficulty of manual removal. Further studies are needed to test the pathogenicity of these fungi and select the most effective species for widespread use.</p>

          <p>The 190th edition of Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer and folk festival, officially began in Munich, Germany, with the traditional tapping of the first beer barrel by Mayor Dieter Reiter. The event, which runs from September into early October, is expected to draw over six million visitors from around the globe to the Theresienwiese fairground. Attendees will enjoy beer served in massive tents, traditional Bavarian food, and amusement rides. Despite record-high prices for a mug of beer this year, enthusiasm remains high, with many visitors arriving in the early morning hours to secure tables for the noon opening.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are not just a traditional delicacy but also a vital source of protein for millions. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects are consumed fried, spiced, or with staple foods, and are valued for being organic and rich in nutrients. As conventional meat is often unaffordable, insects provide a sustainable alternative, with some research suggesting their consumption has increased due to economic hardship and environmental degradation. NGOs are now working to commercialize insect farming to improve food security for vulnerable populations, such as orphans.</p>

          <p>Renowned television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to filming in California, keeping all his current and upcoming projects, including 'Big Little Lies' and 'The Lincoln Lawyer,' based in the Los Angeles area. Despite the industry trend of relocating productions to states with better tax incentives, Kelley's company decided to stay, partly motivated by a desire to reinvest in the community after devastating local wildfires. The decision was further solidified by recent enhancements to California's film and TV tax credit program, which aims to reverse the decline in local production jobs and maintain L.A.'s status as the epicenter of the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, 'Smitten,' explores the concept of limerence, a state of intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of 'person addiction' if the object of affection is unavailable or provides unpredictable reinforcement. To break free, he advises strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative 'daymares,' and focusing on new personal goals. The key is to recognize the obsession is an internal mental state that can be managed and overcome.</p>
