        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative radio host John Reid secured the Republican nomination for Virginia's lieutenant governorship after running unopposed in the primary election. Reid, who has a history of Republican involvement in Virginia, will join current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears on the Republican ticket this fall, with Attorney General Jason Miyares also running for re-election. Reid's campaign is centered on a message of unity and focuses on education and immigration, as he aims to grow the GOP in a state with a narrow political divide. He previously faced a controversy involving lewd photos posted online, but the issue was short-lived. The Republican party is hoping to gain control of the Virginia House of Delegates in November.</p>

She emphasized the need for bipartisan condemnation of political violence and expressed determination to continue her work. Despite postponing a town hall meeting due to safety concerns, Scholten characterized such threats as "true domestic terrorism" aimed at silencing lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars with federal approval. The bill mandates full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the bill, alleging it enables Trump to profit personally from digital assets. The GENIUS Act now moves to the House, where it faces potential reconciliation with its own version of a stablecoin bill. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers participating in the city's mayoral primary election can rank their top five candidates using ranked-choice voting. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' second-choice votes. This system has led to unusual alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a particular candidate from winning. Preliminary results for first-choice votes will be reported after polls close, with ranked-choice tabulation occurring a week later.</p>
