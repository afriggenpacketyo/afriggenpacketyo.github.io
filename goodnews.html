          <p>Alaska's congressional delegation is celebrating the Trump administration's move to reverse a Biden-era rule restricting oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Senator Dan Sullivan stated that the previous rule illegally turned areas intended for energy production into wilderness, while Representative Nick Begich III hailed the decision as a major victory. Officials assert that repealing the rule will not weaken environmental standards but will enable Alaska to produce more energy, create jobs, and generate revenue. Governor Mike Dunleavy previously criticized the Biden administration's handling of land sales in ANWR, anticipating a more favorable approach under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% year-over-year U.S. sales increase for May, driven by an employee pricing program amidst rising tariff costs. Sales were led by a 17.2% increase in vehicles with internal combustion engines and a 29% jump in hybrid models, offsetting a 25% drop in electric vehicle sales. The employee pricing program, promoted as "From America, For America," has contributed to consecutive double-digit sales increases. The automaker announced the pricing promotion as President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates could fluctuate in the latter half of 2025, influenced by Federal Reserve decisions.

While a rate cut is unlikely in June, potential cuts later in the year could impact HELOC rates. Borrowers are advised to monitor economic data and compare offers from various lenders to secure the most competitive rates, while being aware of the risks associated with variable rates and potential foreclosure.
