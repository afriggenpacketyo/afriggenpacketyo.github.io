          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers. This move aims to accelerate the transition away from petrol and diesel cars, addressing the high upfront cost which is a major barrier for many drivers. The government also plans to invest £63 million in charging infrastructure, including funding for "cross-pavement gullies" to help residents without driveways install charge points. The policy is intended to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team conducting a sonar survey of the Fox River in Wisconsin has accidentally discovered a well-preserved 19th-century shipwreck. The Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association were mapping the riverbed for other known cultural sites when they found the unexpected hull. The wreck is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a 90-foot wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880. The discovery highlights the rich maritime history hidden in the region's waterways, and further investigation is planned.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has created a novel biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, commonly known as white sugar. This breakthrough offers a potential pathway to turn captured carbon dioxide, which can be used to produce methanol, directly into a food source. The method, developed at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, bypasses the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane, which requires significant land and water. The scientists suggest this technology could help address both environmental challenges and food security issues.</p>

          <p>Gynecologists and medical organizations are increasingly acknowledging and addressing the significant pain some patients experience during IUD insertions. For years, women's pain has often been minimized, but a rise in patient advocacy on social media has brought the issue to the forefront. In response, the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have issued new recommendations for pain management discussions. This includes options like topical anesthetics and anesthetic shots, marking a shift towards taking patient comfort and concerns more seriously in reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring additional regulations to enhance online safety for children, building upon the existing Online Safety Act. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed that new age-verification rules enforced by Ofcom will be implemented this month, but stated this is not the end of the conversation. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle is looking into further actions to combat the "addictive habits" associated with social media and smartphones among young people. Potential proposals include time limits on app usage and curfews, reflecting growing concern over the impact of technology on children.</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced the first successful extraction of uranium from its "National No 1 Uranium" project in Inner Mongolia. The project utilizes a new mining approach described as "green, safe, intelligent and efficient," which reportedly avoids tunneling and the production of toxic waste. This development is significant as it taps into China's largest uranium deposits, which are of the sandstone type, a shift from the country's traditional reliance on volcanic deposits. The new method could enhance China's competitiveness in the global nuclear energy sector.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is facing questions about why it has not yet committed to allowing its players to participate in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, especially now that the NFL has agreed to send players for flag football. While stars like Shohei Ohtani have expressed a desire to compete, MLB has been hesitant, citing logistical challenges and the need to interrupt its season. The delay contrasts with the NFL's proactive move to use the Olympics as a global marketing platform. Proponents argue that featuring MLB's best players would be a massive opportunity to grow the sport internationally.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing crisis, California is creating a new state agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, will split the current Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two, elevating housing to a cabinet-level priority. Supporters hope this reorganization will streamline the state's complex and fragmented funding systems for affordable housing development. While critics question if a bureaucratic shuffle will be effective, advocates see it as a crucial first step toward addressing the state's soaring rents and high construction costs.</p>

          <p>With LeBron James entering the final year of his Lakers contract for the first time in his career, questions about his future are mounting. An opinion column suggests that James, now on a team clearly building around Luka Doncic, could look to Kobe Bryant's 2015-16 farewell tour as a model for how to retire with grace. By announcing his retirement ahead of his final season, Bryant was able to control his own narrative and receive an outpouring of appreciation from fans nationwide. The article posits that a similar move could allow James to celebrate his career and give the Lakers a clear path forward.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Caltech's Dabiri Lab are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into live jellyfish. These cyborg jellyfish can be remotely controlled to swim in specific patterns, allowing them to gather environmental data on temperature and pressure from the ocean depths. Because jellyfish have no central nervous system or pain receptors and can heal quickly, they are ideal candidates for this augmentation. The low-cost, scalable technology could revolutionize ocean monitoring, making it more accessible to smaller research institutions and conservation groups worldwide.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the final fight of the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy, framing it as a landmark moment for women's boxing. The author argues that the tactical, less chaotic nature of the third fight demonstrated progress, as the athletes fought to win rather than just to entertain, earning the right to be "boring" like their male counterparts. However, the article also notes the contradictions that persist in the sport, from disparate pay to the sexualized presentation of ring girls. The piece concludes that while Taylor and Serrano have advanced the sport, its future depends on addressing these larger issues.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of the planet Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 to $4 million. The rock, known as NWA 16788, is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert. A specialized lab confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The rare find represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material currently on our planet.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and has begun a disarmament process, presenting a potential turning point for regional stability. In exchange for complete disarmament, the PKK is demanding the release of its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and amnesty for its fighters. While the Turkish government has expressed cautious optimism, it is waiting for concrete signs of the PKK's disbandment before making concessions. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with its neighbors and boost its status in the Middle East.</p>
