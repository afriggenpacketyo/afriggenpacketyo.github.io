          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to a new defense spending target of 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous goal of 2%. President Trump praised the agreement as a win for the United States, highlighting his demands for allies to increase their defense spending. In 2024, NATO members spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez stated that his country will not meet the 5% goal, considering the 2% target sufficient.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno have become first-time homeowners by building their own homes through the Mutual Self-Help Housing (MSHH) program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to collectively construct homes, reducing costs and fostering community bonds. The project, located near East Annadale Avenue and South Elm Avenue, represents a $1.46 million investment by the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis. The hands-on approach to construction has enabled these families to achieve the American dream and participate in the wealth of the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI assistant Claude was a fair use. The decision marks a victory for Anthropic, which was sued by authors for using copyrighted books without consent. However, the judge noted that Anthropic may have broken the law by using pirated books, ordering a trial to determine damages. The judge reasoned that using copyrighted works to train large language models is transformative, enabling the creation of something different rather than replicating the original works.</p>

          <p>Industry insiders at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, also known as 'Summer Davos,' suggest that Chinese companies should relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems to solidify their overseas expansions. With rising uncertainty over global trade, particularly in the event of a second term for US President Donald Trump, companies are looking to strengthen supply chain resilience. This involves building factories in new markets for both export and local sales, mitigating the impact of tariffs and trade tensions. Relocating entire ecosystems, rather than just assembly, is seen as crucial for long-term success.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has issued a directive ordering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant integration of crypto into the traditional financial system, specifically within American home lending. The directive requires both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars before loan closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.</p>
