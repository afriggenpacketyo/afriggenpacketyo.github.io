          <p>Patricia Clarkson stars in "Lilly," a film about Lilly Ledbetter's fight for equal pay against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Clarkson discusses Ledbetter's remarkable journey and the injustices she faced, including misogyny and ageism. Ledbetter filed a lawsuit after discovering she was paid significantly less than her male counterparts and although she initially won, the verdict was overturned, but she later became a symbol of unequal treatment in the workplace. Clarkson emphasizes that Ledbetter's story resonates with many, regardless of background, and the actress also acknowledges her own experiences with pay inequality in Hollywood.</p>
