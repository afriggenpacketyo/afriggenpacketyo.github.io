          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a version of a DNA repair protein in naked mole-rats that is linked to their remarkable longevity and disease resistance. This discovery, published in the journal Science, suggests that understanding how DNA repair is activated in these rodents could inspire new therapeutic anti-ageing strategies for humans. Naked mole-rats, known for their maximum lifespan of around 37 years—extraordinary for a mammal of their size—offer a unique biological model for studying the mechanisms of extended healthspan. The article highlights the potential for this research to contribute significantly to human health and lifespan improvements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British soldiers will receive new authority to shoot down drones posing a threat to military bases, a measure aimed at enabling faster, more decisive action. Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce this "kinetic option," which would allow troops or Ministry of Defence police to neutralize drones, expanding beyond current protocols of diversion or GPS disruption. The article notes that this follows multiple mystery drone sightings near British airbases used by US forces and widespread drone disruptions across Europe. While initially for military sites, these powers could potentially be extended to civilian locations like airports, addressing growing security concerns.</p>

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his sixth postseason home run, while rookie Trey Yesavage delivered a strong pitching performance with seven strikeouts over five and two-thirds innings. The Blue Jays capitalized on three Mariners errors and turned three double plays, two of which escaped bases-loaded jams, marking a historic defensive effort. This win sets up a winner-take-all game in Toronto, with the victor advancing to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, ending two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule. Paz, the son of a former president, campaigned on promises to stabilize Bolivia's economy, which has been severely impacted by a U.S. dollar shortage and high inflation. Both Paz and his opponent, Jorge Quiroga, pledged to pivot away from populist economic policies, though they differ on approaches to securing international aid and phasing out fuel subsidies. The article notes that Paz's victory is expected to initiate a significant shift in Bolivia's international alliances, favoring stronger ties with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested during an operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District, initially sparking concerns of a possible ICE raid due to the presence of unmarked vehicles and recent immigration enforcement. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved. The article explains that the Friday night operation was conducted by local law enforcement in response to multiple reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activities in the area, potentially linked to establishments or unpermitted street vendors.

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, argues that Elon Musk's vision-only system for self-driving vehicles is not safe enough, advocating instead for a multi-sensor approach. Qiu contends that Level 3 or 4 automation requires additional sensors like LiDAR, citing "corner cases" where vision alone struggles, such as distinguishing a white car from a cloud or detecting unlit trucks at night. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu highlights significant cost reductions and performance increases in LiDAR systems. The article notes that many auto executives, including Ford's CEO, consider LiDAR "mission critical" for safety and reliability.</p>

          <p>Eighteen decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee, are now featured in a Los Angeles art exhibit titled "Monuments," which opens on October 23. The exhibit aims to confront the warring narratives of American history, explicitly challenging the "Lost Cause" ideology that romanticizes Confederate figures and downplays their connection to slavery. Curator Hamza Walker emphasizes that these figures fought for white supremacy, contrasting with President Trump's calls to reinstall such statues. The article highlights how artists like Kara Walker are transforming these symbols, with her "Unmanned Drone" sculpture reimagining Stonewall Jackson into a "ghostly form" to critique mythological narratives of white supremacy.</p>
