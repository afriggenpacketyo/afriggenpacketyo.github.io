        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is launching its highly anticipated activewear collection in partnership with Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, after facing production delays. The collaboration, named NikeSKIMS, is a strategic move by Nike to regain market share in the women's apparel sector from competitors like Lululemon and Vuori. The line aims to blend performance and lifestyle, featuring Nike's drying technology for athletic use alongside versatile pieces for everyday wear. For Skims, which was recently valued at $4 billion, the partnership provides access to Nike's extensive manufacturing capabilities and global reach, marking a significant growth opportunity for the brand.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced a monumental $100 billion investment in OpenAI to support the construction of massive new data centers powered by Nvidia's AI processors. The project aims to build systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to four to five million of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). This partnership underscores the deep interdependence between the two companies, as OpenAI's demand for powerful chips has fueled Nvidia's growth since the launch of ChatGPT. The investment will be deployed progressively, with the first phase expected to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's next-generation systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 4.3 magnitude earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley, waking many residents just before 3 a.m. The United States Geological Survey reported that over 22,000 people felt the tremor, which caused shaking and loud noises but resulted in no reports of major damage or injuries. In response, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) operated trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. The event serves as a reminder for residents in the seismically active region of the importance of being prepared for larger earthquakes.</p>

          <p>During the Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the New York Giants, Coach Andy Reid and tight end Travis Kelce were seen in a heated exchange on the sideline, which included Reid bumping Kelce's shoulder. After the game, Reid dismissed the incident, attributing it to Kelce's passionate and emotional nature, stating that he appreciates that energy and that the team needed more of it. This is not the first public sideline spat between the two, with a similar interaction occurring during Super Bowl LVIII. Reid emphasized his strong relationship with Kelce and urged reporters not to overstate the significance of the confrontation.</p>

          <h2>New Federal Reserve Governor Argues for Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 13:04:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran argued that the central bank's benchmark interest rate is excessively high and should be cut by nearly two percentage points. He contended that policy changes from the White House, including those on taxes, immigration, and deregulation, have created a disinflationary environment that justifies a more aggressive easing of monetary policy. Miran's stance places him outside the consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in the recent vote, advocating for a half-point cut instead of a quarter-point.

          <p>Gold has surged to a new record high, trading above $3,700 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and await key inflation data. The precious metal has gained over 40% this year, driven by central bank purchases and geopolitical tensions. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for investors to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than owning physical bullion, due to lower costs and higher liquidity. Despite the strong performance, financial advisors typically recommend limiting gold allocation to a small portion, such as under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio.

The final match is set to be played in a sold-out 82,000-seat stadium, establishing a new record for the largest crowd in women's rugby. Throughout the tournament, a total of 440,000 tickets have been sold, more than triple the number from the previous event. The success is attributed to strategic planning, including competitive ticket pricing, weekend-focused scheduling to attract families, and a marketing approach that promoted personalities from various international teams, not just the host nation's.</p>

          <p>An elk known as Emil, who became a social media sensation after wandering across Central Europe for months, has been safely captured in Austria. Wildlife officials tranquilized the young male near a motorway, fitted him with a GPS tag, and released him near the Czech border. Emil's journey covered nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, with his movements tracked by thousands of followers online. It is hoped that he will now join the small elk population in the Sumava forest, ending his extensive travels and remaining in a more suitable habitat.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch has announced that Michelob Ultra is now the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline is attributed to several factors, including tariffs and reduced spending among its core Hispanic consumer base, which has been impacted by President Trump's immigration policies. The shift in market leadership is reflected in the companies' stock performance, with AB InBev's shares climbing while those of Modelo's parent company, Constellation Brands, have fallen.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, has declared that his party has a moral obligation to prevent Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party from gaining power. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey argued that as voters move away from the Conservative and Labour parties, the Liberal Democrats must present themselves as a viable alternative to Reform's platform, which he likened to "Trump's America." Acknowledging Reform's recent rise in opinion polls, Davey emphasized the need to challenge Farage on issues like immigration by proposing practical solutions, such as addressing the asylum application backlog.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, placing its operations under a new American-based joint venture with a majority of U.S. investors and board members. Under the plan, tech company Oracle will act as the security provider, overseeing data storage and the app's content recommendation algorithm, which will be copied and retrained on U.S. data. A senior White House official stated the U.S. government would not hold an equity stake or a board seat. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order approving the deal's framework, extending the ban's enforcement pause to allow for finalization.</p>

          <p>As part of the proposed deal to continue its U.S. operations, TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained using only American user data.

This arrangement is designed to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access U.S. user data or influence content. While the White House is confident China has approved the framework, some analysts worry that creating a U.S.-only algorithm could potentially degrade the user experience by isolating it from global content trends.</p>

Gates clarified that one does not need a billion dollars to achieve this state, but rather enough financial security to be free from the daily stress of covering essential expenses. He also highlighted the rising costs of healthcare and education in the U.S. as a critical issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
