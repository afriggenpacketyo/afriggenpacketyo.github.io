          <h2>General Motors Exceeds Second-Quarter Earnings Expectations Despite Tariff Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:39:45 EDT</div>

          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, reporting an adjusted earnings per share of $2.53 on $47.12 billion in revenue. Despite the positive report, the company's stock saw a slight dip amid ongoing uncertainty from US auto tariffs, which GM estimates could have a significant financial impact. CEO Mary Barra stated the automaker is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives while affirming its full-year guidance. The company is also navigating the potential end of EV tax credits, adding another layer of complexity to its future plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts projecting positive results, forecasting earnings per share of 83 cents on $12.54 billion in revenue. Despite company executives warning of challenging comparisons to a strong quarter last year, optimism remains high due to Coke's significant pricing power and global market presence. The company is also navigating potential choppiness from trade tariffs, though its full-year organic revenue growth forecast remains strong at 5% to 6%. The report comes as rival PepsiCo noted a decline in its North American beverage volume, suggesting a complex market environment for the beverage giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Political Influence in Washington Grows, Surpassing Other Tech Leaders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:01:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a highly influential figure in Washington, reportedly eclipsing Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk in his ability to navigate US-China policy. Huang's success is tied to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips, which has given him significant leverage within the Trump administration. This influence was demonstrated by the recent reversal of restrictions on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China, a move Huang openly lobbied for by arguing that such limits would ultimately harm American tech leadership. His ascent marks a shift in the tech industry's political power dynamics amid escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Democrats Can Win Back a Segment of Trump's Working-Class Voters</h2>

          <p>New research from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests a path for Democrats to regain support among working-class voters, including a specific segment of those who backed Donald Trump. The analysis indicates that while these voters are socially more moderate than the Democratic base, they are also "economic egalitarians" who favor policies like raising the minimum wage, protecting jobs, and strengthening Social Security. The report identifies that approximately 11% of Trump's working-class supporters hold these economically progressive and socially moderate views. Winning over even a fraction of this group could be electorally significant in closely contested elections.</p>

          <h2>LAPD Chief Announces First Major Leadership Reorganization</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell has initiated his first significant leadership shake-up since taking command, reassigning over a dozen high-ranking officials. Key moves include promoting three deputy chiefs—Emada Tingirides, Michael Rimkunas, and Scott Harrelson—to top assistant chief roles, with Tingirides becoming the highest-ranking Black woman in the department's history. The reorganization also resurrects the Human Resources Bureau, which was shut down in 2004. These changes signal McDonnell's strategy for reorganizing the department amid challenges with recruitment and his plans to overhaul detective ranks and the misconduct complaint system.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a new wireless device designed to alleviate a common anxiety for breastfeeding mothers: not knowing how much milk their baby is consuming. The small set of electrodes, worn on the mother's breast, measures the volume of milk expressed during a feeding and transmits the data in real-time to a smartphone app. This technology provides immediate feedback, helping parents and pediatricians ensure newborns, especially those who are underweight or ill, are receiving adequate nutrition. The device, which is still in development, aims to reduce the stress that often leads mothers to abandon breastfeeding prematurely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to community needs following the Palisades fire, UCLA researchers have launched a new network of 20 air pollution monitors across northwest Los Angeles County. The system is designed to provide granular, real-time data on both fine (PM 2.5) and coarse (PM 10) airborne particles, which are often kicked up by reconstruction and debris removal in burn areas. Unlike many existing monitors, this network specifically tracks the larger PM 10 particles, giving residents a more complete picture of local air quality. The data is available on a public, color-coded online map, allowing people to make informed decisions about outdoor activities.</p>

          <p>Doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have created an AI-powered 'robot' therapist named Xaia, designed to provide mental health support through a virtual reality headset. The tool, an acronym for eXtended-reality Artificially Intelligent Ally, engages users in dialogue within a calming virtual environment, drawing from hundreds of therapy transcripts to offer empathetic responses. Xaia is being studied for its effectiveness in helping patients with conditions like chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, aiming to supplement rather than replace human therapists amid a national shortage of providers. The technology represents a significant step in the integration of AI into digital mental healthcare.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a new sanctions regime targeting the global criminal networks behind people-smuggling operations. The measures will allow for asset freezes, travel bans, and financial restrictions against individuals and companies involved, including gang leaders, corrupt officials, and suppliers of small boats. This policy is a central component of the government's strategy to clamp down on illegal small boat crossings of the English Channel. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the sanctions as a first-of-its-kind initiative designed to disrupt the business model of gangs who prey on vulnerable people, though questions remain about international enforcement.</p>

          <p>An investment analysis identifies Nvidia, Alphabet, and IonQ as promising stocks for those looking to invest in the growing field of quantum computing. The article suggests Nvidia is crucial for integrating quantum and traditional systems, while Alphabet's vast resources and research breakthroughs give it a significant advantage. IonQ is highlighted as a strong pure-play company due to its unique and potentially more cost-effective trapped-ion technology, which differs from the superconducting approach of its larger competitors. This positions it as a higher-risk, higher-reward option in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Kentucky Hemp Retailer Urges Senator McConnell to Oppose Federal Product Ban</h2>

          <p>A Kentucky hemp retailer has penned an opinion piece urging Senator Mitch McConnell to reconsider his call for federal legislation that would re-criminalize certain popular hemp products. The author argues that such a federal ban would undermine Kentucky's own comprehensive state law, which was passed in 2023 to regulate the industry effectively, including restricting sales to adults and requiring lab testing. She contends that Kentucky has already created a safe, regulated market and that a federal prohibition would harm legitimate businesses and drive the industry underground. The piece champions states' rights to govern their own affairs and protect their local economies.</p>
