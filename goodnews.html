        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued strength in June by adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' expectations and keeping pace with the average monthly gain over the last year. This performance lowered the national unemployment rate to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. The growth was primarily led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw a reduction. Despite this resilience, economists anticipate a potential slowdown, with the Federal Reserve holding off on interest rate cuts due to tariff-related inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone on Wednesday, becoming the 20th player in MLB history to record 3,000 career strikeouts. The landmark moment occurred in the sixth inning against the Chicago White Sox, as Kershaw struck out Vinny Capra on his 100th pitch of the game. The game was paused as players from both teams and the sold-out stadium gave him a standing ovation. Kershaw is now one of only four left-handed pitchers in the elite 3,000-strikeout club, joining Randy Johnson, Steve Carlton, and CC Sabathia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen for the fifth straight week, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.67%, providing a potential opening for homebuyers. This downward trend may continue, as experts anticipate the Federal Reserve could cut its benchmark rate in September. With the possibility of more buyers entering the market later this year, prospective homeowners are advised to prepare by checking their credit reports, researching real estate agents, and securing mortgage pre-approval. These steps can help buyers position themselves favorably in a competitive market as borrowing costs potentially decrease further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Documentary on Chef Nobu Matsuhisa Focuses More on Brand Than Culinary Art</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" explores the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film is critiqued for emphasizing his global brand over his culinary genius. Directed by Matt Tyrnauer, the documentary chronicles Matsuhisa's journey from humble beginnings and early failures to establishing a high-end restaurant empire with co-founder Robert De Niro. While featuring celebrity patrons like Cindy Crawford and highlighting the brand's exclusivity, the film is said to lack a deep exploration of Matsuhisa's innovative techniques. Critics suggest it functions more as a commercial for the brand than an intimate profile of the chef.</p>

          <p>The second season of John Leguizamo's docuseries, "Leguizamo Does America," premieres on MSNBC, exploring Latino communities in cities like Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Denver. The new season arrives in a changed political climate under the Trump administration, with increased threats of deportations impacting the communities featured. Leguizamo and director Ben DeJesus aim to highlight the contributions and resilience of Latinos as an "antidote" to what they describe as cruel and inhumane treatment. The series continues Leguizamo's long-standing effort to increase Latino representation and visibility in media, framing their success as a form of resistance.</p>

          <h2>Guidance on Recognizing When Credit Card Debt Requires Professional Help</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five key signs that an individual's credit card debt may be too substantial to manage with a do-it-yourself payoff plan. These indicators include consistently failing to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards for essential living expenses. Other warning signs are a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 40% and being unable to qualify for reasonable debt consolidation loans. When these situations arise, it is often necessary to seek professional help through options like credit counseling, debt settlement programs, or, in extreme cases, bankruptcy.

          <p>India has seized complete control of the second Test against England, driven by a monumental score of 269 from captain Shubman Gill. His innings, the highest by an Indian captain anywhere in the world, powered India to a massive total of 587. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled, collapsing to 77-3 by the close of day two. After their comeback victory in the first Test, England now faces a formidable challenge to avoid a series-leveling defeat, as India's bowlers found significant movement that England's attack could not.</p>

          <p>Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon credits his strong performance this season to having a competitive car and a new benchmark in teammate Carlos Sainz. While his team boss believes Albon has raised his game, Albon feels he is executing his race weekends similarly to past years, but now has a car that consistently allows him to expect points. He reflects on his career journey, including his challenging stint at Red Bull, and discusses how a car's characteristics can suit one driver over another. Albon is optimistic about Williams' trajectory, realistically targeting front-end contention by the 2028 season.</p>
