        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts report that climate change is causing a noticeable delay in the arrival of peak fall foliage, with colors appearing about a week later than they did historically. Warmer autumn temperatures are the primary driver of this shift, which impacts the timing of when leaves change from green to vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows. While online maps provide general predictions for leaf-peeping tourism, local conditions like rainfall and elevation play a significant role. Foresters advise that despite regional variations and some drought impacts, beautiful foliage can still be found by exploring different locations and elevations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has lifted a stop-work order imposed by the Trump administration, allowing Danish energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and is expected to power over 350,000 homes. The Interior Department had halted the project in August, reflecting President Trump's broader opposition to the offshore wind industry. Orsted successfully argued that the order was unlawful and issued in bad faith, marking a significant development in the conflict between renewable energy projects and current administration policy.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs from Original Medicare, with 2025 premiums varying widely based on location, plan type, and personal factors. Monthly costs can range from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for comprehensive coverage, though most beneficiaries pay between $90 and $300. To lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible to avoid penalties for pre-existing conditions, comparing quotes from multiple insurers, and considering plans with higher cost-sharing if one is in good health.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have commented on the Trump administration's decision to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for hiring overseas workers. Both tech leaders expressed positive views, suggesting the move could help attract top talent to the United States. Huang emphasized that immigration is the foundation of the American Dream and vital for the nation's future, while Altman stated that streamlining the process and outlining financial incentives seems beneficial. The new fee represents a major shift for the technology sector, which heavily relies on the H-1B program to fill highly skilled roles.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced a monumental plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to support the construction of advanced data centers powered by Nvidia's AI processors. The project aims to build and deploy systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to 4-5 million of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). This partnership deepens the ties between the two AI giants, ensuring OpenAI has the immense computational infrastructure needed for developing next-generation AI models. The investment will be deployed progressively as the infrastructure is built, with the first phase expected to come online in late 2026.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch has announced that Michelob Ultra is now the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Constellation Brands' Modelo Especial. Data from Circana shows the light lager claimed the top spot in retail channels for the 52 weeks ending in mid-September. This shift marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost its long-held top position two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline coincides with challenges for Constellation, including tariffs and reported weaker demand among its core Hispanic consumer base due to economic and policy pressures.</p>

According to sources cited by Ford Authority, an electrified model known internally as the S650E has progressed to a real-world testing phase. While this does not guarantee a future production model, it indicates that Ford is closer than ever to delivering on its long-standing plan for a hybrid pony car.

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid has dismissed a heated sideline exchange with tight end Travis Kelce during their win against the New York Giants, telling reporters not to "make too much of it." Cameras captured the two yelling at each other in the second quarter, with Reid at one point bumping Kelce's shoulder. Reid attributed the interaction to Kelce's passionate and emotional nature, stating that he appreciates his star player's intensity and that such moments are part of the game. This is not the first on-field spat between the two, who had a similar, widely publicized incident during Super Bowl LVIII.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran argued that the central bank's benchmark interest rate is excessively high and should be cut by nearly two percentage points. Miran contended that policy changes in immigration, taxes, and regulation, along with cooling rental costs, have lowered the neutral interest rate, making current policy overly restrictive. He warned that maintaining such tight policy risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment. His position is a significant departure from the more cautious consensus among his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. Experts suggest that exposure to gold is best achieved through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that track the physical commodity, as this is more efficient than owning physical bullion. Financial advisors typically recommend limiting gold allocation to a small portion of a diversified portfolio, such as under 3%, due to its nature as a commodity. (not investment advice)</p>
