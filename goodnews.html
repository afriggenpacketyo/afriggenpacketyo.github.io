          <p>Residents of Starbase, Texas, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX, have been notified that they may "lose the right to continue using" their property as a new zoning ordinance and citywide map are considered.

The company is planning to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and reducing its exposure to China. CEO Richard Dickson stated that the company does not expect meaningful price increases for consumers. While first-quarter results exceeded expectations, Gap's gross margin forecast came in weaker than anticipated, and the company is navigating challenges related to President Trump's trade policies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, offers borrowers a chance to have a portion of their balance forgiven, typically between 30% to 50%. Qualification often requires a minimum debt balance of $5,000 to $10,000, being behind on payments, and demonstrating financial hardship. While debt settlement can be achieved through various avenues, including bankruptcy or debt management programs, it's crucial to clarify the terms with the debt relief company.
