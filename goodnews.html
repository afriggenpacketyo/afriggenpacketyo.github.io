          <p>A-list celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom, have converged on Venice for the opulent, three-day wedding celebration of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. The lavish affair, featuring festivities across the historic city, has not been without controversy, drawing significant protests from local groups concerned about over-tourism and its impact on Venice. Climate change activists have also demonstrated against the event's extravagance, highlighting a stark contrast between the celebration and pressing global issues. The grand event is scheduled to culminate with a large party for the hundreds of invited guests.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit low-key, return to the ring, securing a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon. This win marks a crucial turning point for Wilder, being his first since October 2022 after suffering three defeats in his previous four bouts, which led to widespread speculation about his career's future. While the performance was dominant, it was a more measured and less explosive "Bronze Bomber," who indicated a new focus on becoming a more complete, all-round fighter. The victory keeps alive the potential for high-stakes future matchups, including a long-awaited bout with Anthony Joshua.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a distinct comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay. The research note posits that these systems already operate in a manner similar to stablecoins, being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and functioning within a well-established regulatory environment. This existing, robust infrastructure and oversight could allow China to stay ahead of the curve as stablecoins become a more central part of the global economic and financial landscape.

          <p>Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the current chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is scheduled to make a significant visit to the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in July. This visit holds symbolic weight, as he is expected to tour the memorial museums and other key sites related to the 1945 atomic bombings that devastated the cities. According to sources, the itinerary for Frydnes also includes potential meetings with 'hibakusha,' the aging community of survivors from the atomic attacks.

          <p>A pioneering study conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security has uncovered a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and experiencing lower rates of depressive symptoms. The research focused on working-age individuals and analyzed the effects of a diet comprising staples like rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, seaweed, and cooked vegetables. This is reportedly the first study of its kind to specifically investigate the potential mental health benefits derived from this long-standing dietary pattern. The findings suggest that traditional food choices could play a role in psychological well-being.</p>

The new establishment is designed as a wellness retreat that artfully blends the building's original Western architectural grandeur with elements of modern Japanese design, preserving a piece of local history for a new purpose.</p>

The program, designed for students at the Kennedy School of Government, aims to provide educational stability amid the political and financial uncertainty currently facing the prestigious institution.

          <p>The British government has unveiled a sweeping reform of the National Health Service (NHS) in England that will see the elimination of 201 associated administrative and oversight organizations. This major restructuring, a key part of the Labour party's new 10-year health strategy, will dissolve bodies responsible for patient advocacy and whistleblower support, such as Healthwatch England. According to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, the primary goal of the overhaul is to reduce bureaucratic complexity and redirect resources to frontline care, creating a system with "more doers and fewer checkers." The plan also includes axing NHS England and bringing the system under closer government control.</p>

The innovative technique presents a significant potential alternative to more invasive methods, such as those being developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink, and could revolutionize treatment for paralysis by reducing surgical risks and shortening patient recovery times.</p>
