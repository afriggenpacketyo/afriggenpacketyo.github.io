          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil had been in ICE custody for over 100 days due to his role in campus protests against Israel. The Trump administration sought his deportation, alleging his activities aligned with Hamas, though he has not been charged with any crimes. U.S. District Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled Khalil was not a threat and deemed the government's actions an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, protecting critical research in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House. The release occurred shortly after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, and Lukashenko's spokeswoman stated the release was ordered at Trump's request. The freed prisoners have been transferred to Lithuania and are receiving care.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The bill is expected to face legal challenges from critics who argue it violates the separation of church and state. The law requires public schools to post a 16 x 20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents say the measure infringes on religious freedom.</p>

          <p>A BBC report delves into the daily challenges faced by receptionists at a GP practice during the "8am scramble" for appointments. Receptionists often face verbal abuse from frustrated patients struggling to secure appointments. The Labour government has pledged to end the early morning phone "scramble" by providing extra funding to general practices. The new contract aims to improve online appointment booking and triage patients based on medical need, yet the overall situation remains a significant problem.</p>

          <p>The band South Arcade discusses their musical inspiration, which draws heavily from Y2K core, a growing trend reflecting nostalgia for the late 90s and early 2000s culture. The band, whose members were born around the turn of the millennium, finds inspiration in the music and fashion of that era, influenced by older siblings and friends. Despite not experiencing the Y2K era firsthand, South Arcade has become a figurehead of the revival, attracting both older fans and a younger audience discovering the music for the first time. They initially gained traction on TikTok, showcasing rehearsal footage.</p>

          <p>In 1995, ten giant statues of Michael Jackson were erected around the world to promote his album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. Thirty years later, some of these statues still exist in unexpected locations, while the fates of others remain uncertain. One statue stood at a McDonald's in the Netherlands for years until it was removed following the Leaving Neverland documentary. Another statue can be found in a defunct nightclub in Austria, and a repainted statue has been spotted in an abandoned theme park in Johannesburg.</p>

Experts caution against relying on simplistic solutions for stress, emphasizing the importance of addressing the underlying causes. While some techniques like mindfulness, exercise, and therapy can help regulate cortisol, sudden body changes should be checked by a medical professional.

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla criticized the Trump administration after Vice President JD Vance referred to him as "Jose" during a news conference. Padilla called the misnaming "petty and unserious," suggesting it reflected the administration's skewed priorities. Vance's press secretary claimed the vice president misspoke, but Padilla suggested the misnaming was intentional. Other California Democrats rallied behind Padilla, highlighting racial undertones in Vance's comments and defending Padilla's role as a senator.</p>
