          <h2>Tariff Exemption's End Impacts Advertising Revenue for Tech Giants Like Meta and Alphabet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 00:01:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods has begun to affect advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other large platforms. The tariff exemption had previously enabled low-cost online retailers such as Temu and Shein to offer heavily discounted goods directly from Chinese factories, leading to substantial digital advertising spending. President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting goods from China and Hong Kong to tariffs as high as 145 percent. This has caused Temu and Shein to reduce their advertising spending on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Google, which is expected to create a headwind for these tech companies' ad businesses in 2025. The article suggests that Meta, Snap, and Google are already seeing the impact of this shift as Asian retailers redirect spending to other markets.</p>
