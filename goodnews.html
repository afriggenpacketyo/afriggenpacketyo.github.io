          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz prison. Trump stated the reopening would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," aiming to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. The prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, would be rebuilt on Alcatraz Island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <h2>Egg Freezing Popularity Increasing Among Young Women to Preserve Their Fertility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:04:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popularity of egg freezing is increasing among young women as a way to preserve their fertility, with procedures increasing more than sixfold from 2014 to 2023. Experts say that egg freezing is a revolutionary procedure, comparable to the introduction of the birth control pill, as it allows women to delay childbearing until they are ready. The process involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by egg retrieval and freezing. While egg freezing can be empowering, it is also expensive and not a guarantee of future pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing offers women options to preserve their fertility, but it comes with a significant financial burden. The procedure has become more common, with younger women increasingly choosing to freeze their eggs. While it can alleviate the pressure of the biological clock and provide a sense of control, experts caution that it's not a guarantee of future pregnancy.  There is a debate over whether companies offering egg freezing benefits are truly supporting women or simply seeking to retain employees.</p>
