          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scammers who falsely claim that artificial intelligence can predict questions on the national college entrance examination, known as the gaokao, which is a high-stakes test for over 13.3 million students. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security are jointly investigating and cleaning up "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Scammers are reportedly selling mock papers online at inflated prices, claiming they use AI to predict actual questions, and some social media accounts are falsely claiming access to "top secret" information. The government's announcement emphasized that some are exaggerating information to attract traffic and induce candidates and parents to buy simulated test questions and reference materials at high prices.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2bn investment, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened, aiming to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. Initially conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, the 28-mile upgrade involved constructing nearly 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. The project also included planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact, offsetting over seven million kilograms of CO2 annually, and relocating creatures such as bats and newts. Financed using the Mutual Investment Model, the Welsh government will pay over ¬£40m annually for 30 years for the road's maintenance by a private firm until 2055.</p>

After Aaron Judge gave the Yankees an early lead with his own home run, Ohtani responded in the bottom of the first inning and then hit his MLB-leading 22nd home run in the sixth to spark a four-run rally. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his rhythm and focus, attributing some of his success to his new lifestyle after the birth of his daughter.

          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers to combat soaring rice prices, with major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. being the first to sell the cheaper products. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags of rice sold out in just 30 minutes, while long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. The government is offering 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022, with Ito-Yokado securing 5,000 tons and Iris Ohyama 10,000 tons. This effort marks a shift from previous auctions, as the government hopes direct sales will be more effective in curbing rice prices.</p>

These tokens can be used to make changes to the gamecard, such as marking a square as correct, swapping a team, or making a random change. After a certain time, the gamecard is locked, and users take that card into the evening's games. Extra time is considered for scoring in the knockout stages, but penalty shootouts are not.</p>
