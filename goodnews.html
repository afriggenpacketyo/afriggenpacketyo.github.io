          <p>England's women's cricket team began their World Cup campaign with a decisive 10-wicket victory over South Africa in Guwahati. The English bowlers, led by spinner Linsey Smith, dismissed South Africa for a mere 69 runs, their third-lowest total in one-day international history. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, comfortably reached the target, providing a significant boost to their net run-rate. This commanding win places England in a strong position early in the tournament.</p>

A former chief nurse for the NHS, Mullally became the Bishop of London in 2018 and will now succeed Justin Welby, who resigned following a safeguarding scandal. In her first statement, she addressed the recent synagogue attack in Manchester and pledged to confront the church's past safeguarding failures.

          <p>Microsoft is scheduled to end its support for the Windows 10 operating system this October, creating a need for many users to upgrade their computers to Windows 11. For those concerned about transferring data, settings, and programs, experts advise a systematic approach involving a full backup of all files and accounts to both an external drive and a cloud service. Before migrating, users should also inventory their software and gather necessary license keys to ensure a smooth transition. Microsoft is offering a temporary support extension for Windows 10 until 2026 for users who meet certain criteria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The musical genre of cumbia, originally from Colombia, has found a vibrant and enduring home in the migrant neighborhoods of Monterrey, Mexico. This subculture is driven by "sonideros," DJs who have curated and evolved the sound since the 1960s, accidentally creating the slowed-down "cumbia rebajada" style. For decades, the scene was associated with gang culture and was forced indoors during periods of intense cartel violence. Now, as the city has become safer, cumbia has returned to the streets, with new generations embracing the unique dance and cultural identity.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," characterized by inflated valuations and widespread investor excitement. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he noted that during such periods, both good and bad ideas receive funding, making it difficult for investors to distinguish between them. However, Bezos emphasized that the underlying technology is "real" and will ultimately deliver "gigantic" benefits to society by transforming every industry. He compared the situation to past bubbles which eventually produced revolutionary companies despite initial volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, law enforcement in Austin, Texas, announced a major breakthrough in the infamous 1991 yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. New DNA and ballistics technology has identified Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer, as the likely perpetrator. The new evidence also serves to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crimes in 1999 based on coerced confessions and later freed. This development in the high-profile cold case offers long-awaited answers to the victims' families and highlights the power of modern forensic science.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under significant pressure from industry groups and some celebrity chefs as he considers signing a bill to ban the sale of cookware containing PFAS, known as "forever chemicals." The legislation, passed by the state legislature, aims to reduce exposure to these toxic compounds linked to serious health problems. A trade group representing major cookware manufacturers is leading the opposition, arguing the ban is unnecessary. Public health and environmental advocates are urging Newsom to sign the bill, framing it as a crucial step to eliminate avoidable uses of these dangerous chemicals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the investment "winter" for property technology has ended, with recent IPOs and new unicorns signaling a market recovery. However, he noted that the climate-related subsector of property tech is struggling significantly due to a negative shift in political sentiment away from sustainability and decarbonization efforts. While national policy has become less supportive, Wallace remains optimistic for the long term, citing that local governments are increasingly turning to carbon taxes. Fifth Wall continues to invest in the space, taking advantage of lower valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physical music formats like vinyl records are exempt from the Trump administration's recent rollback of the "de minimis" rule, which now applies tariffs to many imported goods valued under $800. This protection comes from the Berman Amendment, a Cold War-era law that prevents the regulation of "informational materials." The exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl record industry, which has seen massive growth driven by artists like Taylor Swift. While fans and labels benefit, some U.S.-based manufacturers argue that applying tariffs to foreign-pressed records would support domestic jobs.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered advice to a 51-year-old Arkansas mother who called his show with no retirement savings. He calculated that by consistently investing 15% of her income and utilizing her employer's 401(k) match, she could accumulate between $600,000 and $800,000 by the time she turns 70. Ramsey emphasized a disciplined, math-driven approach to saving and investing to overcome the late start. The advice highlights a common fear among many Americans who feel behind on retirement goals, but it shows a secure future is possible with focused effort. (not investment advice)</p>
