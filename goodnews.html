          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9 to allow time for negotiations. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious trade talks. Trump had previously threatened the tariffs, citing difficulties in trade negotiations with the EU, which caused stock market instability. Von der Leyen affirmed the EU's readiness for swift and decisive talks, acknowledging the importance of the EU-U.S. trade relationship.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is preparing to deliver a significant speech in Canada's parliament, expected to offer support amid Canada's dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. The King and Queen Camilla received a warm welcome upon their arrival in Ottawa for their first Canadian trip since the start of Charles's reign. Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment, invited the King to deliver the speech at the opening of parliament, a symbolic show of support for Canada's sovereignty, and it will be the first time in almost 50 years that a monarch gives the "Speech from the throne."</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the former dean of New York‚Äôs congressional delegation and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, passed away at the age of 94. Elected to Congress in 1970, he served longer than any other New Yorker except Emanuel Celler, retiring in 2016 after winning his 23rd term. Despite being censured for ethics violations in 2010, he remained a respected figure, known for his gregariousness and political agility. Rangel played a key role in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate from New York in 2000 and was a leading voice for Harlem.</p>

          <p>The government is shifting apprenticeship funding in England to prioritize training opportunities for individuals under 21, pulling funding from postgraduate apprenticeships. Controversial plans will restrict funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, to those under 21, potentially impacting advanced NHS training. The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults by increasing a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK. Critics argue the changes will harm public services and limit professional opportunities for those not attending university.</p>
