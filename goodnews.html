          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands the Warm Home Discount. The changes mean anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the discount, regardless of property size. While debt charities welcome the move, some express concern that the scheme still excludes some vulnerable individuals. The government says any potential bill increases to cover the cost will be offset by savings made by cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt.</p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by honoring the role quilts may have played in the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that runaway enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to navigate north, with patterns conveying messages to those seeking freedom. While some historians doubt the practice due to a lack of written records, others argue the secrecy surrounding the Underground Railroad explains the absence of documentation. Edmunds hopes to educate younger generations about the brave plight of those who sought freedom.</p>
