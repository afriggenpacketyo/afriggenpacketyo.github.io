          <h2>Violent Crime Rates in the US Experience Significant Decline After Pandemic Spike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the remarkable drop in violent crime rates in the US after a surge during the pandemic. The FBI's 2023 crime report showed a nearly 12% decrease in murders year over year, with further declines in 2024 and early 2025. Factors contributing to this decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and government initiatives like community violence interruption programs. While acknowledging that the situation is not perfect, the article highlights that most Americans are unaware of these positive trends due to bad news bias, which focuses on outlier events and can hinder support for effective reforms.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes on the final day of the Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes and causing traffic disruptions. Police suspect arson as the cause, citing a fire at a substation, though a connection to the festival is unconfirmed. The festival organizers quickly switched to an alternative power supply, ensuring the closing ceremony proceeded as planned, but morning screenings were temporarily interrupted. Despite the blackout, the festival continued, with Juliette Binoche and her jury announcing the winners of the top prizes at the closing ceremony, demonstrating the event's resilience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and generate substantial revenue for the government. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and raise housing prices. The government created Fannie and Freddie to stabilize the housing market, but they were placed under federal conservatorship after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, marking a significant milestone in underwater communication. The feat, detailed in a study published in Acta Acustica, demonstrates the potential for long-range undersea messaging with both civilian and military applications. Led by Professor He Chengbing, the project team developed a self-tuning system that can map signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography, which is critical for naval applications. This advancement could pave the way for reliable communication with underwater drones and synchronized operations.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain due to a rare condition called pericardial constriction, which occurred after contracting COVID-19. Doctors initially struggled to diagnose the cause of his swelling and fatigue, but cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition based on images of Mauceri's heart. Open-heart surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, revealed Mauceri's heart was trapped inside a thick shell of scarring, which was carefully removed. Mauceri recovered quickly after the surgery and was able to conduct an orchestra again, expressing gratitude for the added time in his life.</p>

Through Devon's outsider perspective, the show satirizes the lives of the ultra-rich and delves into the power dynamics between women, blurring lines between obligation and intimacy.

          <p>Despite critics claiming the movement to defund the police failed, some cities like Austin and Seattle are seeing progress. These cities have redirected funds from law enforcement to social services and new public safety departments. Milwaukee allocated funds to affordable housing and youth programming, while Seattle invested in participatory budgeting and a third public safety department for mental health crises. Austin increased investment in homeless services. Though public sentiment shifted after 2020, these initiatives have sparked conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety, and organizers hope the Trump administration's focus on law enforcement will inspire renewed support for alternatives.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week. This trend has stabilized since 2023, becoming a defining feature of the UK labor market, driven by factors like commuting costs and the desire for flexibility. Despite some companies mandating a return to the office, many workers, particularly women and parents, would resist strict return policies. The research suggests hybrid work is now the expectation, with no strong evidence of reduced productivity, though the impact of fully remote roles varies.</p>

          <p>A taskforce of experts is planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles in Florida to reverse the destruction of coral reefs. Record ocean heat has accelerated the decline of reefs in the Florida Keys, which have lost 90% of their healthy coral cover. The project, involving the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium, aims to restore the reefs with the resilient elkhorn coral species. The teams will monitor the coral's progress, hoping to inform future recovery efforts and combat the devastating effects of climate change.</p>
