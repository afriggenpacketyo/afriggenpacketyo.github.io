        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kamala Harris's recently released memoir, "107 Days," offers a candid account of her presidential campaign, attributing its ultimate failure partly to insufficient time and perceived interference from then-President Joe Biden's staff. She recounts a distracting phone call from Biden shortly before a crucial debate, where he raised rumors about her loyalty, causing her significant distress. The article also reveals her preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate and her assessment of Josh Shapiro's "unrealistic expectation" for the Vice President's role. Furthermore, Harris reflects on a damaging gaffe during "The View," where her inability to articulate differences with Biden provided ample ammunition for the opposing campaign, underscoring the intense pressures and missteps of her political journey.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison and reunited with his family after nearly six years of detention in Egypt. Considered one of the country's most prominent political prisoners, his pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi reportedly followed a request from the National Council for Human Rights, a significant development in his long-standing case. Abdel Fattah was originally arrested in 2019 and sentenced to five years for "spreading false news," specifically for sharing a social media post about a prisoner dying from torture. His family, including his mother who undertook an extensive hunger strike, expressed immense joy at his freedom, though they emphasized that true celebration would come when all political prisoners are released.</p>

          <p>China is actively pursuing the creation of a unique foreign relations knowledge system, aiming to explain its foreign policy and global role more effectively to the international community, independent of Western conceptual frameworks. Zheng Yongnian, a dean at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, underscored the strategic importance of this intellectual autonomy as a key component of Beijing's broader push for global influence. This initiative aligns closely with China's recently introduced Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar and inclusive global order emphasizing sovereign equality, shared development, and multilateral cooperation. The article highlights China's ambition to articulate its international relations perspective independently, moving away from Western-centric theories like realism and liberalism.</p>

The article underscores how these plans not only inform but also profoundly reflect Beijing’s high-level policy priorities and strategic ambitions. This forthcoming iteration is particularly significant, as it will reveal China's approach to continued development amidst a changing global landscape and its commitment to long-term, centralized planning in the post-reform era.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order compelling the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants, providing substantial relief to the University of California system. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the administration's suspension of these grants, ostensibly due to allegations of campus antisemitism and other issues, likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the form letters used were unspecific to the research. This preliminary injunction, which also includes other federal grants, effectively halts a funding crisis that had threatened significant layoffs and the closure of critical labs. The article highlights a successful judicial intervention safeguarding vital scientific research and academic operations from executive overreach.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual pannage season, a historic tradition dating back to 1079 that serves a vital ecological purpose. These free-roaming pigs are tasked with grazing on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are poisonous to the forest's other livestock, including ponies and cattle. The verderers initiated the season due to an abundant acorn crop, emphasizing its importance for maintaining the New Forest's delicate ecosystem and supporting the husbandry of its diverse animal population. Visitors are reminded to keep a safe distance from the pigs and drive cautiously through the forest to prevent accidents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a significant reduction in federal grants for animal testing, canceling nearly $28 million, as major federal health agencies pivot towards phasing out research on live animals. This shift is driven by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress, aiming to curtail the estimated $20 billion annual federal spending on animal experiments. While animal tests have historically been crucial for developing vaccines and medications, the FDA is now exploring new alternatives like AI-based computational modeling and lab testing on human organs.
