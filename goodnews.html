          <p>Rep. Troy Downing recounts his experience of being on a moose hunting trip in the Alaskan wilderness when the 9/11 attacks occurred. With limited communication, he and his friend initially feared a nuclear holocaust when they noticed the absence of air traffic. Upon returning to civilization, Downing was inspired to enlist in the Air Force at the age of 34. He emphasizes the unity that followed the attacks and the importance of supporting veterans.

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has been charged by the Football Association with 74 alleged rule breaches related to payments to agents between 2009 and 2022. The charges primarily concern transfers between 2010 and 2016, involving players like Eden Hazard, Samuel Eto'o, and Willian. Chelsea self-reported the potential breaches to the FA and is cooperating with the investigation. Possible sanctions range from fines to transfer embargoes or points deductions, though the club expects no sporting sanctions due to their cooperation. The club previously faced a fine from UEFA for breaking Financial Fair Play rules.</p>

          <p>Australia will invest $1.1 billion to develop and deploy a fleet of locally-built underwater attack drones, known as "Ghost Sharks." The drones, designed for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations, will be delivered to the Australian navy starting in January. These long-range, autonomous vehicles will enhance Australia's undersea warfare capabilities, complementing its future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The move is part of Australia's strategy to address potential threats to its sea routes and bolster its defense capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The initiative reflects a proactive approach to national security.</p>
