          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his retirement, naming Greg Abel as his successor by the end of the year. Buffett, known as the 'Oracle of Omaha,' has transformed Berkshire Hathaway into a $1.16 trillion investment firm over six decades. He intends to remain involved and will not sell his Berkshire stock, which will eventually be donated to charity. Apple CEO Tim Cook praised Buffett's legacy, noting Abel's readiness. The announcement came as Buffett criticized President Trump's trade policies, urging for global trade rather than using trade as a weapon.</p>

The new municipality would have power over planning, taxation, and local issues, but some nearby residents oppose the measure, citing environmental concerns.

          <p>Warren Buffett's announcement to step down defined the Berkshire Hathaway meeting, with Greg Abel set to succeed him.
