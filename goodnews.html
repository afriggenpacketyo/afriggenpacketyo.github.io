          <h2>Los Angeles Clippers Strongly Considering Signing Veteran Guard Chris Paul</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 18:08:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The LA Clippers are actively considering bringing veteran point guard Chris Paul back to the franchise, according to president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank. Frank praised Paul as a "great player" and "great Clipper," noting his playmaking abilities would fit the team's strategy. At 40, Paul played all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs last season and would join a guard-heavy roster including James Harden and Bradley Beal. The team believes adding more playmakers will help manage the workload for its aging stars and enhance roster versatility for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national team has advanced to the Euro 2025 semifinals after a dramatic 6-5 penalty shootout victory over France. The German squad played with only 10 players for over 100 minutes after Kathrin Hendrich received an early red card, leading to a French penalty goal. Despite the setback, Germany equalized and held on through extra time, with goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger making a crucial save in the shootout to secure the win.

          <h2>Interest in Learning Mandarin Declines in Western Countries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 18:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of rapid growth, the popularity of learning Mandarin is waning in the United States and other Western nations. University enrollments for Mandarin in the US have dropped by 25% from their 2013 peak, with similar declines observed in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This "huge shift" reflects changing geopolitical perceptions and career incentives that once positioned Mandarin as the language of the future. While interest is still growing modestly in some European countries, it is being outpaced by other, more popular languages.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharge incidents from water companies in half by 2030. This marks the first time a specific target has been set on the issue, following public outrage over waterway pollution. The announcement comes after data showed serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high, while water company executives received millions in bonuses. The government's plan also includes a ban on plastic-containing wet wipes and efforts to reduce phosphorus pollution from treated wastewater.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred while she was performing her hit song "Roar" high above the audience. Perry quickly recovered from the apparent scare and continued her performance without interruption, later flying back to the stage on the prop. After the song, she humorously commented, "Not today, Satan," acknowledging the brief but startling malfunction during her "The Lifetimes Tour" show.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy experienced a roller-coaster third round at The Open, marked by both bizarre luck and brilliant play that kept his title hopes alive. A strange moment occurred when his shot from the rough dislodged a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey, but he quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole. The crowd at Portrush roared with support as the Northern Irishman shot a 66, leaving him six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler. Despite the deficit, McIlroy feels he has given himself at least a "half-chance" for a dramatic final-day comeback.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to strengthen security cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. This strategic shift, highlighted by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over the future of US security guarantees for Europe under President Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK could supplement or even replace US protection. The move reflects a recognition that European nations must take greater responsibility for their own defense.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, initially on a loan with an option to buy. Rashford has been an outcast at Old Trafford since last December and was told to train separately after expressing a desire to leave. For Barcelona, the move is a strategic one after failing to sign other targets for their forward line, and the loan structure suits their ongoing financial constraints. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is betting that the 27-year-old could be a major asset in La Liga.</p>

Analysts describe it as a technology capable of performing incredibly complex calculations instantly, which could "warp-speed" human knowledge and development. Potential applications include creating new drugs and materials, enhancing AI, and revolutionizing logistics and encryption. While major milestones have been achieved, the article notes that a quantum computer has not yet solved a useful, real-world problem faster than a classical computer. (not investment advice)</p>
