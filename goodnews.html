        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is pushing for the National Guard's deployment to San Francisco, a move met with strong opposition from local officials, including Mayor Daniel Lurie. This comes as the city is undergoing a significant post-pandemic resurgence, largely fueled by the booming artificial intelligence industry, with venture capital funding expected to surpass previous records. Crime rates have reportedly decreased, and tourism and real estate markets are showing recovery. While Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially supported Trump's call, he later reversed his position after facing criticism. Mayor Lurie emphasizes that existing law enforcement partnerships are sufficient and that federal troops lack the authority to address local drug crimes effectively, framing the city's progress as a testament to local efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "No Kings" protests, drawing millions nationwide, represent a significant surge in American civic participation, particularly in opposition to President Trump's perceived authoritarianism. These demonstrations, occurring across diverse towns and cities, provide an outlet for citizens apprehensive about current policies and aim to sustain momentum through future elections. The article highlights that these protests, despite not causing immediate political change, challenge the perception of Trump's invincibility and send a message to political and corporate entities considering alignment with his administration. Trump's own reactions, including threatening the Insurrection Act and posting an inflammatory AI video, underscore the impact these popular movements are having.</p>

          <p>Atlanta police successfully averted a potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, thanks to a crucial tip from the suspect's family. Billy Cagle, 49, was arrested inside the South Terminal after his family reported he was livestreaming threats to "shoot it up" at the airport. Officers located an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside. Authorities believe Cagle, a felon with mental health issues, was scouting the terminal before retrieving his weapon. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens praised the collaboration between community and law enforcement for preventing a tragedy, emphasizing the dangers when mental health and firearms intersect.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer emphasized the importance of holding Apple stock, rather than trading it, as the company's shares surged to a record high. This rally was driven by strong demand for its iPhone 17 lineup and bullish analyst calls, despite previous market negativity concerning issues like China sales and Siri. Cramer highlighted Apple's robust product cycle, pricing stability, and its ability to monetize its ecosystem, such as Alphabet paying over $20 billion for Google to be the default search engine. He suggested Apple could adopt a similar strategy for AI integration, generating high margins without significant investment in its own models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panama's Minister of Canal Affairs, Jose Ramon Icaza, revealed that the government is actively planning for various scenarios concerning CK Hutchison's concession to operate the vital Balboa and Cristobal ports. This strategic preparation is in response to lawsuits filed by the comptroller general, which challenge the constitutionality of the 2021 contract renewal. The government is developing a contingency plan to ensure a seamless takeover by the Panama Maritime Authority, should the Supreme Court rule against the concession extension, thereby preventing supply chain disruptions. Additionally, the possibility of reaching a mutual agreement with CK Hutchison for a structured transition of the port concessions is also being explored, underscoring the delicate balance between legal compliance and operational continuity.</p>

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive Robert E. Lee statue, have been transformed into a powerful art exhibition in Los Angeles, directly contrasting with President Trump's call for their reinstallation. Curator Hamza Walker asserts that these statues perpetuate the "Lost Cause ideology" and white supremacy, arguing that the Civil War was fundamentally about slavery. The exhibition, "Monuments," displays melted-down bronze and graffitied equestrian statues alongside contemporary art, prompting a re-evaluation of American history. Artist Kara Walker's "Unmanned Drone" reinterprets Stonewall Jackson as a "haint," aiming to deconstruct the mythology of white supremacy. This article highlights the ongoing cultural and political battle over historical memory and public symbols.</p>
