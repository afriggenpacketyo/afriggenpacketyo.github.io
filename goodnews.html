          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held their first formal talks in six years in Beijing, a significant diplomatic event following their joint appearance at China's Victory Day parade. The meeting, which included Russia's Vladimir Putin at the parade, was interpreted as a deliberate show of unity against the West. This marked Kim's first appearance on a multilateral stage since taking power and represents a key moment in his diplomatic outreach, historically reliant on Beijing's support.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests AI Has Changed How Students Cheat, Not Necessarily How Many</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An education researcher argues that the panic over students using AI to cheat is misplaced, as evidence suggests the technology has primarily changed the method rather than the overall frequency of cheating. Studies indicate that cheating rates were already high before the advent of generative AI like ChatGPT. The article explores the nuances of AI use in academics, noting that students use it for various purposes from brainstorming to generating entire essays, creating a complex challenge for educators to define new rules and expectations.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka has reached the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 Grand Slam tournaments, a level of consistency unmatched in women's tennis. However, her powerful style has often been undermined by a tendency to lose emotional control at critical moments, resulting in only three titles from those deep runs. As she prepares for the US Open semi-final against Jessica Pegula, her team, now including doubles champion Max Mirnyi, is focused on helping her manage these fluctuations to secure another major victory.</p>

          <p>The world's largest illegal live sports streaming service, Streameast, has been shut down following a collaborative effort between the anti-piracy group Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) and Egyptian police. The site had amassed over 1.6 billion visits in the past year by providing unauthorized access to major sporting events like Premier League football. Two men were arrested in Egypt, where authorities also seized equipment and uncovered a shell company allegedly used for laundering millions in advertising revenue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta is reportedly considering suing the Football Association (FA) after an independent commission cleared him of spot-fixing allegations. The charges, which led to the collapse of an £80 million transfer to Manchester City, were dismissed, and the commission's written findings criticized the FA's case. Specifically, the report questioned the FA's decision to rely on its own investigator for betting data analysis rather than an independent expert, calling it an "obvious flaw."</p>

          <p>A feature article delves into the complex decision of what to do with a beloved but old vehicle that is becoming too costly to maintain. It explores the three main paths: selling it for a low price, donating it to a charity that can repair it for a family in need, or sending it to an environmentally certified salvage yard for recycling. The piece provides a detailed look at the auto recycling industry, where vehicles are methodically demanufactured to salvage valuable parts before the remaining metal is crushed and repurposed.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of over a billion job postings reveals that workers with AI skills are commanding significantly higher salaries, with an average premium of nearly $18,000 per year. The study found that jobs requiring at least one AI skill paid 28% more than those with none, and this trend was most pronounced in non-tech sectors such as sales, customer support, and manufacturing. This indicates a broad and growing demand for AI literacy across the entire labor market, not just within specialized technology roles.</p>

          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange has proposed new listing requirements that would make it more difficult for small Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. The key change would require companies operating primarily in China to raise a minimum of $25 million in their initial public offering. This move is a response to a recent flood of microcap Chinese IPOs that have been linked to manipulative trading schemes and pose a higher risk to investors, coming amid broader U.S.-China financial and political tensions.</p>
