          <p>The newly formed Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to play in a FIFA-backed tournament, marking their first official international appearance in four years. Since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, women have been banned from sports in Afghanistan, forcing these players to flee the country. Now based in nations like Australia and the UK, the team's participation is a significant step towards official recognition and serves as a powerful symbol of resilience for women silenced in their homeland.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's defense ministry has not observed any large-scale military activity from China's People's Liberation Army in the week following a major policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai. Beijing, which considers Lai a "troublemaker" for his pro-sovereignty stance, has previously responded to such events with massive military drills intended as a warning. The current lack of escalation suggests a period of relative calm in the Taiwan Strait, though tensions remain high.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece celebrates the decisions of two federal district court judges who blocked President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The article praises the judges for courageously challenging the executive branch, finding that the administration's justifications for the deployments were "untethered to the facts." The author argues these rulings are a vital defense of constitutional law against potential military overreach and the establishment of martial law in American cities.</p>
