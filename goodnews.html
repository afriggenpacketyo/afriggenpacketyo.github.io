          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 03:50:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has approved plans for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a £2.2 billion privately-financed project designed to boost economic growth. This expansion involves adapting the existing Northern Runway for regular use, aiming to increase annual flights from approximately 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s, thereby creating thousands of jobs and attracting billions in investment. While the government and Labour support the project as a vital economic opportunity, it faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who criticize it as an environmental disaster. The approval includes new conditions for stricter noise controls, enhanced insulation schemes for nearby residents, and targets for increased public transport usage by passengers.</p>

          <p>Germany's public transportation usage saw a modest increase in 2025, though the initial boom from the Deutschlandticket is waning as its price rises, raising concerns about passengers returning to private cars. In response, Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder is set to unveil a new strategy for the troubled state-owned rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), including introducing its new chief executive, Evelyn Palla, who will be the railway's first female chief. Schnieder previously described DB's situation as "dramatic," emphasizing the need for more punctual, secure, and cleaner services, alongside a quicker, leaner, and more economically productive company structure to address long-standing issues.</p>

          <p>The article reviews "Silent Hill f," celebrating it as one of the series' boldest and best entries, a remarkable achievement after a decade of middling releases. It praises the game's psychological horror, which delves into the fragility of the human mind within a unique 1960s Japan setting. The narrative skillfully explores how societal and cultural pressures contribute to the protagonist's descent into madness, constantly draping the story in ambiguity. The reviewer commends the artful cutscenes, relentless pacing, and intelligent puzzles, despite a minor critique regarding combat frequency. This article positions "Silent Hill f" as an atmospheric and narrative triumph.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology have developed a groundbreaking ultrasonic device capable of efficiently removing salt from sea sand. This innovative solution addresses the increasing scarcity and cost of river sand, a critical construction material, by making abundant sea sand viable for use. Sea sand's salt content typically causes corrosion in metal rebar, compromising building integrity, but this new method desalinates it more efficiently, using a 2-to-1 water-to-sand ratio, significantly less than traditional methods. This article highlights the technology's potential to enhance structural integrity, offer economic feasibility for builders, and mitigate the environmental impact associated with river sand extraction.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated to the BBC his willingness to accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that would freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production. Lee views this as a "feasible, realistic alternative" and an "interim emergency measure" given North Korea's continued development of 15-20 new weapons annually, rather than insisting on immediate denuclearization. He believes that mutual trust between Trump and Kim could facilitate renewed talks, aiming to reduce regional tensions and contribute to global peace.
