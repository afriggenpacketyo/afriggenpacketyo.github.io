          <h2>Georgia Law Could Reduce Sentences for Domestic Violence Survivors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 20:18:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law in Georgia, the Survivor Justice Act, may allow domestic violence survivors to seek reduced sentences if they can prove abuse led them to commit crimes. Latoya Dickens, convicted of felony murder after a fight with her abusive husband, could potentially have her sentence reduced under this law. The law aims to consider the full context of abuse that may have influenced a defendant's actions. The legislation is not a 'get out of jail free card,' but it provides an opportunity for a fair review of cases where abuse played a significant role.</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime in schools to combat the decline in outdoor play among children. The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that children are increasingly confined indoors with digital devices due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updated planning policies and government guidance to protect playtime in schools. Some councils have begun removing these signs to encourage children to exercise more and engage in outdoor activities.</p>
