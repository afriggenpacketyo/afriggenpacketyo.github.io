          <p>Archaeologists excavating the grounds of a Revolutionary War-era gunpowder magazine at Colonial Williamsburg unexpectedly discovered the remains of four Civil War soldiers and three amputated legs. The skeletons, dating back to 1862, belonged to Confederate soldiers who died during the Battle of Williamsburg. The soldiers were found with their arms crossed, buried in comfortable clothes rather than uniforms, aligned east-west, a burial tradition commonly associated with Christianity.

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion, "QueerPassion" and "Arabian Passion," explore contemporary issues such as violence against LGBTQ+ people and war and displacement in the Middle East. "QueerPassion" by Thomas H√∂ft incorporates stories of discriminated and murdered queer individuals, while Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" addresses the suffering of people in the Middle East, using Arabic instruments and vocals. Both versions maintain Bach's original musical style while adding new layers of meaning and cultural context. The optimism score is 65.</p>
          <p>65/100</p>
