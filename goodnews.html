          <p>Adolfo "Fito" Macias, the infamous leader of Ecuador's "Los Choneros" gang, has been extradited to the U.S. to face charges of cocaine distribution and firearms violations. This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its citizens to a foreign country. Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." His gang is linked to Mexican cartels and is a key player in the global cocaine trade that has transformed Ecuador into a major transit hub.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight, operating as a Delta Connection service, was forced to take evasive action to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber while on approach to Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the maneuver was necessary after the military aircraft appeared unexpectedly in their flight path. The incident occurred near Minot Air Force Base, which is home to a B-52 squadron. Both SkyWest and the U.S. Air Force have confirmed they are investigating the matter to determine how the two aircraft came into such close proximity.</p>

          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that ten key factors are buoying the stock market. These include strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, and the economic stimulus expected from President Trump's "big beautiful bill," which extends tax cuts and provides new deductions. Other positive drivers identified are increased business tax relief, a potential boom in data center and grid construction, and a more favorable environment for mergers and acquisitions. He suggests these elements could create a powerful economic tailwind. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The 1984 incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent criminal cases against the miners collapsed amid allegations that police falsified evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, expressed cautious elation at the announcement, which aims to finally address unanswered questions about the event and its aftermath.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, drawing on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that the most crucial skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their feelings. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This skill is presented as a powerful buffer against anxiety and a foundation for lifelong mental health.</p>
