          <h2>UK Parliament Members Advocate for Delay in Farm Inheritance Tax Changes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is urging the government to postpone the implementation of farm inheritance tax reforms by a year, citing inadequate consultation and potential harm to small family businesses. The proposed changes, set to begin in April 2026, would tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than ¬£1 million at 20%, a move that has sparked protests across the UK. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee emphasizes the need for alternative schemes that won't negatively impact vulnerable farmers and suggests delaying the policy until April 2027 to allow farmers more time to seek professional advice. The committee also criticizes the sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which affected trust in the government and put many farmers at risk of becoming unviable.</p>

          <p>The Livingston Union School District in California is combating chronic absenteeism by focusing on connection and providing support to students and families. School nurse Lori Morgan plays a key role by contacting parents and visiting homes to address issues contributing to student absences.

The approach recognizes that addressing issues within the family can improve a child's attendance and overall well-being, fostering a sense of belonging and support within the school community.</p>

Luke Donald also defied expectations with a 67, while Matt Fitzpatrick posted a 68 amid his own struggles with form.

          <p>The California Assembly unanimously passed legislation to increase criminal penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex, following weeks of political debate. The bill, initially proposed by Assemblymember Maggy Krell, aims to target perpetrators and increase protections for victims. The legislation now applies only to offenders more than three years older than the victim, a compromise reached after controversy over stripping the felony provision. The bill now heads to the state Senate for consideration, with existing law already penalizing solicitation of a minor under 16 as a misdemeanor or felony.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated that Iran would never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy and would not dismantle its enrichment facilities.

          <p>Walmart's former U.S. CEO, Bill Simon, believes the retailer can easily absorb tariff costs without increasing prices, criticizing the company's "doom and gloom" commentary. Simon suggests that Walmart may be overstating challenges tied to tariffs, given its strong business and expanding gross profit margin. He is optimistic that consumers can largely handle price increases due to a steady jobs market and cheaper fuel prices, but notes that negative commentary from corporate executives could be eroding consumer confidence. Simon's perspective contrasts with Walmart's reported concerns about the impact of tariffs on its business.</p>

However, the move has sparked debate, with Conservatives warning of a "surrender summit" and Reform UK fearing a "great British sellout."
