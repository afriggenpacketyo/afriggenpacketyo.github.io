          <h2>Rubber Duck Museum Relocates to Canada Due to Tariff Instability</h2>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is moving to Canada due to the instability caused by President Trump's tariffs on goods from China and strained relations with Canada. Owners Neil and Krystal King cited a significant drop in Canadian visitors, who feel offended by the rhetoric coming from the White House, as well as 145% tariffs on their Chinese-made rubber ducks. Despite the potential for tariffs to be dropped, the Kings are moving to ensure a sustainable business model, as the uncertainty of daily tariff changes makes planning difficult. The museum's relocation highlights the tangible impact of international trade policies on small businesses reliant on cross-border tourism and trade.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for six weeks, following a judge's order for her release on bail. Ozturk thanked her community and supporters, expressing faith in the American justice system, and mentioned the support she received during her detention. A federal judge in Vermont cited a lack of evidence for her detainment beyond an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas, arguing that her First Amendment rights were violated. Ozturk's lawyers emphasized her worsening asthma while in detention and the court will weigh the standing of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.</p>

Her testimony, along with that of another ex-girlfriend and physical evidence, led to Doyle's conviction for second-degree murder.

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that a new oral medication, zongertinib, shows promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The medication targets the HER2 protein, blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which signals cell growth. The trial was conducted at 82 sites worldwide, including institutions in the US, China, and Japan.</p>

The walkway will include soil-covered surfaces planted with trees and flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, and event spaces, with cafes and food trucks planned.

The loss also highlighted a troubling trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records, losing eight of their last eleven games against such opponents.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about the impact on state finances. Senior officials have been dismissive of such a cut as the government prepares an economic package before the House of Councillors election. While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions and alternative support methods for those in need. He also stated that Japan would continue to seek a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

Its involvement dates back to the ‚Äúalternative crop cultivation programme,‚Äù which aimed to reduce opium production by sharing agricultural technology.

While some may view the service with skepticism, Wood emphasizes the platonic and nurturing nature, screening clients and obtaining consent to establish boundaries.

          <p>An atmospheric river, typically affecting the Western U.S., is forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the Southeastern United States, potentially resulting in 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated areas seeing up to 12 inches. The event, impacting Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, is due to a "cutoff low" diverting the jet stream from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean. While this event could alleviate recent drought conditions in Florida, there is a risk of flooding and flash floods, prompting warnings for residents to take precautions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that a winning Eurovision song should incorporate lyrical themes of self-assertion or empowerment, and use a minor key to signal emotional depth. Simple and effective staging is key, avoiding over-the-top performances that overshadow the music. Songs should be catchy with a surprise twist, such as a key change or costume reveal, and embrace the quirky and LGBT-friendly elements that Eurovision fans appreciate. While the perfect formula remains elusive, these elements can increase a song's chances of standing out and capturing the hearts of the audience.</p>
