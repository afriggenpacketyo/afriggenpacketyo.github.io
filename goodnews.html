          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. The club, currently 19th in the Premier League, sacked Potter after a string of poor results, including only three points from the first five league games this season. Nuno, who previously managed Nottingham Forest and led them to their highest league finish in decades, was dismissed from his former role just three games into the current season. He now takes on the challenge of improving West Ham's performance and league position.</p>

Hardy's distinguished military career also included service in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and in retirement, he became a dedicated advocate for the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen.

He lives on approximately $4,000 a month from various sources, including VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English, which affords him an upper-middle-class lifestyle. Ryan contrasts the high-pressure, survival-focused environment he felt in America with the calmer, more purpose-driven life he can lead in Vietnam.

He became famous in Europe for his work on German television, particularly for his unconventional and insightful interview show "Personenbeschreibung," where he profiled international figures like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen.

          <h2>Dating Apps Turn to AI for More Thoughtful Matchmaking Amid User Burnout</h2>

          <p>Dating app companies, including Bumble and Match Group, are increasingly integrating advanced AI to combat user swipe fatigue and create more meaningful connections. Founders like Whitney Wolfe Herd envision AI acting as an "emotionally intelligent matchmaker," using large language models to pair users based on deeper values and life goals rather than superficial profiles. However, experts remain skeptical, pointing out that romantic chemistry is complex and unpredictable. Past experiments have shown that the suggestion of compatibility can be more powerful than actual algorithmic matching, raising questions about whether AI can truly solve the mysteries of human connection.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old Miami girl named Imani Dell was diagnosed with a fast-growing brain tumor after her aunt observed that her eyes were crossed. Her mother, initially thinking it was due to tablet use, sought medical help when Imani began seeing double, leading to the discovery of a golf-ball sized medulloblastoma. Surgeons successfully removed the tumor, and Imani has since completed a difficult year-long regimen of radiation and chemotherapy. Now in remission, she has returned to school, and her family is celebrating her recovery and return to a normal childhood.</p>

          <h2>New Cockpit Alerts Aim to Prevent Runway Collisions at Airports</h2>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is developing advanced cockpit alert systems designed to give pilots more time to react and prevent runway incursions, which have seen a recent spike. The technology, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide automated audio and visual warnings of potential collisions on the ground or during takeoff and landing. Amid concerns over airport safety, the NTSB and FAA have urged the adoption of such systems. While not yet required by regulators, some airlines like Alaska and Southwest have already implemented similar tools to enhance situational awareness.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves mixing soda with flavored syrups and cream, has exploded from its origins in Utah to become a national phenomenon influencing major food and beverage companies. Brands like PepsiCo are launching ready-to-drink versions, while fast-food chains such as Taco Bell and McDonald's are experimenting with their own customized soda creations. The trend's appeal lies in its affordability, customizability, and accessibility, helping to revitalize the sluggish carbonated soft drink category. This foodservice innovation is successfully crossing over into the retail market, boosting soda consumption for the first time in years.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece revisits the landmark 1977 case where the ACLU defended the right of neo-Nazis to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors. The author reflects on the painful yet crucial principle that the First Amendment must protect even offensive and hateful speech to be effective. David Goldberger, the ACLU lawyer who argued the case, acknowledges the deep pain it caused survivors but maintains that allowing officials to ban speech they find offensive creates a dangerous precedent. The article suggests this historical event offers a unifying lesson on free speech in today's polarized times.</p>

          <p>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, with its legacy kept alive by dedicated fan groups and midnight screenings worldwide. In Michigan, the Rocky Horror Preservation Society continues the tradition of "shadowcasting," where performers act out the movie in costume below the screen, and encouraging audience call-and-response participation. For many fans, the film and its community have provided a safe space for self-expression, particularly for queer and neurodivergent individuals. The enduring appeal lies in its celebration of being different and the communal, immersive experience it fosters.</p>
