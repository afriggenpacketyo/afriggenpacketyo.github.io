          <p>The United States is reportedly preparing to retrofit a Boeing jumbo jet donated by Qatar to be used as Air Force One for President Donald Trump. The $400 million aircraft was given as an "unconditional" gift, with the U.S. government bearing the cost of necessary modifications and security inspections. The deal has drawn criticism from both political allies and detractors, though the White House insists it is legal. The memorandum of understanding states the donation is a "bone fide gift," and the plane will be donated to Trump's presidential library after his term.</p>

          <p>A new study from Swiss universities suggests that the human immune system can be activated merely by the sight of a perceived infection, even in a virtual environment. Researchers showed participants VR avatars of faces, some of which appeared sick, and monitored their brain activity and blood samples. The results showed that viewing sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered an immune response involving innate lymphoid cells. This finding opens up potential therapeutic applications, such as using VR to modulate immunity or treat allergies through controlled exposure.</p>

This article analyzes how clubs like Arsenal are now seeking dedicated No. 9s to convert chances, leading to a shuffle of top strikers like Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres.
