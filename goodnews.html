        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recently passed budget bill, touting it as the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while dismissing concerns about its potential to increase federal deficits. This comes as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis suggesting the tax provisions within the bill could add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Several Republican senators, including fiscal conservatives, have expressed reservations about the bill, signaling potential changes in the Senate. Johnson, however, refuted the CBO's analysis, claiming it "dramatically overstated" the projected deficits and asserting that the bill will stimulate economic growth through wage increases and incentivizing U.S. manufacturing.

          <p>Lando Norris of the McLaren team won the Monaco Grand Prix, followed by Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri. The race saw a virtual safety car deployment early on due to a crash, but the front-runners mostly followed a straightforward strategy, beginning on medium tires and switching to hard tires. Red Bull tried an inverted strategy with Max Verstappen, who started on hards, switching to mediums, and delaying his final pit stop as late as possible. This strategy ultimately failed, as Verstappen had to pit with one lap to go, dropping him to fourth place.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, a move interpreted as a strong statement of Canada's sovereignty and independence amid growing tensions with the U.S. and President Donald Trump. The invitation marks a shift from previous Liberal governments, highlighting a renewed embrace of the Crown. The visit, the first by a British monarch to deliver Canada's throne speech since 1977, comes at a time when Canada seeks to assert its unique identity and strengthen ties with Europe, especially given Trump's undermining of Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis has sparked debate among experts regarding prostate cancer screening guidelines, particularly for men over 70. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that men aged 55 to 69 discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA screening with their healthcare provider but advises against screenings for men over 70. Some experts argue that this recommendation may be flawed, citing advancements in treatment options and the potential for earlier diagnosis to save lives. They suggest that men over 45 should have this screening, regardless of age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses the debate among conservationists about whether to focus on protecting entire ecosystems rather than individual endangered species. The Trump administration's redefinition of harm to exclude habitat destruction has prompted renewed discussion about the Endangered Species Act's effectiveness. Some argue that protecting ecosystems directly would be more efficient and recognize the dynamic nature of species movement. Others believe that the current ESA can be used more effectively with decisive leadership. The potential for a new ecosystem-protection act could unify diverse interests and create jobs while preserving American landscapes.</p>

          <p>An expert proposes a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs to build resilience, trust, and connection. This approach involves accepting emotions without judgment, responding without shame, viewing behavior as communication, and taking responsibility after conflicts. It emphasizes the importance of parents doing their own internal work to become less reactive and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. By focusing on emotional safety, parents can foster a child's authentic self and well-being.</p>
