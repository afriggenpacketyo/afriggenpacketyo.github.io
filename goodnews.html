          <p>A retired grandfather, Ed Langevin, experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and significant weight loss, which were ultimately diagnosed as symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine. After initial tests failed to identify the problem, a stomach scan revealed the condition, which his doctor had only seen once before. He underwent a minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in the affected artery, which immediately resolved his symptoms and allowed him to eat normally again. His story underscores the importance of patient self-advocacy when facing persistent and unusual health issues.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence boom has fueled an unprecedented surge in the private market, with seven top technology startups, including OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic, reaching a collective valuation of $1.3 trillion. This figure has nearly doubled in the past year, driven primarily by intense investor demand for AI exposure, which now accounts for 77% of all private-market capital raised this year. With such vast sums of private funding available, these companies have little incentive to go public. The immense growth of these private entities is also significantly impacting public markets, boosting stocks of partners and suppliers like Oracle and Broadcom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 89, Robert Redford is being remembered not only for his iconic acting roles in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men," but also for his profound impact as a director and champion of independent cinema. He directed acclaimed films such as "Ordinary People" and established the Sundance Institute and Film Festival, which became a crucial launchpad for generations of visionary filmmakers. By creating this platform, Redford used his own success to foster risk-taking and diverse storytelling, ensuring his influence on the film industry will continue long after his passing.</p>

          <p>Musician Bad Bunny's 10-week concert residency in his native Puerto Rico, titled "I don't want to leave here," has drawn hundreds of thousands of fans to the island, creating a new model of immersive concert tourism. While the event was expected to inject $250 million into the local economy, it also raises complex questions about the impact of such a large influx of visitors. The article explores the tension between the economic benefits of tourism and the potential strain on local resources, culture, and housing markets, particularly in a place already dealing with infrastructure challenges and gentrification. Bad Bunny himself has acknowledged this irony, often addressing these issues within his music.</p>

          <h2>German States Modernize Burial Laws, Allowing River Burials and Home Urns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 07:57:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two German states, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, have significantly updated their burial legislation to reflect changing societal wishes. The new laws will permit ashes to be scattered in major rivers like the Rhine, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from cremated remains. These changes, which also include provisions for Muslim shroud burials and green funerals, respond to a cultural shift where cremation is now favored over traditional burial. While proponents celebrate the move toward personalization, critics from Christian churches and conservative parties worry it may undermine the role of traditional cemeteries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help consumers avoid overspending on a vehicle, financial planners suggest following the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline for affordability. This framework advises making a down payment of at least 20% of the car's price, financing the vehicle for no more than four years, and ensuring that total monthly transportation costs do not exceed 10% of your income. Adhering to these principles can help lower overall interest payments, prevent becoming "underwater" on a loan, and ensure that a depreciating asset like a car doesn't compromise long-term financial goals such as retirement savings.</p>

          <p>In his new book, analyst Dan Wang presents a compelling framework for understanding the competitive dynamics between the U.S. and China, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He observes that while China's leadership is dominated by engineers focused on physical infrastructure and manufacturing, America's governing class is largely composed of lawyers. Wang argues that while this focus has led to issues like high youth unemployment in China, it has also produced remarkable successes in areas like mass transit and clean technology. He provocatively suggests that it is now time for the U.S. to learn from China's physical dynamism.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. According to the National Hurricane Center, the system is currently moving northwest over open waters and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. However, forecasters predict Gabrielle will gradually intensify, likely strengthening into a hurricane by Sunday. While its current track keeps it north of the Caribbean, the storm could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to build strength over the ocean.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, remodeled his family's 1959 house into a "net-zero energy" home that produces more power than it consumes, reportedly for less than the cost of a traditional remodel. The project involved replacing all gas appliances with electric ones, installing rooftop solar panels, and using passive design principles like strategic roof overhangs for natural heating and cooling. Key lessons from the decade-long experience include the necessity of extensive research, being persistent with contractors to stick to the plan, and adapting to a changing climate. The project demonstrates that sustainable living can be both stylish and economically viable.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hailed as the greatest pitcher of his generation, Kershaw was the cornerstone of the franchise's revival, guiding the team through a tumultuous period of bankruptcy and mediocrity to an era of perennial success. His career includes three Cy Young Awards and a legacy of consistent excellence that places him among the all-time Dodger greats. His departure is seen as the end of an era, but one that leaves the team in a far better position than when he arrived.</p>

          <p>Edible insects, particularly caterpillars and palm weevil larvae (maggots), are a significant part of the cuisine and economy in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sold fresh and fried in the markets of Kinshasa, these insects are a staple food source rich in protein and vitamins, often seen as a more accessible alternative to expensive meat. While caterpillar consumption is a long-standing tradition in many parts of the vast country, some research suggests its popularity has grown in recent decades due to economic hardship and the scarcity of bushmeat. Local NGOs are now working to commercialize insect farming to improve food security.</p>

Detained for overstaying a tourist visa, he spent nearly a month in custody, first in a crowded local facility and then in a detention center in Arizona. His case drew attention as an example of "political, collateral damage" from heightened immigration enforcement. After his employer paid his $1,500 bond, Minguela was released and emotionally reunited with his family, though he still faces a long legal battle to avoid deportation.</p>
