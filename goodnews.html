          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred a final decision on Louisiana's controversial congressional map, opting to schedule the case for reargument in its next term. The map, which creates a second majority-Black district, was challenged by a group of voters who claim it constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. This legal battle highlights the difficulty states face in complying with the Voting Rights Act without overly relying on race, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. For now, the map with two majority-Black districts will remain in place, with potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The debut feature film "Familiar Touch" is being praised for its empathetic and nuanced depiction of a woman with dementia. The movie follows Ruth, a cookbook author played by Kathleen Chalfant, as she moves into a memory-care facility. The review highlights the film's focus on Ruth's internal experience and the professional yet compassionate relationship she forms with her caregiver, played by Carolyn Michelle. Chalfant's performance is described as brilliant and award-worthy for portraying a full, complex person rather than just a patient, avoiding common sentimental tropes associated with stories about memory loss and aging.</p>

Despite reporting a 12% drop in sales and a steep decline in net income for the fourth quarter, CEO Elliott Hill stated the company's turnaround plan is working and that results will improve. The company has been working to clear out old inventory, particularly in its classic lines, and is making a new push to win over female shoppers and wholesale partners like Amazon.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 12:23:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While debt settlement can help individuals resolve significant credit card debt for less than the full amount owed, there is a practical limit to its effectiveness. This article suggests that settlement works best for unsecured debts between $7,500 and $75,000. Once debt exceeds $100,000, the process becomes riskier, as creditors are more likely to pursue legal action rather than negotiate. Furthermore, the large lump-sum payments required for high-debt settlements are often unrealistic for individuals to save, and the fees charged by relief companies can become prohibitively expensive, making alternatives like bankruptcy potentially more efficient.

She fought to publish works that were uncompromising in their vision for Black people, resisting industry pressure to cater to white audiences.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic anxieties over inflation, tariffs, and job security. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May, a significant increase from 3.5% in December. This shift away from post-pandemic "revenge spending" is reflected in social media trends like "no buy" challenges and a renewed focus on building emergency funds. Financial experts note that this cautious consumer behavior is a defensive move to create a financial cushion against potential future cost increases and market volatility.</p>

After facing opposition from about 120 of his own MPs, Starmer announced the new rules will now only apply to new claimants, not existing ones. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health component of Universal Credit and will fast-track a support package to help people find work, though some MPs still plan to vote against the bill.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is launching a major turnaround plan for its Ram Trucks brand, which has seen sales decline 38% since 2019. CEO Tim Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement to lead the effort, has promised an aggressive strategy that includes reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, offering an industry-leading warranty, and returning to NASCAR. The brand has lost significant market share to competitors, a situation Kuniskis attributes to past issues with pricing and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500. The revival plan aims to restore dealer confidence and reclaim a market share of over 20% for its full-size trucks.</p>
