          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 16:53:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on data software company Palantir, expressing that he is "inspired" by its high market valuation while also noting its software is the "most expensive" he has ever seen. Despite Salesforce being ten times larger by revenue, Palantir is experiencing much faster growth, making it a popular stock with retail investors. Benioff highlighted that the two companies sometimes compete for government contracts, pointing to a recent U.S. Army deal that Salesforce won over Palantir. The comments underscore the competitive dynamic between the established tech giant and the rapidly growing data analytics firm.</p>

          <p>Great Britain has established a commanding 2-0 lead against Poland in their Davis Cup World Group 1 tennis tie. Cameron Norrie, ranked 34th in the world, secured the first point with a hard-fought victory over Tomasz Berkieta. Following this, Arthur Fery, making an unexpected Davis Cup debut due to an injury to a teammate, won his match against Olaf Pieczkowski. A single additional win on Saturday will advance Great Britain to next year's qualifiers, keeping them in contention for the 2026 title and avoiding a potential relegation play-off.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that his country's forces have successfully thwarted Russia's offensive in the northeastern Sumy region. In a statement following a meeting with military leadership, Zelenskyy asserted that while fighting continues in border areas, the Russian forces there are no longer capable of mounting a major attack. The Russian objective, declared by President Putin in June, was to establish a buffer zone to prevent Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory. Despite this claimed success, Ukrainian military observers note that Russian troops still control over 200 square kilometers of territory within the region.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) showcased a diverse range of potential award contenders and noteworthy independent films. Among the highlights was "Cover-Up," a documentary profiling investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, and Chloé Zhao’s "Hamnet," an adaptation starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley that is already generating significant Oscar buzz. Other notable films included Nia DaCosta’s adaptation of "Hedda Gabler" featuring a powerful performance by Tessa Thompson, and "Fuze," a gripping thriller from director David Mackenzie. The festival served as a critical launchpad for films expected to dominate cinematic conversations in the coming months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion currently held in high-yield money market funds. Some analysts believe this "wall of cash" could flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds as yields on cash-equivalent investments decline. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds belong to institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift into the stock market. They contend that only a return to near-zero interest rates, seen during major economic crises, would trigger a significant outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically to capitalize on the opportunity. Experts recommend that buyers monitor the market closely, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Federal Reserve decisions, meaning the best time to lock in a rate may be fleeting. It is also crucial for applicants to have a high credit score, as the most favorable rates are reserved for the most qualified borrowers. Finally, buyers are reminded of the importance of getting pre-approved to demonstrate seriousness to sellers and to avoid losing a desired home while waiting for even lower rates.

Kamin has previously served on several city commissions and represented the city in a successful lawsuit against the Trump administration over immigration enforcement policies. Mayor Bass described him as a "seasoned leader and status quo disrupter" who will lead her team's efforts.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, weighed in at the same weight as champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez ahead of their highly anticipated super-middleweight title fight in Las Vegas. Both fighters came in just under the 12-stone limit, with the undefeated Crawford appearing impressively conditioned for the heavier division. Crawford is aiming to become the first male boxer in the modern four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes. The bout will see Alvarez defend his four major world titles in a contest that pits Crawford's technical skill against Alvarez's natural power at the weight.</p>
