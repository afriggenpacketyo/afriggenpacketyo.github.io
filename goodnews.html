        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially commenced, establishing lower tariffs on several key exports. The deal gives British car manufacturers preferential access to the U.S. market with a 10% tariff on the first 100,000 vehicles, a significant reduction. In exchange, the UK has eliminated tariffs on U.S. ethanol, a move that has sparked concern within Britain's domestic bioethanol industry about its ability to compete. However, the agreement has not yet resolved the issue of steep U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum, which remain a point of contention.</p>

          <p>Trade negotiations between the United States and Canada are scheduled to resume after Ottawa abandoned its plan to implement a digital services tax (DST). The proposed 3% levy would have affected major U.S. tech companies, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten retaliatory tariffs and halt talks. Canada rescinded the tax just hours before it was to take effect, stating its preference for a multilateral agreement and expressing anticipation for a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S. The two nations share one of the world's largest trading relationships, valued at over $760 billion annually.</p>

The family's package holiday, which included husky rides and snowmobile trips, could not proceed as planned due to unseasonable rain. After initially being offered only a 50% refund, the family appealed to an independent adjudicator who ruled in their favor. The decision found that Tui had not complied with its own "no snow" policy and that the essential purpose of the holiday had been defeated.</p>

          <p>China has announced an immediate but conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially lifting a blanket ban imposed in 2023. The ban was enacted after Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure will not apply to seafood from ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo, which remain under suspension. This move represents a slight thaw in trade relations, which had been strained by the controversial water release, but a full restoration of access for all Japanese seafood remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>British luxury and mass-market automakers are preparing to resume and increase shipments to the United States as a new trade deal reducing tariffs takes effect. The deal is a relief for companies like Aston Martin and JLR, which had paused or reduced exports due to a temporary 27.5% tariff. However, the agreement has drawn criticism from the UK's farming sector, which argues that agricultural concessions, such as removing tariffs on U.S. ethanol, were made to secure the deal for the auto industry. The deal also leaves steep tariffs on UK steel unresolved, creating ongoing uncertainty for that sector.</p>
