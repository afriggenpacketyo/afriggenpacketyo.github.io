          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from 2008, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic, resonating with a generation that saw it on TV during their formative years. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to combat the use of "that's so gay" as an insult. The PSA's impact is evident in data showing a decrease in the use of the phrase and a rise in Gay-Straight Alliance participation. The enduring legacy of the ad highlights the power of media messaging in advancing social issues, although it would be hard to replicate the ad's visibility today given the fragmented media landscape.</p>

          <p>The US has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, a drug hailed as a "miracle" due to its effectiveness and long-lasting protection. However, experts are worried that cuts to the health budget, both domestically and in global aid programs, will jeopardize the drug's potential to reduce HIV infections. These cuts may undermine efforts to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, as they affect key public health agencies and programs that are vital for getting lenacapavir to those who need it most. The concern is whether the promise of the drug could be undone by the defunding of US public health agencies.</p>

Quebec has one of the highest female labor force participation rates in the world and a smaller gender pay gap than the US.

          <p>The first evacuation flight from Israel landed in the UK, carrying 63 British nationals and their families after airspace was reopened following attacks. Passengers expressed gratitude but criticized the evacuation plan as "shambolic" and insufficient for the thousands stranded. One passenger recounted singing national anthems on the plane, reflecting a sense of unity. Passengers were greeted by support services upon arrival in Birmingham, while the Foreign Office said further flights would depend on demand and security.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's commitment to keeping inflation in check, despite criticism from President Trump. Powell said policymakers expect to stay on hold until they have a better handle on the impact tariffs will have on prices. He characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market to be around full employment, but noted that inflation is still above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's remarks suggest the Fed is prioritizing data analysis over political pressure in its monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two young bears escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K., devouring a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The park's keeping team successfully used recall training to encourage the bears back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error."</p>
