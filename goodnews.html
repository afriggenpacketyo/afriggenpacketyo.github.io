          <p>The United States has lifted export restrictions on chip-design software for China, allowing American companies like Synopsys and Cadence to resume business. The move reverses a policy implemented in May that required licenses for exporting such technology. This decision follows signals of a trade truce between the two nations and has positively impacted the stock prices of the affected companies, which dominate the global electronic design automation market. The policy shift is a significant development in the ongoing tech and trade relationship between the US and China.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, according to its foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan. This move is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign relations beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. The shift comes after dissatisfaction with Russia's role during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its aftermath. Mirzoyan's visit to Beijing signals a significant step in building new alliances as the South Caucasus nation navigates a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more prominent. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or a bill results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is lost. This procedural reality highlights the challenges for the majority party when dealing with internal defections, as even a small number of opposing votes can defeat legislation.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a significant increase from the previous year.

Ample market liquidity from mainland investors and concerns over potential U.S. delistings are also driving companies to seek fundraising in Hong Kong, positioning it to potentially become the world's top listing destination.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration executive order that suspended the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. In his ruling, Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an "alternative immigration system" that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that menopausal hormone therapy combining estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women under 55. Conversely, the study found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research provides a more nuanced understanding of hormone replacement therapy, distinguishing between different treatment types.
