          <p>Following intervention from the Department of Justice, Meta has removed a Facebook group that was allegedly used to dox and target U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Chicago. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the takedown, stating the DOJ will continue to press tech companies to remove platforms that incite violence against law enforcement. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group was removed for violating its policies against coordinated harm. This action follows similar moves by Apple and Google, which have also removed apps designed to report sightings of ICE agents, reflecting a broader effort by the administration to curb online activities perceived as endangering federal officers.</p>

          <p>Maggie Kang, co-director of the Netflix animated feature “KPop Demon Hunters,” has indicated potential for future stories within the film's universe but firmly stated they would remain in animation. In a recent interview, Kang and co-director Chris Appelhans explained that a live-action version would feel too grounded and lose the unique comedic and fantastical elements that define the characters. They believe the exaggerated abilities of the demon-hunting K-pop stars, such as performing a spinning back-kick while singing, are best suited for the animated medium. While no sequel is officially in development, the creators assured fans that any continuation would be a story that genuinely deserves to be told.</p>

          <p>Kevin Muscat, a former Rangers player and current manager of Chinese club Shanghai Port, is the leading candidate to become the new manager at the Scottish club, succeeding Russell Martin. Although discussions have reportedly taken place, the club maintains that talks with other candidates are ongoing and no deal has been finalized. If appointed, Muscat would likely not be available until the conclusion of the Chinese league season in late November, potentially requiring an interim manager. Muscat has a successful managerial record, having won league titles in Australia, Japan, and China, and is known for an aggressive, front-foot style of play that could appeal to the Ibrox fanbase.</p>

          <p>BlackRock's stock surged to a new record high following a third-quarter earnings report that surpassed expectations, validating its strategic expansion beyond traditional funds. The asset manager reported a 25% year-over-year revenue increase to $6.51 billion and record assets under management of $13.46 trillion. This growth is largely attributed to CEO Larry Fink's vision of positioning BlackRock as a comprehensive provider, with recent acquisitions in private credit and infrastructure assets paying off. The firm also saw its highest organic base fee growth in four years, driven by new client money in iShares ETFs, private markets, and cash management services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control every layer of its business, from custom chip development to consumer hardware, in a strategy resembling Apple's ecosystem model. A new partnership with Broadcom will co-develop custom AI accelerators, giving OpenAI deeper control over its infrastructure and an advantage in efficiency and performance. This follows massive deals with Nvidia and AMD and the acquisition of Jony Ive's design firm, signaling ambitions to own the AI experience from the silicon up. By building out its hardware, developer tools, and app distribution, OpenAI aims to create a tightly integrated platform, making its models not just powerful but also difficult for competitors to replace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a staggering $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The decision finalizes the record-breaking sum he was ordered to pay to the families of the victims, who testified that Jones' lies led to years of harassment and threats from his followers. Jones had argued that the Connecticut trial violated his free speech rights and that the judgment could never be paid. This ruling marks a significant legal conclusion in the long-running battle for accountability by the families of the Sandy Hook victims.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company is suing grocery chain Trader Joe's, alleging that its pre-made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are a direct copy of the iconic Uncrustables brand. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, claims trademark infringement based on the similar crustless, round, crimped design and packaging that prominently features the color blue. Smucker's argues that the Trader Joe's product is an "obvious attempt" to capitalize on the fame of Uncrustables and has caused consumer confusion. The company is seeking a court order to stop the sale of the product and is demanding that Trader Joe's surrender all profits gained from its sales.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, could conclude in the coming months. In a speech, Powell noted that the Fed is closely monitoring indicators that suggest liquidity conditions are tightening, signaling that the goal of achieving "ample" bank reserves is approaching. He provided no new guidance on the future direction of interest rates, reiterating that policymakers are navigating the tension between employment and inflation goals amid a softer labor market. Powell also defended the Fed's practice of paying interest on bank reserves as essential for controlling rates. (not investment advice)</p>
