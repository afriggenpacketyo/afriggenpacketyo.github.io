        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's proposed tax bill includes a provision for "Trump accounts," which are similar to 529 college savings plans and come with tax incentives. For children born between 2024 and 2028, the federal government will deposit $1,000 into these accounts as part of a "newborn pilot program." To be eligible, the child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. While supporters claim these accounts will promote wealth-building, some experts criticize them as overly complicated compared to universal savings accounts. The article is a straightforward explanation of the tax proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a larger tax cut package, mirroring a similar provision passed by the House. Both versions offer a deduction on qualified tips, but the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000. The House bill, in contrast, has no cap and completely eliminates the deduction for individuals earning over $160,000. Tax experts note that the tax break would only benefit a small percentage of workers. The article provides a detailed comparison of the two proposals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, streaming has surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV, representing 44.8% of total TV viewership in May, according to Nielsen. This milestone is attributed to the rise of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels, the growth of YouTube, and the shift of traditional media companies towards streaming. YouTube now represents 12.5% of all television viewing, while platforms like Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock have shifted to complement linear TV. Netflix remains the leading subscription provider.
