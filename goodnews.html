          <p>Despite the imposition of ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs by the United States, China's exports experienced an 8.1% increase in April, surpassing market expectations. While exports to the United States saw a 21% decline, this was offset by growth in other markets. China's imports also contracted by 0.2%, and the trade surplus decreased to $96.18 billion. The article illustrates China's ability to adapt to trade pressures through diversification and internal economic adjustments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a mines developer, industries in developed nations, including the defense sector, are recognizing the importance of diversifying their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on the metal. China's restrictions, implemented in February, have caused panic in the industry, which has relied on Chinese raw materials for three decades. The United States defense contractors must cease using Chinese tungsten by 2027. China accounts for a significant percentage of global raw tungsten ore production, highlighting the need for alternative sources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners from South Africa, who are descendants of Dutch colonizers, and they are expected to arrive in the U.S. This marks the first group accepted under President Trump's executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination. The decision has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that Afrikaners are among the most economically privileged in South Africa. The new arrivals will have a pathway to U.S. citizenship and be eligible for government benefits.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to a trade deal that maintains tariffs on most UK goods while rolling back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In return, the US expects to expand sales of agricultural products in the UK. Analysts suggest the substantive benefits will be limited, despite the agreement being touted as a breakthrough. While some sectors in the UK express relief, the deal leaves UK goods facing higher tariffs than before.</p>
