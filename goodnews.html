        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Clayton Kershaw's recent 3,000-strikeout milestone solidifies his claim as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's exceptional longevity and consistent high-level performance over 18 seasons, which contrasts with Koufax's brilliant but significantly shorter career. While acknowledging Kershaw's past postseason difficulties, the analysis prioritizes his vast body of work and sustained excellence as the ultimate measure of his legacy.</p>

Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to its rules, any question or legislative measure that results in a tie is automatically defeated, a critical factor as leadership navigates internal party dissent on major bills.</p>

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss concluded that the president had overstepped his legal authority, writing that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" to override laws enacted by Congress. The judge has temporarily stayed his order for 14 days to give the administration an opportunity to appeal.</p>

          <p>A recent Pew Research Center study showing that Donald Trump won 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election has prompted analysis from political experts. They theorize that the significant shift is less about a move toward traditional conservatism and more about a rise in populist sentiment. Key factors cited include economic concerns and a deep disillusionment with the Democratic Party's messaging and policies on immigration, which may have pushed many voters, especially naturalized citizens, to support Trump.</p>
