          <p>Driven by a burgeoning domestic coffee culture and a zero-tariff policy, China is significantly increasing its coffee imports from African nations. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are investing heavily in the region, signing deals in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to secure supply chains and build local processing facilities. This strategic move aims to meet the soaring demand within China and leverage global trade uncertainties, establishing a stronger economic foothold in Africa's coffee market. The effort reflects a broader strategy to diversify and lock in essential commodity supplies.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates heightened trade tensions with the United States, particularly concerning its trade relations with Russia. While noting that global trade challenges and geopolitical uncertainties persist, the RBI expressed confidence in the country's resilient domestic growth. The central bank maintained its GDP growth forecast at 6.5% for the fiscal year and lowered its inflation projection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan forward David Martínez was the star performer, scoring two goals to lead Los Angeles FC to a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty in the first half and, after Tigres equalized, secured the win with a skillful individual goal in the second half. The result places Tigres on the verge of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the win, LAFC's chances of advancing to the next round also remain slim.</p>

His comeback is seen as a crucial boost for the team, which had been counting on the return of injured players to reinvigorate its lineup.

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Indiana Fever 100-91, continuing their recent strong performance by winning their seventh game in eight outings. The Sparks capitalized on the absence of Fever's star player, Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury. Kelsey Plum led the Sparks with 25 points and 11 assists, supported by strong scoring from Rickea Jackson, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens. The game was briefly interrupted when a sex toy was thrown onto the court, the third such incident in the WNBA in recent weeks, though players and officials quickly moved past it.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire several NFL media properties, including the NFL Network and NFL Fantasy. The deal would also grant ESPN distribution rights for the RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL is set to receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a move that would transform the league from a media licensee into a significant platform partner. The agreement, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, is expected to enhance ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer service by adding valuable NFL content and programming.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026, citing a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The medium-security facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The state plans to support the local community and the 1,200 affected employees through an economic resiliency plan. The site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, will be maintained for potential reuse or sale.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its next five-year plan, economists are debating whether to include specific, measurable targets for consumption to help rebalance the economy away from its reliance on investment. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark, such as the household consumption rate as a share of GDP, would provide a clear policy goal to boost domestic demand and improve living standards. However, other influential thinkers are hesitant, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as policy goals and suggesting they may not be the most effective way to stimulate spending.

          <p>Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who had an underwhelming start to his season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury, is showing encouraging signs of a comeback. The Japanese phenom has been progressing in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and a new two-seam pitch being added to his arsenal. The Dodgers are hopeful that a healthy Sasaki could rejoin the active roster by late August and potentially contribute to their postseason push, either as a starter or a hard-throwing reliever. His return would provide valuable pitching depth for the team's World Series defense.</p>

Many of these accounts were linked to criminal centers in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to target individuals with fraudulent schemes, such as fake investment opportunities. The company is also rolling out new security features to alert users of suspicious activity, like being added to a group chat by an unknown contact. This initiative aims to disrupt scammers before they can operationalize their fraudulent campaigns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that redirecting the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the program for projects to mitigate natural disasters like floods. The administration had previously called the program wasteful but later stated it was still evaluating its future.</p>
