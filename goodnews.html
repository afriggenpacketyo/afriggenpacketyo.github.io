          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters soared after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter results that significantly beat Wall Street estimates. The company credited its success to recent marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce, which it said drove customer acquisition and positive traffic. Despite some controversy surrounding the Sweeney campaign, it led to sellouts of key denim products. The strong performance prompted American Eagle to reissue its full-year guidance, now expecting comparable sales to be approximately flat, an improvement over previous expectations.

CEO Tony Spring stated that the consumer remains resilient and that the company is well-positioned to navigate economic headwinds, including tariffs.

          <p>As gold prices surged to an all-time high of nearly $3,550 per ounce, an analysis shows that a one-ounce gold bar purchased from Costco a year ago for around $2,679 has seen a significant unrealized gain. The article explains that investors often turn to gold during economic uncertainty, a trend currently fueled by inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions. However, anyone looking to sell should expect to receive 5% to 10% below the spot price from dealers and must pay taxes on the profit. The IRS classifies physical gold as a collectible, which is taxed at a higher rate than stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in Morocco have uncovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, an ankylosaur from over 165 million years ago, revealing a creature with extraordinary body armor. The dinosaur, roughly the size of a small car, possessed three-foot-long spikes on its neck, large spikes over its hips, and ribs fused with outward-projecting spikes, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. Scientists believe this elaborate armor was likely used for both defense against predators and for attracting mates. The discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting their defensive and display structures were more complex and developed earlier than previously thought.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a Long Island judge has ruled that prosecutors can use advanced whole genome sequencing as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This marks the first time such cutting-edge DNA testing, which can analyze degraded and rootless hair samples, will be admissible in a New York State court, setting a major legal precedent. Prosecutors used the technology to link Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on several victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, with a decision on that challenge expected later.</p>

          <p>Reform UK national leader Nigel Farage has stated he will speak with a local party council leader in Nottinghamshire regarding a decision to ban contact with a local newspaper. The council leader, Mick Barton, had barred the Nottingham Post from speaking with him and other councillors following a disagreement over a story. The ban drew criticism for impeding press freedom and the role of local journalism in holding elected officials accountable. Farage, positioning himself as a "peacemaker," indicated he would discuss the matter with Barton at the upcoming party conference to find a solution to the dispute.</p>

The effort is part of a broader plan to improve transit between these hubs, especially with Disney's planned expansion and the development of the OC Vibe entertainment district. A study commissioned by the city from a gondola company pitched several concepts, including towers designed to resemble the ballpark's iconic "Big A" landmark. This proposal follows a similar, though more advanced, plan to build a gondola to serve Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.4 billion, the fifth-largest in the game's history, after no winner emerged from the latest drawing. The odds of winning the grand prize are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. A data analysis shows that a winner's take-home amount varies significantly by state due to differing tax laws. States like Florida and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to keep more of the prize, while states like New York have the highest tax rates, resulting in the lowest after-tax payout. The article also details the most and least frequently drawn numbers in recent drawings.</p>

His remains were recovered from the wreckage in 1957 but could not be identified at the time and were interred in Belgium. Using modern DNA analysis and other methods, scientists finally confirmed his identity, allowing him to be returned to his hometown for burial and providing closure for his family.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion," rejecting the administration's argument that mass illegal migration constitutes such an event. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of this specific wartime statute for the migrants who brought the lawsuit. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy and was hailed as a win by civil liberties advocates.</p>

The report's release coincides with the U.S. Congress finalizing its annual defense bill, which includes measures aimed at countering China. The recommendation for de-escalation challenges the prevailing narrative among some U.S. defense officials who point to a 2027 deadline for Chinese military readiness.</p>
