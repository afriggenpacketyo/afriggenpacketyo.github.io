          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza in Herriman, Utah, rupturing a gas line and causing a powerful explosion that destroyed the restaurant. The incident occurred following a three-vehicle accident, and two bystanders heroically rescued the SUV's occupants just minutes before the vehicle was engulfed in flames. While multiple people from the initial crash were hospitalized, no one was inside the building during the explosion, and no firefighters were injured. The blast also caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, including a Jimmy John's and a Supercuts.</p>

          <p>Crews are making significant progress fighting the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Containment has increased to 30% thanks to improved weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 firefighting personnel. The fire, which began on Wednesday, has threatened around 50 structures and prompted evacuation orders for over 200 people. A primary concern is the fire's threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species, as officials hope to make more headway before a predicted midweek heatwave.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers Clayton Kershaw and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been named to the National League All-Star Game roster. This marks Kershaw's 11th selection, chosen by Commissioner Rob Manfred as a “Legend Pick,” honoring his career milestone of 3,000 strikeouts. Yamamoto earned his spot by leading the team in multiple categories, including wins and ERA. They will join teammates Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Shohei Ohtani, who were previously selected as starters for the midsummer classic. The team also anticipates the return of injured pitcher Tyler Glasnow to the rotation soon.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time off work to grieve without fear of losing their job. The proposed extension will guarantee at least one week of leave, with the exact duration under consultation, acknowledging the significant emotional impact of early-stage pregnancy loss on both parents.</p>

This initiative is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at improving educational standards and narrowing the achievement gap among preschool children. The plan seeks to attract and retain qualified staff in 20 targeted areas where specialist teachers are scarce. The strategy also includes proposals for more frequent Ofsted inspections of nurseries to ensure quality and safety standards are met across the board.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham, creator of the New York-centric series "Girls," has set her new Netflix rom-com, "Too Much," in London, reflecting her own move to the city. The show follows an American, played by Megan Stalter, who falls for a punk musician. Dunham explains that she chose not to star in the series partly to avoid the intense public scrutiny of her body she experienced in her 20s. She reflects on society's persistent fatphobia and misogyny but notes she has developed a healthier relationship with her body, while also acknowledging past controversies and the lessons she has learned about taking space for herself.</p>

          <p>In Wyoming, a group of ranchers continues the Green River Drift, the longest-running cattle drive in the United States, a tradition dating back 125 years. Each spring, they drive thousands of cattle along a 70-mile route to graze in the high pastures of the Bridger-Teton National Forest. This practice originated from a crisis in the late 1800s when a harsh winter devastated herds, forcing ranchers to move their cattle to allow for hay cultivation in the valley. Despite modern challenges like predators and changing land use, these families remain dedicated to preserving their way of life and this iconic piece of American history.</p>
