The display includes the original 1937 English version, the first U.S. edition, and the earliest Chinese translation from 1938. Snow's book was based on his time embedded with the Red Army in 1936, where he conducted extensive interviews with key figures like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, several New Orleans residents are sharing their stories of survival, loss, and resilience. The article recounts the experiences of a mother who lost everything but found a new start, a surgeon who worked tirelessly to save patients in a flooded hospital, and the former police chief who dealt with the city's collapse. Despite the immense trauma and challenges, their reflections highlight a sense of hope and strength gained from surviving the catastrophic event. The hurricane resulted in nearly 1,400 deaths and displaced over a million people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago, New Orleans's public school system underwent a dramatic overhaul that included the termination of over 4,000 teachers, most of whom were experienced Black women. This shift to a charter school system led to a significant and lasting decline in the percentage of Black educators, from 71% pre-Katrina to a low of 49% by 2014. Now, Black-led organizations like Black Education for New Orleans (Be Nola) are working to reverse this trend through professional development and fellowship programs. These initiatives aim to restore a vital sense of community and provide positive role models for the city's majority-Black student population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, author Virginia Sole-Smith addresses the increasing cultural anxiety surrounding children's diets, particularly in light of movements like "Make American Healthy Again." Sole-Smith advocates for an anti-diet approach, arguing that restricting food can be harmful and that pathologizing body size creates toxic relationships with food. She suggests that instead of focusing on eliminating processed foods or obsessing over weight, the focus should be on ensuring all children have access to enough food and are empowered with bodily autonomy. The real issues, she contends, are systemic problems like poverty and food insecurity, not individual food choices.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has finalized the signing of 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club-record fee of up to £69 million. The deal, which secures the player on a six-year contract, surpasses the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer. Woltemade, who stands at 6ft 6in, is noted for his technical skill and had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals in 33 games. The signing is a significant move for Newcastle as they strengthen their attacking options amid uncertainty over Isak's future at the club.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its security and military cooperation with Somalia as part of its Global Security Initiative (GSI), aiming to help the nation build a self-reliant defense force to combat the extremist group al-Shabab. Recent efforts include a military scholarship program for Somali army officers and law enforcement training for security officials in China. This engagement reflects Beijing's broader strategy to present an alternative security model in Africa, filling gaps as other international missions, like the African Union's, prepare to withdraw. The cooperation also aligns with China's strategic interests, such as anti-piracy operations to protect its fishing and shipping routes.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration effectively shut down the widely used climate.gov website and fired its production team, a group of former members is working to resurrect its content. Led by the site's former managing editor, the team is building a new non-profit organization with a website called climate.us. The goal is not only to restore public access to accessible climate science information but also to expand the mission to offer direct climate-related services. The volunteer-driven effort is currently seeking funding to carry on the legacy of the original site, which they argue the administration is wrongfully hiding from taxpayers.</p>

The trio beat the previous record of 162 days while also raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a steady and dramatic decline in fatal drug overdoses in the U.S., falling to their lowest level since March 2020. The figures indicate that deaths dropped to 77,648 in the 12-month period ending in March 2025, a decrease of roughly one-third from the peak in 2023. Despite this positive trend, President Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts credit the decline to improved healthcare access and disruptions in fentanyl supply chains.</p>

          <p>A recent ruling from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has dealt a legal blow to President Trump's trade policies. The court upheld a lower panel's judgment that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally alter America's tariff schedules without congressional approval. This decision challenges the legal foundation of some of the administration's key tariff actions, which have been a central component of its economic strategy. The ruling creates a significant legal challenge for the administration and is likely to set up a future confrontation on the matter at the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>
