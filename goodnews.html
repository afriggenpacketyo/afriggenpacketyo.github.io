        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, just ahead of early voting. Jeffries praised Mamdani's dedication to tackling the affordability crisis and his pledge to represent all city residents, regardless of their political alignment. This high-profile backing aligns Mamdani with key Democratic figures, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who previously endorsed him. The endorsement injects further dynamics into the race, as Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, has also secured significant support, including from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The political landscape suggests a highly contested general election, with Jeffries' support expected to become a focal point for Republican criticism.</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent commenced a new round of trade discussions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, potentially paving the way for a summit between Presidents Xi and Trump. This marks their fifth face-to-face meeting since the US escalated its trade war in April, with a temporary trade truce nearing its expiration next month. The talks are crucial for addressing the complex economic and trade relations between the world's two largest economies, as both sides seek to navigate contentious issues. The resumption of high-level dialogue offers a cautious but positive sign for managing ongoing trade tensions and exploring pathways toward a more stable economic relationship before further tariff increases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea is being interpreted by experts as a carefully calibrated move to achieve a "symbolic restart" for the strained bilateral relationship. While immediate major breakthroughs are not anticipated, the trip aims to foster trust and improve communication after a period of heightened tensions. Xi's previous visit in 2014 led to a free-trade agreement, but subsequent diplomatic exchanges revealed complexities, particularly regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This current engagement signifies a mutual desire to stabilize ties and explore avenues for cooperation, acknowledging the delicate balance of regional diplomacy.</p>

Verstappen, currently 40 points behind championship leader Piastri, led the session despite expressing dissatisfaction with his car's pace during race-simulation runs. Norris, who finished fourth fastest, conceded that McLaren was "a little bit behind" and required substantial work on their car's balance and single-lap performance. This article details the contrasting performances of the teams, with Red Bull demonstrating strong qualifying potential but concerns over race-day consistency, and McLaren facing an uphill battle to optimize their setup for the upcoming sessions.</p>

          <p>A Santa Cruz sea otter, potentially the renowned "841" or a related individual, has once again begun attacking surfers and commandeering their surfboards at the popular Steamer Lane. This resurgence of curious and bold behavior mirrors incidents from two years prior, though the current otter is untagged, leaving its precise identity unclear. Federal wildlife officials had previously attempted to capture 841, who subsequently gave birth and ceased her interactions with humans. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, designated as the lead response agency, has not yet issued a statement, while California authorities currently have no plans for intervention, leaving surfers to contend with the persistent otter.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, with the influence of President Trump's tariffs remaining subdued. This crucial economic data was released despite the ongoing government shutdown, as it is necessary for calculating the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment. Economists suggest that while tariffs contribute to rising prices, businesses are absorbing some costs, passing on up to 55% to consumers. The report presents a complex scenario for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, balancing persistent inflation with a notable slowdown in job growth, though a rate cut is still widely expected due to labor market concerns (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As clocks revert and winter nights lengthen, particularly in Scotland's northern isles where daylight can drop to under six hours, over a million people in the UK experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Symptoms include lowered mood, irritability, and difficulties concentrating. This article highlights various coping strategies, such as light therapy, engaging in creative and cultural activities, and establishing new "light routines." Professor Hester Parr notes the challenges faced by rural communities with limited support, leading to initiatives like Orkney's "Wintering Well" boxes, which provide therapeutic lamps and mental health guides. The article also emphasizes the importance of embracing winter, redesigning interior spaces with comforting light, and maximizing outdoor exposure.</p>

          <p>A group of UK MPs on the Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against reducing the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the forthcoming Budget. The committee argues that such a cut, reportedly considered to incentivize investment in stocks and shares, is unlikely to achieve its goal of fostering an investment culture. With the Chancellor facing an estimated £22bn budget shortfall, changes to ISAs were reportedly being mulled but met significant opposition from financial institutions and consumer advocates. This article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding fiscal policy, emphasizing concerns about the potential negative impact on savers and the broader economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Factors Influencing Choice Between Manual and Automatic Driving Lessons in UK</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift in UK driving preferences is underway, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatic vehicles last year. This trend is largely influenced by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, as electric vehicles are exclusively automatic. New drivers face a dilemma: learning manual offers greater vehicle versatility, but automatic tests are perceived as quicker, despite official statistics showing a lower pass rate. This article explores the challenges, including a shortage of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs, alongside the evolving social perceptions and accessibility benefits for individuals with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The counting process is set to commence for the Irish presidential election, where citizens voted to select the tenth president, succeeding the current head of state, Michael D Higgins. Ballot boxes will open at 09:00 local time on Saturday, with the final result anticipated later that evening at Dublin Castle. Early unofficial reports suggest voter turnout might struggle to surpass the record low of just under 40% recorded in the previous 2018 presidential election. The primary contenders are independent politician Catherine Connolly, backed by several left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, with a third candidate, Jim Gavin, having withdrawn too late for his name to be removed from the ballot.</p>

This article critically examines the necessity and efficacy of these supplements, highlighting that while magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, proving a deficiency is challenging. Dietitians advocate for prioritizing dietary sources such as seeds, nuts, and leafy greens, cautioning that supplements may not be beneficial for most healthy individuals. Potential risks, including diarrhea for healthy people and life-threatening hypermagnesemia for those with kidney disease, underscore the importance of professional advice before beginning supplementation.</p>
