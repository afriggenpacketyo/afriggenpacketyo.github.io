          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against dissolving the House of Representatives, preventing concurrent elections for both parliamentary chambers in July. This decision comes as opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda refrained from submitting a no-confidence motion, citing concerns about stalling progress on crucial political matters. The ruling bloc, led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party, lacks a lower house majority, meaning a successful no-confidence motion could trigger either the chamber's dissolution or the Cabinet's resignation. Seiji Maehara, an opposition leader, noted Noda's desire to avoid a political vacuum amidst U.S. tariff worries and escalating Middle East tensions.</p>

          <p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is one of several schools working to alleviate the shortage of air traffic controllers in the U.S. by offering an accelerated training program. The FAA is currently short over 3,000 certified controllers, leading to mandatory overtime for many. This program mirrors the FAA Academy and allows students to start background checks early, potentially skipping the academy altogether. Graduates are eager to begin their FAA careers, seeing the job as creative and problem-solving, and are not intimidated by the stresses or overtime.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth celebrations across the country face new challenges, including safety concerns, reduced state support, and decreased corporate funding. In Bend, Oregon, organizers initially canceled their annual festival due to safety concerns, but another group revived it on a smaller scale indoors. West Virginia state employees no longer receive Juneteenth as a paid holiday, prompting organizers to move their event to Friday. Despite these obstacles, many organizers, like those in Nashville, emphasize the importance of celebrating Juneteenth and preserving its historical significance.</p>

          <p>Japan's decision to make high school tuition virtually free, even for private institutions, is raising concerns among educators and policy experts about a potential exodus from public schools. Critics argue that this policy, while aimed at easing financial burdens, lacks adequate support for struggling public schools. The move could deepen inequalities and undermine the role of public schools as safety nets for students with diverse needs. Some analysts have observed a shift away from public high schools in areas where similar programs have already been implemented.</p>
