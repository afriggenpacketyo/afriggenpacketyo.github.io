          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, prevents the government from deporting or detaining Khalil, a green card holder, for foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. Farbiarz stated that deporting Khalil for his views would likely be unconstitutional and that Khalil's career and reputation were being irreparably harmed. The injunction provides the government an opportunity to appeal before going into effect.</p>

The shift has created uncertainty at universities, which rely on tuition fees from international students and value their contributions to campus diversity.
