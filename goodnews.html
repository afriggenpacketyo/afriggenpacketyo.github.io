          <p>US Vice President JD Vance has joined Bluesky, a social media platform styled as a progressive alternative to X (formerly Twitter), and has invited his followers to join him there. Vance cited Bluesky as a place for "common sense political discussion and analysis." His account was briefly suspended due to concerns about impersonation but was quickly reinstated. Vance's move comes amid criticism of X for allowing hate speech and misinformation, leading some users to seek alternative platforms. The move may signal a shift in political discourse towards platforms perceived as more balanced.</p>

          <p>Communities across the United States are commemorating Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the end of slavery, with a variety of celebrations. Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, falls annually on June 19, the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were officially freed. Celebrations range from parades and concerts to educational workshops and art shows. The holiday became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, marking a significant moment in acknowledging the country's history and the ongoing pursuit of equality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, specifically marking the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom. While President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, its implementation in Confederate territories was delayed until the Union Army's arrival in Texas. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution later abolished slavery nationwide. Celebrations of Juneteenth vary, often including parades, parties, concerts, and educational events, serving as a joyful anniversary of independence and a reminder of the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <p>Honda is recalling approximately 260,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal pivot pin. The pin may not have been properly staked during production, which could cause the brake pedal to move side to side, impairing the driver's ability to stop safely. The recall affects Acura TLX (2021-2025), Acura MDX (2023-2025), and Honda Pilot (2023-2025) models. Owners of affected vehicles will be contacted and instructed to take their vehicles to a dealer for brake pedal replacement if necessary, and those who have already repaired the brakes are eligible for reimbursement.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but was convicted on a charge of operating under the influence. The jury's decision was influenced by reasonable doubt, conflicting expert testimonies, and concerns about the lead investigator's conduct. Read still faces a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by O'Keefe's family, which carries a lighter burden of proof. This civil case could potentially find Read liable for monetary damages related to O'Keefe's death.</p>

          <p>The Office for Students (OfS) in England has issued guidance stating that students should be prepared to encounter shocking and offensive views at university, emphasizing that exposure to diverse perspectives is part of the educational process. This guidance comes as a new law designed to protect free speech on campuses is set to take effect in August. The OfS can sanction universities that fail to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential fines reaching millions of pounds. The guidelines aim to ensure that universities support and protect academics whose views may provoke protest from students.</p>

The Bank marginally lifted its expectations for the UK economy, but noted that underlying growth was "weak."

          <p>Elon Musk responded to the explosion of a SpaceX Starship rocket during testing with a humorous "Just a scratch" comment on X. The Starship, crucial to NASA's Artemis program, experienced a "major anomaly" and burst into flames during a static fire test. SpaceX stated that the area was cleared for safety and that they are working with local officials. Despite previous test failures, Musk remains optimistic, downplaying the shortcomings with humor.</p>

          <p>The Florida Panthers have cracked and dented the Stanley Cup during their championship celebrations. The bowl of the famous trophy is cracked and the bottom is dented, but the Hockey Hall of Fame plans to have it repaired by the celebration parade on Sunday. Damage to the 131-year-old silver chalice is not uncommon, as it has been mishandled by players, submerged in pools, and dropped during celebrations throughout its history. The team's spirit remains high despite the mishap.</p>
