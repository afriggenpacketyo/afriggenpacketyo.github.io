        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in railway management. The initial nationalized service from Woking to Surbiton commenced on schedule, though a bus replaced the train to London Waterloo due to engineering work. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," they stopped short of promising reduced fares, instead emphasizing improvements to services and infrastructure investment. Concerns have been voiced by unions regarding the potential outsourcing of security and cleaning staff to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives have challenged Labour to fulfill their commitments.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. This announcement intensifies the existing policy disagreements within the Labour party. Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating asylum seeker hotels. The two-child benefit cap, introduced in 2017, restricts most families from claiming benefits for third or subsequent children born after April 2017, impacting an estimated 1.5 million families.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling a strengthening of ties with the British monarchy amid tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. This move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's sovereignty and independence, distinguishing it from being a "51st state," as Trump has suggested. The King's visit is also intended to improve relations with Trump, who admires the British monarchy, and to align Canada more closely with Europe as it navigates its relationship with the U.S.</p>
