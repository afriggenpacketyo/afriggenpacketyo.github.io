          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 01:43:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a notable recovery in July, with year-on-year declines narrowing to 1.5%, following steeper drops in prior months. This improvement is largely credited to Beijing's proactive campaign against excessive price wars, which had negatively impacted corporate financial health. While the mining sector continued to struggle, manufacturing and utilities reported improved profitability. This trend indicates the initial success of government policies designed to stabilize consumer price levels and mitigate intense market competition, known colloquially as "neijuan."</p>

          <p>Britain's Jacob Fearnley achieved his first US Open main-draw victory, defeating veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a challenging four-set match. The 24-year-old Scot battled significant nerves, evidenced by numerous double faults in high-pressure moments, and even contended with a distracting heckler. Despite these hurdles, Fearnley showcased resilience, particularly in the fourth set, to secure the win. This triumph sets him up for a second-round encounter with German third seed Alexander Zverev, a player who has previously defeated him this year.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces a "ridiculous" and "controversial" decision regarding his six wildcard picks for the upcoming match against Europe, including the unprecedented possibility of selecting himself. Bradley, who narrowly missed automatic qualification and is a strong player, acknowledges the scrutiny his choice will face. With the announcement due soon, the selection process is complicated by the fact that no playing captain has existed since 1963. The ultimate goal is to reclaim the trophy, and Bradley is confident his decision will prioritize the team's best interests, regardless of public debate.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw showcased another masterful performance, pitching five innings of one-run ball to secure his fifth consecutive victory, contributing to the Dodgers' 6-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds. Despite a diminished fastball velocity and early struggles, the 37-year-old left-hander retired 14 consecutive batters using a strategic mix of pitches. His ability to adapt and rely on his slider, curveball, and splitter to keep the Reds off-balance was key. This victory helps the Dodgers maintain their lead in a tight National League West race, highlighting Kershaw's continued impact late in the season.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried by Princess Diana in 1991 at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) has been opened, revealing a collection of 1990s artifacts. Items selected by competition-winning children included a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a passport, a pocket TV, and British coins. Originally intended for unearthing in "hundreds of years," the capsule was retrieved to make way for a new children's cancer center. Although some items showed damage, they were largely intact, offering a nostalgic glimpse into the era and Diana's involvement with the hospital as its president.</p>

          <p>A new report from SAP Concur indicates a mixed trend in U.S. travel, with leisure travel declining this year while business travel remains stable. The U.S. emerged as the top destination for global business travelers in the first half of 2025, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly more than Germany or the UK. Inbound business travel to the U.S. increased by 1% year-on-year, contrasting with a slight drop in overall global business travel volume. This suggests that corporate interests continue to drive travel to the U.S. despite broader negative travel sentiments.</p>

          <p>China's Tiangong space station has achieved significant scientific milestones, with its container-free laboratory cabinet successfully conducting experiments on heat-resistant materials for fusion reactors and hypersonic vehicles. This advanced electrostatic levitation technique, similar to methods used on the ISS, allows samples to be heated to extreme temperatures without physical contamination. The findings will aid in designing better tungsten alloys and support fundamental research for nuclear and aerospace applications. This development underscores Tiangong's growing capabilities in space research, positioning it as a key player in the global scientific community.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday as investors assessed recent economic data, including China's narrowing industrial profit declines and the imposition of steep U.S. tariffs on India. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw marginal gains, boosted by Nikon Corporation's surge on potential acquisition news, while South Korea's Kospi declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 posted slight increases, with some economists noting a recent surge in the CSI 300 due to "irrational exuberance." Despite this, analysts suggest any market correction is likely to be shallow given improving liquidity and a dovish Fed outlook.</p>

North Carolina is expected to host the most expensive race, while Georgia, New Hampshire, Michigan, Maine, Texas, Ohio, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Iowa also feature competitive battles.

Authorities announced 48 criminal counts against nine key individuals, including alleged ringleader David Ahl, who is accused of directing theft crews to steal high-value items for resale. The operation, dubbed "Operation Kill Switch," led to 14 arrests and the seizure of millions in stolen property and illicit money.

The Super Heavy booster also performed as planned, returning to the Gulf for a controlled splashdown after a deliberate engine shutdown test.
