          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and used the opportunity to emphasize the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force. Pence highlighted his adherence to constitutional principles during the 2020 election aftermath, despite pressure from President Trump to overturn the results. He underscored the Constitution as the common ground that binds Americans, irrespective of their differences, and referenced disagreements with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were recognized as upholding the peaceful transfer of power, earning him the award.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has shut down its in-house beagle laboratory after reports surfaced detailing alleged inhumane treatment of thousands of beagles over four decades. Allegations included injecting pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and subjecting them to deadly experiments. The decision follows scrutiny from animal rights groups and investigations into the lab's practices, and comes after DOGE head Elon Musk posted on X that he would investigate funding beagle experiments. Animal rights organizations praised the closure as a step towards modernizing science and ending wasteful spending on animal abuse. PETA highlighted Anthony Fauci's alleged approval of funding for tests in Tunisia where beagle puppies were drugged, and their heads were locked in cages filled with hungry, infected sandflies.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3, ending their seven-game winning streak. May gave up two two-run home runs to Austin Riley on poorly executed sweepers, accounting for all four of the Braves' runs. Despite pitching effectively outside of those two pitches, May's inability to consistently land his sweeper has been a recurring issue in recent outings. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, failing to provide sufficient run support for May, who has yielded 14 runs in his last three starts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated that he will not seek a third term in office, acknowledging the constitutional limitations that prevent him from doing so. Despite some individuals wanting him to serve a third term, which is prohibited by a constitutional amendment passed in 1947, Trump stated that he intends to serve only two terms. He expressed his desire to have four great years and then pass the presidency on to a great Republican. This statement comes amid other news, including Trump's uncertainty regarding upholding constitutional due process, his consideration of military force to control Greenland, and proposed cuts to NPR and PBS funding.</p>

          <p>A recent trend shows voters punishing candidates seen as friendly to President Trump, but Trump's influence on global politics is complex. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties won elections by campaigning against Trump-like policies, while in Germany, Trump's actions have indirectly helped the new chancellor. However, in Britain, a Trump ally is gaining ground, and the Labour Party has suffered losses. The article also highlights the impact of Trump's policies on international trade and alliances, suggesting that his presence is a significant factor in voters' decisions worldwide.</p>

          <p>As more women are turning to egg freezing to delay childbearing, experts caution against relying on it as a guaranteed solution. Egg freezing is expensive and has no guarantees. Some experts say that it sends the wrong message because of the risks involved and how costly it can be. A better solution, she argues, would be to have policies like paid parental leave, flexible hours, child care at the workplace, to make it easier for women to have babies younger.</p>
