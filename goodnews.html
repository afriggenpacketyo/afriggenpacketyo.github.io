          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 08:38:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street forecasts, although they were lower than the previous year because of declining crude oil prices attributed to worries about President Trump's tariffs impacting global demand. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, together with cost-cutting initiatives, primarily offset the negative effects of low oil prices. The oil major's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana regions, and cost efficiencies. The company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reflecting its commitment to shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FTSE 100 index in London is on track for record-breaking gains, bolstered by the UK's perceived safety from U.S. tariff policies. The index has seen fourteen consecutive sessions of gains, driven by defensive stocks like healthcare, energy, and consumer staples, which are attracting investors seeking refuge from volatility. Analysts suggest that the FTSE 100's upward momentum could persist if defensive stocks remain popular, supported by a high dividend yield and a resilient UK economy. However, potential risks include geopolitical hotspots, revived tariff tensions, and a stronger pound, which could pressure export-heavy members of the index.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry indicated that it is "evaluating" an offer from the U.S. to engage in talks regarding tariffs, potentially de-escalating the ongoing trade war. Despite being open to negotiations, the ministry cautioned that it would not be coerced into accepting an unfavorable agreement. This shift in tone contrasts with previous statements accusing the U.S. of using tariffs as a bullying tactic. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that China is interested in reaching a trade deal with the U.S.</p>
