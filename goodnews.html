          <p>The Princess of Wales has withdrawn from her planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. Royal sources indicate she is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public engagements, expressing disappointment in missing the event. Other members of the royal family, including King Charles, Queen Camilla, and Prince William, attended the event, with Prince William handing out race prizes, while Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, was also present. The Princess was last seen at the Order of the Garter service, and her recent public appearances have been increasing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new Zillow report, selecting the right interior paint colors can increase a home's sale price by nearly $2,600. Olive green is the most desirable kitchen color, potentially adding up to $1,600 in value, while classic navy walls in the bedroom can increase the price by an estimated $1,815. Dark gray living rooms are also favored by buyers, while bright, playful colors may deter them, so sellers should consider neutral and sophisticated tones to maximize buyer interest. The report emphasizes the importance of aesthetic considerations in attracting buyers and increasing a home's market value.</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK have surpassed 29C, signaling the approach of the first heatwave of the year, with potential peaks of 33C expected on Friday and Saturday. Yellow heat-health alerts are in place for most of England, indicating increased risks for vulnerable individuals, and temperatures are expected to rise further, with the possibility of a "tropical night" where temperatures do not drop below 20C. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where parts of France and Spain could see temperatures close to 40C. A Met Office study indicates a rapidly increasing risk of 40C temperatures in the UK due to climate change.</p>

The jury found Read guilty on only one charge: operating a vehicle under the influence, with the judge sentencing her to one year of probation.

          <p>The time it takes to eliminate credit card debt depends on the strategy used, with minimum payments potentially taking over 30 years to pay off $8,000 at 22% APR, costing nearly $40,000 in interest. Increasing monthly payments to $250 would reduce the payoff time to just over four years, with approximately $4,100 in interest paid. Debt relief options like debt consolidation, balance transfers, and debt management plans can expedite the process and save on interest, while bankruptcy offers a quick way to eliminate debt but carries long-term consequences.

Mamdani's rise is fueled by dissatisfaction with the status quo and a desire for change, but his ability to translate his vision into practical governance remains uncertain.
