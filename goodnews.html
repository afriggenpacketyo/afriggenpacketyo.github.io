          <p>A trio of U.S.-based astronomers searching for the hypothetical "Planet Nine" have discovered a new dwarf planet, 2017 OF201, in the outer solar system. The object is roughly 430 miles across and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years. Its orbit does not follow the clustered trend of similar objects, potentially weakening the argument for Planet Nine's existence, although more data is needed. The discovery highlights the potential for groundbreaking discoveries through open science and archival data, demonstrating that significant findings aren't limited to those with access to the largest telescopes.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions. Ortberg dismissed the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, noting that Boeing pays tariffs on imported components for its Dreamliner planes but can recoup much of it when the planes are exported again. He said that China has indicated they will take deliveries, with the first deliveries occurring next month. This resumption is a positive sign for Boeing, a top U.S. exporter that benefits from increased production and trade relations.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining current rates, savers can maximize returns with certificates of deposit (CDs), but timing is crucial. Short-term CDs currently offer the highest interest rates, making them attractive for those seeking optimal yields and earlier maturity dates. Long-term CDs provide certainty for longer periods, but may not be as advantageous in the current environment. Experts recommend a CD ladder strategy to lock in above-average yields across various terms, adapting to the inverted yield curve where shorter terms offer better rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The court's ruling affirmed Congress's power over tariffs, with states acting as a check on unlawful exercises of federal power. The piece suggests that Congress should set tariff policy and impeach any president who usurps its authority.</p>
