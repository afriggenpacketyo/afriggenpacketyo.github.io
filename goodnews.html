          <h2>UK Government Defends National Insurance Exemption in Trade Deal with India Amid Opposition Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 05:37:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, specifically an exemption on National Insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders, against claims that it could disadvantage British workers. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds argues that the deal, which extends the exemption from one to three years, aligns with existing agreements and will not undercut British labor. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India by making it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars, and cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK. The Scotch Whisky Association anticipates a significant increase in Scotch exports, potentially creating 1,200 jobs across the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German football is experiencing a decline in participation among teenage boys, prompting the German FA (DFB) to initiate reforms aimed at retaining young players. The number of men's U19 and U17 teams in Germany has decreased significantly since 2006, raising concerns about the future of football in the country. The DFB is focusing on making football more enjoyable and less results-oriented for young players, encouraging creativity and participation over strict competition. Similar trends have been observed in England, where a drop in participation among 16-24 year olds has led to the introduction of new strategies to combat the decline.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a nearly 7% increase after the company announced it anticipates improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of the year, driven by the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter net profits that exceeded expectations, although Wegovy sales slightly missed forecasts due to competition from alternative versions in the U.S. market. CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen anticipates that the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA will allow sales to rebound and that the company will pursue companies unlawfully distributing copycat drugs.</p>

The production will run for eight weeks at London's Bridge Theatre from September 10, and will also star Andrew Lincoln.

          <p>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has announced a partnership with Taiwan's Foxconn to outsource the production of its electric vehicles (EVs), with plans to launch them in Australia and New Zealand in the second half of next year. The agreement with Foxtron Vehicle Technologies Co. marks a significant move for the Japanese auto industry, which has historically been hesitant to outsource manufacturing to companies outside the traditional automotive sector. Separately, Mitsubishi Motors will launch new EVs supplied by Nissan Motor Co., targeting the North American market in the latter half of 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the change as a "bold action to improve train services and unlock thousands of jobs". Union Aslef supports the move, stating that it would open up opportunities for school or college leavers, while the Rail Safety and Standards Board asserts that research found "18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers".</p>

          <h2>American Investment in Soccer Faces Potential Conflict with European Expansion</h2>

          <p>American investment in European soccer clubs has been successful, but it now faces a potential challenge as European leagues seek to expand into the American market, creating a possible conflict of interest. With the settlement of a lawsuit that blocked cross-border domestic competition, leagues like the Premier League and La Liga are now free to stage games in the United States, potentially undermining the domestic game. The FIFA working group is attempting to curb this border-hopping, but this may be difficult to do as these leagues are focused on monetization.</p>

          <p>A new bill to be introduced in Parliament in England and Wales proposes that criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison. This measure aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice and to provide some solace to victims' families. The bill could also apply to offenders who disrupt proceedings and are removed from court, and those already facing whole life orders could be confined to their cells and stripped of privileges.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of monetary policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, in response to the ongoing trade war with the United States. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced 10 measures aimed at stabilizing markets and supporting economic growth, including removing restrictions on auto financing firms and freeing up funds for government priorities like technological innovation. The announcement comes as officials from China and the Trump administration prepare to hold their first formal trade talks since the imposition of tariffs.</p>
