          <h2>Former MLB Executive Criticizes Royals' Decision to Call Up Top Prospect Jac Caglianone</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Miami Marlins team president David Samson has criticized the Kansas City Royals for calling up their top prospect, Jac Caglianone, citing concerns about service time and arbitration eligibility. Samson argues that the Royals should have waited to call up Caglianone to avoid him reaching arbitration a year earlier, which could cost the team millions of dollars. He believes that bringing Caglianone up now puts added pressure on him to perform immediately. Caglianone had a strong performance in the minors with a .322/.389/.593 slash line, but went 0-for-5 in his major league debut.</p>
