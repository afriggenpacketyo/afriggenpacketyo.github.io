          <p>Index funds have long dominated the market, but active management is making a comeback as investors are increasingly engaging in active trading, particularly within exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Data indicates a net outflow from equity ETFs overall, but active equity ETFs saw inflows, suggesting a transformation in the ETF space. Experts note a record number of ETFs launching, with active ETFs rivaling index ETFs in number, and investors are allocating more capital to actively managed funds. Investors are advised to identify funds with unique approaches and consider factors like R-squared to gauge a fund's active nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A town in Texas, near the Mexican border and home to Elon Musk's SpaceX facility, has been officially renamed Starbase after a vote by its residents. The decision to incorporate as a city separates Starbase from Cameron County, which previously opposed additional housing construction for SpaceX employees. This new status grants Starbase greater control over building permits and local laws. However, some critics have voiced concerns about the potential environmental impact of the development.</p>
