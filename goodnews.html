          <h2>FDA Reverses Course, Allowing Juul to Continue Selling Tobacco and Menthol E-Cigarettes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:09:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market, rescinding a 2022 ban. The agency concluded that the company's products could benefit adult smokers by offering a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes. This decision, which makes Juul one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol vapes, has drawn sharp criticism from anti-tobacco groups who blame the brand for fueling the teen vaping crisis. The authorization is not an endorsement, and the FDA maintains that non-smokers should not use any e-cigarette products.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the liquid size restrictions could be the next policy to change, following the recent elimination of the shoe removal requirement. The current "3-1-1" rule was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot involving liquid explosives. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanning technology at airport checkpoints that can better detect threats.</p>

          <p>For one night, partisan divisions were set aside as female members of Congress from both parties played together on "Team Congress" in their annual softball game. The event, which pits the lawmakers against a team of female journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million since its inception in 2009. The event highlights a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill, with participants emphasizing the importance of coming together for a common good.</p>

          <p>A cylinder of ice, potentially over 1.5 million years old and drilled from deep within Antarctica, has arrived in the UK for analysis. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the core to study ancient dust, ash, and trapped gases, which hold vital clues about Earth's past climate. This research aims to provide new insights into a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when the planet's glacial cycles changed dramatically. The data could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June as Rice Prices Cool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in the rapid increase of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the cooling, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, fueling arguments for a potential interest rate hike. However, concerns over economic growth, exacerbated by potential U.S. tariffs, may lead the central bank to delay any policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK to Impose Stricter Affordability Checks on 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:14:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK regulations set to take effect next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and will bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit. As a result, some consumers may be denied BNPL credit, but the rules will also grant users rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information. Consumer advocates have praised the changes, citing the growing number of people facing financial hardship from these services.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting blood flow in the legs. The disclosure came after days of public speculation fueled by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swelling in his legs. A letter from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common," especially in people over 70, and stated that Trump is otherwise in "excellent health." The physician attributed the hand bruising to tissue damage from frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use for cardio-vascular prevention.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving," avoiding jail time for his 2024 DUI citation. The former USC star was arrested after being found asleep behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed. Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation, a fine, and must complete two online courses, allowing him to put the incident behind him and focus on his career, though he may still face a suspension from the NFL.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions package targets Russia's energy and banking sectors, including measures against the Nord Stream pipelines and cutting more Russian banks from the SWIFT system.</p>
