          <p>President Donald Trump reversed his decision to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, a move that had ignited widespread condemnation from California leaders and significant public protests. The proposed deployment of over 100 federal agents to an Alameda Coast Guard base was called off after discussions between Trump, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, and prominent Silicon Valley executives. While the immediate threat of a federal surge in San Francisco was averted, local officials and community organizers remain highly vigilant, preparing rapid response networks and legal aid, as uncertainties persist regarding potential federal operations in other Bay Area cities and the broader scope of enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly advised Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff of California on mortgage fraud charges. This development comes after President Trump publicly urged the criminal prosecution of Schiff, a prominent critic and lead prosecutor during Trump's first impeachment. Despite the prosecutor's assessment, a senior Justice Department official, Ed Martin, is reportedly advocating for the continuation of the investigation. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, denounced the probe as a politically motivated and baseless attempt to intimidate and silence a political opponent.</p>

The Solana Foundation, for instance, is actively investing in China's developer ecosystem, recognizing the immense potential in decentralized payments across Chinese-speaking regions.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court unanimously rejected the Trump administration's bid to postpone court rulings on veterans' disability benefits, which would have effectively paused nearly all cases until the government shutdown concluded. The court, with a Trump-appointed chief judge, deemed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' request "significant and extreme," lacking adequate justification. Veterans advocacy groups strongly criticized the administration, asserting it was using the shutdown as a pretext to deny timely benefits to veterans, some of whom have waited decades for compensation related to toxic exposure. This ruling represents a notable judicial check on administrative actions during the government impasse.</p>
