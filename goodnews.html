          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones due to concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light. Some projects have been canceled due to local opposition, highlighting the tensions between tech companies' need for data storage and processing facilities and residents' quality of life. Municipalities are beginning to implement regulations to address these concerns, such as requiring early construction announcements and clearly indicating the location of heat-emitting units. Industry groups are working to improve relations between locals and data center operators to build trust and mitigate anxiety.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese plans to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss increasing the number of nuclear-powered submarines operated by Australia, Britain, and the United States, arguing it will enhance Indo-Pacific security. Albanese will emphasize Australia's financial support for U.S. submarine construction under AUKUS, as well as the access the U.S. submarine fleet will gain to maintenance yards in Australia. He also intends to address Trump's tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum, which Australia views as economically harmful. An annual poll indicates declining public sentiment in Australia towards the United States, though support for AUKUS remains strong.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, increasing by 6.4% year-on-year in May, surpassing analysts' estimates. The growth was partly attributed to the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8% year-on-year, and fixed-asset investment also saw a deceleration. The urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, marking the lowest level since November of the previous year.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, surged over 15% following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group.

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the potential transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges.

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites. Gambling with overseas-based betting sites is a crime in Japan, prompting the government to address the issue by urging operators to cut off access to their sites, many of which are provided in Japanese. This move follows media revelations of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, and a police survey estimating that over 3 million people in the country have gambled online.

Researchers have successfully extended the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years at a brightness comparable to commercial displays, addressing a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. The team's PeLEDs reached a brightness of 1.16 million nits, surpassing the brightest commercial screens, and exhibited a theoretical lifespan of over 185,000 hours at 100 nits.
