Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will now be restricted to those under 21, shifting the financial burden to employers for older apprentices. This move aims to increase entry-level apprenticeships for younger adults, with the government promising to create 120,000 more training opportunities.
