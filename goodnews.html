          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, exceeding economists' predictions of 3.5% growth and accelerating from the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the strong performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook for the second half of 2025, citing significant global economic uncertainty, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. The government has already downgraded its full-year GDP forecast and is rolling out grants to help businesses manage the impacts of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by enhancing its defense and maritime cooperation with the Philippines while managing its significant trade relationship with China. As part of a broader civil maritime program, Australia recently donated equipment to the Philippines and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million by 2029. This strategic partnership is set to deepen as the two nations approach their 80th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2026. The move reflects a shared motivation to bolster regional security amidst increasing tensions and strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Students Increasingly Prioritize Technology-Focused University Majors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 20:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly favoring technology and engineering disciplines for their university studies. Fields like information technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices, reflecting a belief that these areas represent the future of industrial development. This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were popular, driven by China's entry into the WTO and its property boom. The current focus is heavily influenced by China's state-driven push to excel in technology amid intensified competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is celebrating a remarkable milestone: 230 years of uninterrupted, handwritten weather observations. This tradition makes it the longest continuous weather data sequence in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable record of climate history since July 14, 1795. Despite the prevalence of automated stations, a human observer continues to manually record daily readings, a practice maintained through generations. The records have chronicled major weather events, like the 'Night of the Big Wind' in 1839, and have contributed to the science of meteorology, including the development of the cup anemometer.</p>

Tactical adjustments, including moving Lauren James to the wing and starting Ella Toone, have proven effective. They now face a strong Swedish team on Thursday in a highly anticipated rematch of the Euro 2022 semi-final.</p>

          <p>King Charles has invited U.S. President Donald Trump for a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17-19. The visit is strategically scheduled while the House of Commons is in recess for party conferences, which averts the possibility of a controversial address to Parliament by the president. The trip, a rare second state visit for a U.S. leader, is seen as a diplomatic move by the UK government to maintain strong ties. The Trumps will be hosted at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations, though the full itinerary has not yet been released.</p>

Once involved in gang culture and addicted to methamphetamine, Vanderslice has been sober for over 13 years and now mentors young people by teaching them to build and paint lowrider bicycles. His personal car's paint job illustrates his journey "out of the darkness, into the light," a theme he now imparts to his community.
