          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison for wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Antle pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered species, including chimpanzees, lions, and tigers, for his Myrtle Beach zoo. Prosecutors stated he laundered over $500,000 to facilitate these black-market animal purchases. Despite his lawyers' request for probation, the judge imposed the prison sentence, a $55,000 fine, and the forfeiture of three chimpanzees, marking a significant legal outcome in the saga surrounding the popular series.</p>

          <p>Jewel Thais-Williams, the founder of Jewel’s Catch One, a pioneering nightclub that served as a sanctuary for L.A.'s Black queer community for over 40 years, has passed away at age 86. Opened in 1973, The Catch became a vital cultural hub, welcoming patrons shunned by other gay clubs and hosting legendary performers like Donna Summer and Chaka Khan. Beyond nightlife, Thais-Williams was a crucial activist during the AIDS crisis, co-founding the Minority AIDS Project and establishing housing for women with HIV. Her legacy is celebrated for creating generations of Black queer joy, safety, and community in Los Angeles.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 20:08:41 EDT</div>

          <p>With forecasters predicting an unusually active Atlantic hurricane season, homeowners on the East and Gulf Coasts are increasingly investing in climate-resilient construction. This article highlights homes, like a circular house in Florida, designed with aerodynamic shapes, deep anchors, and flood vents to withstand powerful storms up to Category 5 strength. Companies specializing in these designs report high success rates in past hurricanes. Experts from the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety reinforce the value of such proactive measures, including reinforced roofs and wind-rated garage doors, which can significantly reduce damage and lead to long-term financial savings.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held their second meeting in two days to discuss the war in Gaza and potential ceasefire terms. The meeting followed comments from U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, who indicated that Israel and Hamas are down to a single remaining issue in negotiations for a 60-day ceasefire deal. The proposed agreement would reportedly include the release of ten living hostages and the remains of nine deceased ones. While Trump expressed optimism about the talks, Qatari mediators have cautioned that more time is needed to reach a final agreement.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor projects that China will install at least 9 gigawatts this year, accounting for more than half of the global total. This surge is driven by strong government support, including financial subsidies and strategic planning, as Beijing seeks to advance its marine economy. President Xi Jinping has identified offshore wind as a key sector for creating jobs, ensuring energy security, and boosting the economies of coastal provinces.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss medication. In the ad for the brand Yazen, Collins claimed she had gone "two sizes down" thanks to its app and medication. The ASA ruled that although a specific drug was not named, the post breached rules against advertising prescription drugs directly to the public. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the regulator, which banned eight other similar advertisements from various companies for promoting weight-loss injections and treatments.</p>

Mahin, a veteran executive with two decades of experience, will have an annual salary of $375,000 and will oversee the county's reorganized approach to the homelessness crisis. The new department was created to provide more direct accountability over spending, which previously flowed through the much-criticized Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). Mahin currently directs the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new agency's focus on providing housing and care for people with complex needs.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's new forward, João Pedro, made a stunning first start for the club, scoring two brilliant goals in the Club World Cup semi-final against his former boyhood team, Fluminense. The Brazilian striker, who joined from Brighton for a reported £60 million, demonstrated his value with two distinct, powerful strikes that secured Chelsea's place in the final. His all-around performance, including his link-up play and movement across the pitch, has immediately staked his claim for a regular spot in the team. The impressive debut suggests he could be the answer to the club's recent search for a reliable and impactful center-forward.</p>

Cramer praised Carvana's convenient online sales model and its potential to gain market share in a fragmented industry. He also noted the company could benefit from potential interest rate cuts and new tariffs on foreign automakers, which make used cars more attractive, though he cautioned the stock may be approaching overbought territory.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the policy is effective immediately, attributing the change to dramatic evolution in security technology over the past two decades. The rule was first implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident. While some airports have already quietly rolled out the new procedure, it will be implemented nationwide, streamlining the travel experience while officials say a multi-layered security approach remains in place to ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific coast. The proposed 4,500-kilometer (2,800-mile) railway would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the port of Chancay, Peru, potentially reshaping South American trade routes to Asia. If constructed, the corridor could reduce shipping times by up to 12 days compared to routes using the Panama Canal. The agreement initiates a five-year study phase to assess the technical, environmental, and economic viability of the ambitious infrastructure project, which has an estimated cost exceeding $70 billion.</p>
