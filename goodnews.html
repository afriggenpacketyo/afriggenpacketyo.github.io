          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" during an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, who had previously suggested the possibility of the U.S. acquiring Canada. Carney emphasized partnership over acquisition, referencing real estate concepts to make his point to Trump. Despite tensions on trade and borders, Carney expressed a commitment to standing firm against the U.S. president and urged him to cease referring to Canada as the 51st state. Trade discussions are ongoing, with Carney cautioning against expecting immediate progress confirmations due to the complexity of the negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of 12% despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration, as analysts raised concerns about a decline in international revenue. CEO Alex Karp defended the company's performance, stating that Palantir is "pretty happy" and will continue to partner with the world's best people. While Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and increased its revenue guidance for the year, analysts attributed the stock's decline to the company's high software multiple and the potential for compression as revenue growth slows. Karp remains optimistic, highlighting the company's 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. as drivers of its success.</p>

Despite these assurances, DMV offices across the country extended hours to meet demand, with some individuals experiencing lengthy waits. REAL ID, a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card, was recommended by the 9/11 Commission to enhance security standards.</p>

          <p>California Democratic lawmakers have reached a deal on legislation concerning the solicitation of minors, increasing penalties for adults who solicit sex from individuals aged 16 or 17. The new amendments to AB 379 allow prosecutors to file felony charges against adults who are three years or more older than the minor, while those within three years face misdemeanor charges. The bill also includes a state grant program to support human and sex trafficking cases, along with a survivor support fund. The legislation is currently under consideration in the Assembly, marking a shift after initial opposition from Assembly Democrats.</p>

          <p>Sky News analyzes Mark Carney's body language during his meeting with President Trump, noting his firm stance against the annexation of Canada. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" and used real estate analogies to shut down the debate. However, when discussing tariffs, Carney struggled to interject, displaying visible frustration through clenched jaws and silent mouthing of "never, never." The analysis suggests that while the meeting was more cordial than expected, tensions remained evident in Carney's non-verbal cues.</p>
