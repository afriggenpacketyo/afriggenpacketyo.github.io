          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Representative Abe Hamadeh for reelection, highlighting Hamadeh's "America First" stance. Trump previously endorsed Hamadeh before the 2024 GOP primary and later issued a dual endorsement with another candidate, Blake Masters. Hamadeh introduced a resolution to limit the types of flags displayed in House facilities, allowing only the American flag, state flags, and flags of visiting foreign dignitaries. Hamadeh stated that Congress should embody the American people, explaining his resolution to ban foreign and ideological flags. Hamadeh has inspired many to serve the country, as he said in a letter to Trump on the president's 79th birthday. </p>

          <p>Despite numerous challenges and criticisms, California remains committed to its high-speed rail project. The project aims to alleviate traffic congestion, connect affordable housing areas, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The rail line's route through the Central Valley is intended to stimulate housing and commerce development. High-speed rail is considered more efficient than cars or planes and will become cleaner as the grid transitions to renewable energy sources. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Assisted stretching studios are proliferating in Los Angeles, offering deeper stretches than individuals can achieve alone, with practitioners called "flexologists." These therapists focus on stretching muscles and fascia to increase flexibility and mobility, but they do not diagnose or treat injuries. Assisted stretching can help increase range of motion, stimulate blood flow, and alleviate stress, but it is not a cure-all and could exacerbate existing injuries. Consistency is key to experiencing the benefits of stretching, which may help with stiffness, pain relief, and injury prevention. </p>

          <p>California is deliberately setting fire to large areas of wilderness to reduce the fuel available for catastrophic wildfires. Before European settlement, regular burning maintained a calmer landscape. The state aims to burn 400,000 acres annually, but federal agency cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may hinder this goal. State officials worry these cuts will reduce fire prevention efforts. The process requires extensive planning and cooperation to manage smoke and environmental impacts. </p>
