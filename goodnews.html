          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with events at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of two new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775, the agency is marking its semiquincentennial with a focus on its historical significance in unifying the nation. The celebration occurs as the USPS faces political discussions about its future, including potential privatization, though the new postmaster general has stated his opposition to such measures. The event aims to honor the enduring values of the Postal Service while looking toward its future.</p>

          <p>Walmart-owned Sam's Club in China, known for its curated selection of premium, imported goods, has caused a stir among its members by stocking a low-priced, domestically made chocolate pie. This move has offended the sensibilities of many middle-class shoppers who pay an annual fee for access to what they perceive as a high-quality, global lifestyle. For these consumers, the presence of a common, mass-market snack item has eroded trust and sparked concerns that the retailer's standards for quality are declining.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss transatlantic trade relations. The primary goal is to reach a framework agreement to prevent a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU imports from taking effect on August 1. There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could involve a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent U.S.-Japan agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Max Planck Institute have found evidence that the building blocks of life may form in space and are more common than previously believed. Researchers detected over a dozen complex organic molecules, including precursors to DNA and RNA, surrounding a protostar in the Orion constellation. This discovery challenges the assumption that such molecules would be destroyed during a star's violent formation, suggesting instead that the chemical seeds of life are assembled in interstellar clouds and can be inherited by newly forming planetary systems.</p>

          <p>This opinion column reflects on the death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner and the profound impact of his character, Theo Huxtable, on "The Cosby Show." The author argues that for many Black viewers in the 1980s, Theo provided a rare and crucial on-screen representation of a young Black man from a successful, supportive, two-parent family. This portrayal challenged the prevailing, often trauma-focused narratives in media and offered an affirming vision of Black life that resonated deeply with a generation.</p>

          <p>A growing number of African Americans are relocating to Kenya, drawn by the tropical climate, friendly culture, and a profound sense of historical and cultural connection. Many describe the move as "coming home," finding solace and a better quality of life away from the social and political tensions in the United States. While the current U.S. political environment is a factor, most say they had been considering a move for some time, with some establishing thriving businesses and communities in Nairobi.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC suffered a 1-0 defeat at home against the Portland Timbers, continuing a trend of dropping points at BMO Stadium.

The team's coach expressed disappointment and noted the need to be active in the transfer market to bring new energy to the squad.</p>

          <p>China is strengthening its position as a key partner for African nations by expanding duty-free access for nearly all products from 53 countries on the continent. This move stands in stark contrast to recent U.S. policies, which include levying tariffs, cutting foreign aid, and imposing visa restrictions on several African nations. As a result, observers note that Beijing is winning a major narrative victory, with many African governments increasingly viewing China as a more reliable and beneficial partner than the United States.</p>
