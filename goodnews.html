          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malaysia during a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This meeting represents one of the most significant diplomatic engagements between the two nations since President Trump's second term began. Tensions remain high over issues including trade, Taiwan's sovereignty, and China's support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, all of which are expected to be key topics of discussion. The dialogue aims to navigate these complex challenges amid a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a tentative ruling that signals she will order the Trump Administration to cease indiscriminate stops and arrests of immigrants in the Los Angeles area. The lawsuit, brought by civil rights groups, argues that federal agents have been targeting individuals based on their appearance without probable cause, creating a climate of fear. The judge appeared to question the government's lack of specific evidence to justify its agents' actions during the hearing.</p>

          <p>A swift and massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department led to the successful rescue of 31 construction workers who were trapped following a tunnel collapse in Wilmington. The workers, who were part of a major sanitation district project, were trapped for about an hour before being able to climb over a debris pile to safety. Fortunately, none of the rescued individuals sustained any visible injuries, and the incident is now under investigation by state workplace safety officials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again blocked President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants or foreign visitors. The ruling came from a New Hampshire judge who approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, arguing the order violates the 14th Amendment. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that placed limits on such nationwide injunctions but did not eliminate them entirely.</p>

Such meteorites are exceedingly rare, and this particular piece represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, offering a significant dataset for scientific research.</p>

The article explores the power of memorable slogans such as "Get Brexit Done" and "Make America Great Again," which can define a campaign and capture a specific political moment. It also looks toward the future, where AI and neuroscience are increasingly being used to tailor political messaging to individual voters.</p>
