          <h2>Training Program Aims to Eliminate 'Elderspeak' in Care Settings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:34:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is designed to reduce the use of 'elderspeak,' a communication style resembling baby talk, when interacting with older adults. Clarissa Shaw defines elderspeak as communication that assumes frailty, incompetence, and dependence, often involving terms of endearment or plural pronouns. Studies show that elderspeak can lead to resistance to care, and CHAT has demonstrated success in reducing both elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes. The program is now being adapted for online use to reach more facilities and promote respectful communication with older individuals.</p>

          <p>Following the release of internal reports revealing the presence of antisemitism and Islamophobia at Harvard, adjunct professor Eugene Litvak acknowledged the university's unpreparedness for the challenges that emerged after the October 7th Hamas attack. Litvak commended Harvard's president for addressing the problem, but Donald Trump announced his administration would revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status. Litvak also stressed the importance of addressing the financial dangers facing public healthcare programs, advocating for improved efficiency in existing systems before implementing budget cuts. The future of research grants at Harvard remains uncertain amid ongoing tensions with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, overcoming earlier poll deficits amid a cost-of-living crisis. His center-left Labor Party defeated the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who faced challenges due to campaign missteps and association with Trump's policies. The election outcome reflects a preference for stability amidst global uncertainty arising from the Trump administration. It remains to be seen if Albanese's party will maintain its parliamentary majority, given the increased presence of independent and minor-party candidates.</p>

          <p>A widespread blackout across the Iberian Peninsula led to unexpected acts of kindness and community spirit, as described by Paco Cerd√†. During the 10-hour outage, citizens directed traffic, provided food and water to stranded travelers, and schools remained open late to accommodate children. The author contrasts this experience with the individualistic ethos promoted by the far right, emphasizing the trust and mutual support fostered by the European welfare state. The blackout highlighted the strength of community and the importance of mutual support in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>Frances Lee, a professor of politics, discusses the political failures during the Covid-19 pandemic, emphasizing the truncated debate and the departure from conventional pandemic handling wisdom.

Lee stresses the importance of acknowledging uncertainty and diverse values in policymaking, as well as resisting moralized antagonism. She argues that science alone cannot settle political questions and that transparency and accountability are crucial for effective crisis management.</p>

          <p>A Member of Parliament is advocating for a modern approach to the regulations prohibiting alcohol consumption in football stands, which have been in place since 1985. The current law bans fans from drinking alcohol within view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football, but other sports are exempt. Trials are taking place in the women's game to assess the impact of lifting these restrictions. The MP suggests small-scale trials in the lower leagues to determine a suitable path forward.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. The study tracked axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands, noting their ability to survive, gain weight, and avoid predators. This success highlights the potential for reintroduction programs to aid in the conservation of axolotls and mitigate the effects of habitat degradation. The findings are particularly significant for Mexicans, as axolotls are deeply rooted in their culture and history.</p>
