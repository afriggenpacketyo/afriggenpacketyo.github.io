          <p>In an interview discussing his new memoir, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concern that the current court has become "a little bit too personal and confrontational."

Kennedy defended his past rulings, including those recently overturned, and emphasized the importance of civility in public discourse, warning that its absence puts democracy in danger.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert outlines seven common yet toxic habits that can hinder a child's development of mental fortitude. These include rescuing children from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing their big emotions, and prizing achievement over effort. The author suggests that building resilience involves allowing kids to face age-appropriate challenges, modeling accountability for mistakes, and validating their feelings. This approach helps children learn to regulate their emotions, trust themselves, and rebound from setbacks, fostering true mental and emotional strength.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist and that the books' core message of rejecting discrimination remains valuable, even if flawed. Rather than simply boycotting or making offsetting donations, the columnist suggests actively and critically engaging with the content in a community setting, using the problematic elements as a catalyst for important real-world discussions about justice and systemic change.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney stated that the precedent set in 2011, when the SNP's majority win in Holyrood led to the 2014 independence referendum, should apply again if his party secures a majority in the next election. At the SNP conference, delegates backed a strategy to treat the next election as a de-facto poll on independence. However, the UK Labour government, which would need to approve a new vote, has reiterated its opposition, though Swinney argues that legal and political precedent strengthens Scotland's case.</p>
