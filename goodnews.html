          <p>FIFA is contemplating scheduling 2026 World Cup matches involving European nations after midnight UK time to mitigate extreme heat issues in the host cities across North America. This consideration follows complaints from managers and players about midday games in near-40-degree temperatures during the recent Club World Cup. While late kickoffs would be less than ideal for European broadcasters, organizers are prioritizing player welfare. A top FIFA official acknowledged that scheduling is a major challenge, and they are in discussions with media partners to find the best compromise for the 48-team tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to help stabilize its currency, a move seen as a pragmatic exception to its "America First" rhetoric. The article supports the bailout, arguing that the success of President Javier Milei's free-market reforms is crucial for promoting economic and political liberalism in Latin America. While Milei has made significant progress in curbing inflation, a mismanaged currency devaluation has jeopardized his agenda. The proposed loan, from a long-standing Federal Reserve credit line, is presented as a wise risk to prevent Argentina's economic collapse and discredit authoritarianism in the region.

          <p>NASA has designated employees working on the Artemis moon missions as essential, requiring them to continue their work with contractors like SpaceX and Blue Origin during the government shutdown. Although their work will be unpaid until the shutdown ends, the agency has prioritized the lunar exploration program, alongside operations of the International Space Station and other active satellite missions. Approximately 3,000 of NASA's 18,000 staff will continue working. This decision ensures that progress on key projects, including the development of lunar landers, will not be halted by the federal funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock saw a 7% increase after a report revealed the company is in preliminary discussions to manufacture chips for its primary competitor, AMD, through its foundry business. Securing a major rival like AMD as a customer would be a significant victory for Intel Foundry, validating its manufacturing capabilities and potentially attracting other clients. While the extent of the potential partnership is unclear, it signals growing confidence in Intel's turnaround strategy under its new CEO. AMD, which currently relies on TSMC for its chip production, has not commented on the speculation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the origins of cumbia music along the Caribbean coast of Colombia, tracing its roots to the cultural fusion of enslaved Africans, Indigenous peoples, and European colonizers. Born in the wetlands of the Mompos Depression, the genre's rhythm is driven by African drums, its melodies by Indigenous flutes, and its lyrical structure by European influences. The story highlights the crucial role of Black and Afro-descendant women in preserving and transmitting this musical legacy through generations. It also explores how cumbia, once marginalized, became a symbol of peace and a celebrated national treasure.</p>

          <p>NPR has launched a special series, "Cumbia Across Latin America," that visually documents the journey of cumbia music from its origins to its current status as a globally recognized genre. Once the soundtrack of the working class, cumbia's infectious rhythm has traveled with migrants, absorbing local styles and reinventing itself across continents. The series explores how this music, born from a mix of African, Indigenous, and European influences, has become a powerful symbol of Latin American identity. Photographers will take audiences on a journey through six countries to meet the people and see the places that keep cumbia alive.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied President Trump's request to immediately remove Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve governor, allowing her to remain in the role for now. The court will hear arguments in the case in January. President Trump had attempted to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Cook sued, arguing the firing was an illegal attempt at political interference with the independent central bank. This ruling is a setback for the president in his ongoing conflict with the Fed over its interest rate policies.</p>

While local offices are slated to remain open, the agency will furlough about 6,000 employees and reduce certain services. Essential functions like applying for benefits and appealing decisions will continue, but services such as obtaining proof of income letters or replacing Medicare cards will not be available. The shutdown could, however, delay the release of key inflation data needed to calculate the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing against home equity has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A new $70,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term could now have a monthly payment of around $677, which is marginally lower than it would have been earlier in the year. The article advises homeowners to carefully calculate their ability to repay before borrowing, as failure to do so can result in foreclosure. It also suggests comparing home equity loans with other options like HELOCs to determine the most financially sound choice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by a surge in demand for electric vehicles. Consumers rushed to purchase EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September, leading to record quarterly EV sales for both automakers. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's increased by 30%. The industry-wide sales pace was stronger than expected, though some executives anticipate a slowdown in EV demand in October now that the federal credits have ended.</p>

The company's IPO occurred on the first day of a government shutdown, which has forced the federally run National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to stop processing new applications and claims. Neptune's CEO highlighted that his company remains open for business, able to serve homeowners who need flood insurance to close on their properties. The company uses AI to assess risk on individual properties, offering an alternative to the government program. (not investment advice)</p>
