        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Euro 2025 quarter-final between England and Sweden is being billed as a decisive contest, with analysts identifying key on-pitch battles that will likely determine the outcome. One critical matchup will be between England's defensive duo, Leah Williamson and Jess Carter, and Sweden's speedy striker Stina Blackstenius, who is known for her intelligent runs behind the backline. Another focal point will be the flank, where England's Alex Greenwood will be tasked with containing the dangerous dribbling and crossing of Sweden's Johanna Rytting Kaneryd. The midfield battle is also seen as crucial, with England's balanced trio needing to counter Sweden's creative and physical presence.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans to Lower National Voting Age to 16</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 05:40:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for general elections, a change that would enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali stated the move would ensure young people's voices are heard on critical issues. The reform is part of a new Elections Bill that also includes expanding acceptable voter ID to include bank cards and moving toward automatic voter registration. This represents the most significant expansion of the UK electorate since the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969, aligning general elections with the existing rules for local elections in Scotland and Wales.</p>

          <p>A large fire has destroyed the main stage of the Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival in Boom, Belgium, just days before it was set to begin. Despite the significant damage, organizers have confirmed that the event, which expects 400,000 attendees over two weekends, will go ahead. No one was injured in the blaze, and the cause is currently under investigation by experts. The festival has 14 other stages, and organizers are working with local authorities on contingency plans to manage the event without its primary performance area. Campers have already begun arriving as the festival prepares for its Friday opening.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has set a new world record in women's football by signing 20-year-old Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool for a £1 million fee. Smith, who made her international debut at 15, has signed a four-year contract with the Champions League holders. The transfer surpasses the previous record of £900,000 set by Chelsea's signing of Naomi Girma. Smith's move marks a significant moment in the financial growth of the women's game, with her transfer fee being equivalent to the first £1 million transfer in men's football 46 years ago. Liverpool will receive the payment in installments and secured a sell-on clause.</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars reported a second-quarter operating profit that exceeded analyst expectations, even as it faced a significant year-over-year decline. The company, owned by China's Geely Holding, is adapting its US strategy in response to high tariffs by shifting production. Volvo plans to begin manufacturing its best-selling XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant in late 2026, while simultaneously phasing out sedans and station wagons that have seen waning interest. This strategic pivot aims to better utilize its US factory and mitigate the financial impact of tariffs on imported vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that the most significant impact of artificial intelligence will be in the realm of science, particularly in fields like drug discovery. Speaking at an expo in Beijing, Huang argued that while applying AI to human language is relatively straightforward, using it to understand the complex language of biology represents a more profound challenge with greater potential. He emphasized that AI can help researchers learn the meaning of proteins, cells, and life itself, ultimately leading to the design of new medicines and longer, healthier lives. This perspective underscores a major shift in focus towards leveraging AI for fundamental scientific breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>Maryland has become the first US state to utilize a fund established under the Affordable Care Act to cover expenses for patients traveling from other states for abortion care. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, states where abortion remains legal have seen a surge in patients, straining the resources of nonprofit abortion funds that assist with travel and lodging costs. The new Maryland law allows the state to tap into a $25 million account, funded by fees from insurers on the ACA marketplace, to provide grants to these organizations. This innovative approach aims to ensure clinics can continue serving both local and out-of-state patients without financial barriers.</p>

          <p>A potential new trade deal between the US and China is likely to mirror the structure of the phase one agreement from Donald Trump's first term, according to former Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Biegun suggested the core of any new agreement would involve substantial Chinese purchases of American agricultural and industrial goods. This approach aligns with the previous deal, which aimed to rebalance the trade deficit, a key metric for the Trump administration. The original 2020 agreement was only partially fulfilled, a factor that current negotiators are reportedly taking into account. (not investment advice)</p>

However, challenges remain, as Tesla's high-priced Model Y targets a niche luxury market, and the company must build a fast-charging network from scratch.
