          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has signed a major $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to an undisclosed major corporation, with the deal running until the end of July 2030. While the customer's identity remains confidential, reports suggest it is the electric vehicle maker Tesla. This agreement is one of LG's largest for lithium iron phosphate batteries and is expected to bolster its position in the U.S. energy storage market. The deal comes as the company expands its manufacturing presence in the United States, including a new plant in Michigan that recently began production and another under construction in Arizona.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and just within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range of 2-3%. The figure was slightly below economists' expectations, strengthening the argument for another interest rate cut by the central bank. While the RBA has already cut rates twice this year, it held them steady in its last meeting to ensure inflation was firmly under control. Analysts now widely anticipate a 25-basis-point cut at the RBA's upcoming August meeting, citing the favorable inflation data, a weaker global growth outlook, and rising domestic unemployment.

          <p>China's eastern coast, including Shanghai, is now bracing for a severe tropical storm after a tsunami alert for the region was lifted. The yellow alert was initially issued following the powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula, with warnings of waves up to one meter. However, the tsunami threat subsided, and authorities cancelled the alert in the early afternoon. The focus has now shifted to Typhoon Co-May, which is expected to make landfall, bringing severe winds and heavy rainfall to Shanghai and the surrounding Zhejiang province on Wednesday evening.</p>

          <p>Victory Giant Technology, a major Chinese manufacturer of printed circuit boards and a supplier to Nvidia, has announced its intention to pursue a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The company, already listed in Shenzhen, plans to sell stock representing up to 10% of its existing share capital to raise funds for overseas expansion and to diversify its financing channels.

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.4 billion, doubling its earnings from the previous year and significantly beating analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by its investment bank and global wealth management divisions, which benefited from high market volatility early in the quarter. Despite the positive results, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients remain in a "wait-and-see" mode amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. The bank is also continuing its integration of Credit Suisse and navigating a dispute with Swiss regulators over proposed new capital requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

In Southern California, where small waves were predicted, many beachgoers were unaware of the advisory, while others pondered their lack of an emergency plan. In Crescent City, a Northern California town historically vulnerable to tsunamis, locals in a pub were reportedly blasé, accustomed to such alerts.

          <p>Despite the UK's FTSE-100 stock index reaching record highs and outperforming many global peers this year, this article argues it is not a reliable barometer of the UK's domestic economy. The analysis explains that the index's strength is largely due to its high concentration of multinational corporations that earn the vast majority of their revenue overseas. A weaker pound, for instance, boosts the value of these foreign earnings, lifting the index even if the UK economy is struggling. The composition of the Footsie has shifted dramatically over four decades from domestically-focused companies to global giants in sectors like mining, energy, and pharmaceuticals.

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6 million settlement with Jewish students and a professor who sued the university over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The lawsuit argued that UCLA violated their civil rights by allowing protesters to block access to classes and other campus areas, creating a hostile environment. This settlement follows a separate finding by the U.S. Department of Justice that UCLA acted with 'deliberate indifference' toward Jewish and Israeli students. As part of the agreement, UCLA will pay damages and legal fees and commit to ensuring equal campus access for all community members.</p>

The city, which launched mainland China's first personal bankruptcy pilot in 2021, will now publicly disclose a debtor's bankruptcy information for up to eight years after their debts are discharged. Since its inception, the program has processed over 500 cases but has not yet fully discharged any individual's debts. Legal experts note the pace is slow compared to demand, especially from small business owners impacted by the economic downturn, and have called for bolder reforms to provide a true second chance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine invertebrate may have practiced a form of "social distancing" to ensure its survival. The findings are based on 436-million-year-old fossils of a brachiopod species found in Guizhou province, which were arranged in a highly regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the former sea floor. Researchers believe the creatures used hundreds of flexible, bristle-like structures, thinner than a human hair, to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing. This arrangement likely improved their ability to filter feed from the water without competing with each other, demonstrating an ancient example of complex behavioral adaptation.</p>
