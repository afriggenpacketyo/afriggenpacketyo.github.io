          <p>An academician from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging the nation to expedite its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States. This technology involves orbiting facilities that convert solar energy into electricity and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action highlights that China's current research, led by universities, lacks the capacity for such a large-scale project. The expert emphasizes the need for a top-down national strategy to close the technological gap with the U.S., which has been experimenting with this concept since the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate paid as a deposit for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A London court granted forfeiture orders after the police argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, which Tate and his brother did not contest. The money, originally from a cryptocurrency account, had no tax or VAT paid on it. This seizure adds to the £2.7 million previously confiscated from the Tate brothers by the same police force for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses.</p>

          <p>A non-profit program called Dec My Dorm is helping to ease the transition to college for students from the foster care system by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. The initiative was started after its founder learned that many foster youth arrive on campus with minimal belongings, lacking basic items like pillows, sheets, and towels. The program hosts an annual event where students can select their own bedding and other necessities, aiming to level the playing field and ensure they feel prepared and equal to their peers. This support addresses a critical gap, as these students often lack the family and financial resources to furnish their new living spaces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to ground herself and prepare for the day, especially as someone prone to anxiety. Her core practice is simple but non-negotiable: waking up early when her alarm goes off, no matter what. This creates a personal, unhurried block of time before work and family duties begin. She uses this "creative hour" for rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, allowing the specific routine to be flexible. This approach prevents her from feeling rushed and sets a positive, non-chaotic tone for the rest of her day.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are preparing to move into a new, larger home within Windsor Great Park later this year. The family will relocate to the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, which is a short distance from their current four-bedroom home, Adelaide Cottage. This move will allow them to remain close to their children's school, Lambrook School, which they have been attending since 2022. The relocation comes after the royal couple moved from Kensington Palace to Windsor to provide their children with more privacy and a more normal upbringing away from central London.</p>

          <p>Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney saved Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre in Orefield, Pennsylvania, the world's oldest operating drive-in, from being sold to developers. The couple invested their life savings and took out a $1 million loan in 2022 to purchase the historic theater, which first opened in 1934. By operating year-round and hosting community events like craft fairs and trunk-or-treats, they have modernized the business model while preserving its vintage charm. After an initial struggle, the theater became profitable in 2024, bringing in nearly $550,000 in revenue and ensuring the preservation of a beloved local landmark.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer new form factors beyond the traditional smartphone slate. The company's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly to premium foldables, is attracting a broader customer base. In response, Apple is expected to release a slimmer iPhone and may introduce its own foldable device by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fugitive Jamie Rothwell, who ran a multi-million-pound drugs and weapons operation from Spain, was captured after inadvertently revealing his location to police through a selfie. He shared the photo on EncroChat, an encrypted messaging service that had been secretly compromised by international law enforcement. This crucial mistake allowed detectives to identify him as the user "livelong" and pinpoint his Barcelona apartment. The hacked messages also exposed his role in trafficking AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting. Rothwell was extradited to the UK and has been sentenced to 43 years in prison for his crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to develop emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative emotions. First, she advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that the struggle and frustration of learning something new is a normal part of the process. Second, she recommends engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult situations as manageable challenges rather than failures. Finally, Kennedy suggests taking on small, uncomfortable "experiments," like having a difficult conversation, to gradually build your body's tolerance for discomfort and foster resilience in all areas of life.</p>

The announcement came after Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which he described as "very successful." Trump stated that he, Zelenskyy, and European leaders determined a direct peace agreement, rather than a ceasefire, is the best path forward. If the meeting with Zelenskyy is productive, Trump plans to schedule a subsequent meeting with Putin, expressing hope that such a deal could save millions of lives.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that alcohol consumption among Americans has fallen to its lowest point since tracking began in 1939, with only 54% of adults reporting that they drink. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and growing public concern over the health impacts of alcohol, as a majority now believe even moderate drinking is unhealthy. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with reported drinking by high school seniors dropping from 75% in 1997 to 42% in 2024. This shift represents a significant public health positive, potentially reducing alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social harms.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited a series of posts where Stewartson accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and of planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court filings, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described the legal action as an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting on Patel.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is turning to well-known, older candidates for some of its most critical 2026 Senate races, highlighting a tension between the need to win and the desire for generational change. In Ohio, 72-year-old former Senator Sherrod Brown is planning a comeback bid, while in North Carolina, 68-year-old former Governor Roy Cooper is being heavily recruited. While some activists lament the reliance on a party gerontocracy, strategists argue that these proven winners offer the best chance to compete in challenging red-leaning states. The trend contrasts with other races where younger Democrats are emerging, but it underscores the party's pragmatic approach in must-win contests.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American archaeology student from the University of Newcastle, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first excavation in the United Kingdom. The find occurred in Northumberland, near the route of a major Roman road, just 90 minutes into her dig. The decorative object, likely used for religious or ceremonial purposes by elites, is considered an exceptional find and provides insight into high-status travel and activity in the area long after the Roman Empire's fall. It was found near the site of a similar discovery in 2021, suggesting the two may have been deliberately buried together.</p>
