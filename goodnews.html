          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant reduction in the number of individuals listed as missing following devastating floods. The count dropped from nearly 100 to just three after extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies verified that most were safe. This development brings a measure of relief to a community that saw its missing persons list exceed 160 at its peak. However, the overall death toll from the statewide flooding event remains high at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt has responded to long-standing rumors of a feud with her former co-star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, stating they are unfounded. Hewitt revealed that she has not spoken to or seen Gellar since they worked on the 1997 film "I Know What You Did Last Summer" when she was 18. The speculation was recently fueled by Gellar's reactions to questions about the movie's new sequel and social media omissions. Gellar has since clarified her actions were related to non-disclosure agreements and event logistics, not animosity.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to introduce a new law targeting individuals who plan mass violence, even without a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This would empower authorities to apprehend individuals who research targets or otherwise prepare for an attack before they can act. The move is a direct response to cases where attackers were fixated on violence but did not fit the legal definition of a terrorist.</p>

The move signals the team's growing concern over the slump of one of its key players as they navigate the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor has stated a goal to shift the nation's financial habits from risk-averse saving to more active investing in stocks and shares. The government is considering measures like sending targeted messages to savers with low-interest accounts and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize investment. Critics argue this approach could backfire if new investors face losses in volatile markets, while others point out the need to address the gender gap in investing and use less intimidating language.

These modern clubs offer a more relaxed alternative to traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which are often inaccessible due to long waiting lists and a focus on "old money" legacy. While still highly exclusive with expensive fees, their membership criteria are based more on personal accomplishment than family pedigree. This trend reflects the significant economic and social shifts occurring in modern India.</p>
