          <p>Warsaw's pro-EU mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, narrowly won the first round of Poland's presidential election with 31.36% of the vote, edging out national-conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki, who received 29.54%.

Trzaskowski's victory provides an opportunity for Prime Minister Donald Tusk to advance his EU-friendly reform agenda, which has been hampered by the current nationalist president. The article notes that the support of voters who backed far-right candidates eliminated in the first round will be crucial in the upcoming runoff.</p>
