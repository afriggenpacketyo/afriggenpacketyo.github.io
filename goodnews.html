        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The women's football transfer record has been broken five times in 2025, with the latest move seeing Grace Geyoro sign for London City Lionesses for approximately €1.6 million. This rapid increase in transfer fees, primarily driven by investment in England's WSL and the US's NWSL, is seen as a positive sign of the sport's commercial growth. However, experts express concern that this financial boom could widen the competitive gap between the wealthiest leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga. The trend highlights the sport's increasing marketability but also poses challenges for maintaining competitive balance across different leagues globally.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed, showing a relatively muted response to the U.S. government shutdown as Wall Street had previously posted gains. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 declined, while the central bank's Tankan survey indicated a slight increase in business optimism among large manufacturers. Meanwhile, India's Nifty 50 and Sensex indices rose after the Reserve Bank of India decided to hold interest rates steady at 5.5%. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday, limiting the regional reaction to the political turmoil in Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

The White Ferns are entering the 50-over World Cup as the surprising reigning T20 World Cup champions, a title they won despite not being considered favorites. Kerr believes the team thrives with the "underdog" label and can use the lack of external pressure to their advantage. Despite inconsistent ODI form leading up to the tournament, both Kerr and head coach Ben Sawyer believe the squad has the potential to beat any team on their day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept its policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a decision that was widely expected by economists. The central bank is pausing to evaluate the economic effects of previous rate cuts amid moderating inflation and potential growth deceleration due to global trade uncertainties. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee noted that the full impact of a significant 50-basis-point cut from June has yet to be realized. The bank forecasts 6.8% economic growth for fiscal year 2026 but acknowledged that trade headwinds could slightly lower projections for later quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Slipper, the most-capped player in Australian rugby history, has announced he will retire from international duty following this weekend's Test match against New Zealand.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is upgrading its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) to a full stock market listing in the United States, a move aimed at attracting a broader base of global investors and accessing deeper capital pools. While this has fueled speculation about the company potentially leaving the London Stock Exchange (LSE), AstraZeneca has affirmed its commitment to remaining a UK-headquartered and tax-resident company. The decision follows a trend of several major companies shifting their primary listings away from London, raising concerns about the LSE's competitiveness, though AZ's case may be more about expansion than departure.

          <p>New regulations in England now prohibit price promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, on food and drink products high in fat, salt, or sugar. The ban, which applies to supermarkets and other large retailers, is a government measure aimed at tackling rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health advocates have welcomed the long-delayed move, arguing that such promotions do not save consumers money and instead encourage over-consumption. This restriction follows a 2022 ban on placing unhealthy products in prominent store locations like checkouts, which research suggests has already reduced junk food sales.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its offshore energy infrastructure, with its network of subsea pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers. This was marked by the completion of a final pipeline section in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expanding network is crucial for China's strategy to enhance energy security by exploiting offshore resources. State media reports that the pipelines are also designed to transport greener fuels like hydrogen in the future, with plans to expand the total network to over 13,000 kilometers by 2030.</p>

          <p>After one year as NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte is largely seen as having successfully navigated a challenging period, particularly in managing relations with the re-elected US President Donald Trump. His primary test was maintaining U.S. commitment to the alliance, which he accomplished through diplomatic efforts that, while sometimes criticized as overly flattering, resulted in a renewed U.S. pledge to defend the alliance. Foreign policy experts have generally given Rutte high marks for securing increased defense spending from European allies and keeping the alliance unified. However, they note that future challenges, including direct Russian provocations, will continue to test his leadership.</p>

          <p>A new government mandate requires every GP practice in England to provide online appointment booking services throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. This measure aims to end the "8am scramble," where patients rush to call for appointments as soon as phone lines open. In addition to booking non-urgent slots, patients can use the online systems to ask questions and request callbacks. Despite initial calls for a delay from the British Medical Association over safety concerns, ministers have proceeded with the plan, arguing it will modernize the NHS and free up phone lines for urgent cases.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a commanding 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series. The offense was explosive, matching a franchise playoff record with five home runs, including two each from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell was superb over seven innings, largely silencing the Reds' bats. However, the team's bullpen showed signs of weakness, allowing three runs in a tense eighth inning that highlighted ongoing concerns. Despite the late-game disorder, the Dodgers' dominant performance puts them one win away from advancing.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in the skilled trades over pursuing a traditional college degree, driven by concerns over student loan debt and the threat of AI automating white-collar jobs. A recent survey shows that Gen Z values job security from automation, viewing professions like electricians and plumbers as safer than fields like accounting or data analytics. This shift marks a change in perception, where blue-collar work is increasingly seen as a viable and respectable path to a successful, independent career. Experts note the stigma around trades is diminishing as young people recognize the potential for high earnings.</p>
