          <p>Atlanta police successfully prevented a potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after a Georgia man, Billy Joe Cagle, was reported by his family for threatening to "shoot it up" during a livestream. Officers located Cagle's truck, finding a Springfield AR-15 assault rifle and 27 rounds of ammunition, then apprehended him inside the terminal, believing he was scouting the area. Mayor Andre Dickens and Police Chief Darren Schierbaum credited the family's timely alert and swift law enforcement response for averting a tragedy, emphasizing the deadly combination of mental health crises and firearms. Cagle faces charges including terroristic threats and criminal attempt to commit aggravated assault.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Western Perspective on China Risks War, Urging a Shift from Historical Mirroring</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 17:30:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Western framework, exemplified by Graham Allison's "Thucydides Trap," risks leading to war by projecting Western historical patterns of aggression onto China. The author contends that China's 5,000-year history, shaped by its land-bound geography and agricultural heartlands, fosters a defensive cultural DNA rather than one of outward conquest, contrasting with European and Japanese imperialism. To avert conflict, the West must "shatter the mirror" of its own history and recognize China's distinct cultural and historical motivations. The article emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of China's strategic intent, moving beyond assumptions of inevitable rivalry.</p>

          <h2>Cannabis-Infused Beverages Gain Popularity as Americans Reduce Alcohol Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 17:19:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and/or CBD, are experiencing a surge in popularity as Americans increasingly reduce their alcohol intake, with consumption hitting its lowest level since 1939. Sales of THC beverages are projected to grow from $1.1 billion to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, driven by consumer demand for non-alcoholic, lower-calorie alternatives. While many brands market health benefits, doctors warn of potential side effects including anxiety, paranoia, and impaired cognitive function, particularly with heavy or long-term use. The market's growth is supported by evolving regulations in 44 states, leading major retailers like Target to test sales, reflecting a 'seismic shift' in consumer preference.

          <p>Los Angeles is hosting a new art exhibition, 'Monuments,' featuring decommissioned Confederate statues, including melted-down bronze from a Robert E. Lee monument and a graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson. Curator Hamza Walker aims to confront the 'Lost Cause ideology' and white supremacy these figures represent, contrasting with President Trump's calls to reinstall such monuments. The exhibition displays the statues alongside contemporary art, such as a replica of the 'General Lee' car, to challenge revisionist history and spark dialogue. One centerpiece is Kara Walker's transformed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson, rethinking his legacy as a mythological holder for white supremacy.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines Boeing 737, Flight 1093 from Denver to Los Angeles, was forced to make an early landing in Salt Lake City after its windscreen cracked midflight. The incident, which occurred near Moab, Utah, resulted in the pilot sustaining a bloodied and cut arm. Photos showed the exterior of the plane with a shattered windscreen. All 140 passengers and crew landed safely, and passengers were transferred to a different aircraft to complete their journey to Los Angeles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that a tiny eye implant combined with special glasses, known as the photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA), has helped some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy regain the ability to read. Out of 32 participants, 26 showed significant improvement in visual acuity 12 months post-implantation. The treatment involves inserting a hair-thin microchip under the retina and wearing glasses that project images via near-infrared light. While the technology requires concentration and is not yet licensed, it offers 'out of this world' potential for patients like Sheila Irvine, marking a significant breakthrough in vision restoration for a condition affecting 5 million worldwide.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 16:41:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California health officials reported three unrelated cases of clade I mpox, a more severe strain of the virus, marking its first spread within the US without recent international travel. The patients, from Long Beach and Los Angeles County, were hospitalized but are now recovering. Clade I mpox has caused widespread disease and deaths in parts of Africa, and its presence in California necessitates careful evaluation, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems. Officials emphasize the importance of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine, which protects against both clade I and II strains, to reduce disease severity, though the overall risk to the public remains low.</p>

          <p>LeBron James is no longer facing a small claims lawsuit from a fan seeking $865.66 for Lakers tickets, bought under the impression James would retire. Andrew Garcia dropped the case after accepting an offer from PrizePicks fantasy sports app, which deposited the full ticket amount in promo funds and offered additional merchandise and game tickets. Garcia had filed the suit after James's 'Second Decision' announcement, widely speculated to be a retirement, turned out to be unrelated to his NBA career, now entering its 23rd season. The incident highlights the impact of celebrity social media teasers on fan expectations and market behavior.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and intended flexibility of the U.S. Constitution, highlighting its design for amendment, exemplified by the 13th and 19th Amendments. Historian Jill Lepore emphasizes that the Founders expected constant revision, with over 200 amendments proposed by states leading to the Bill of Rights. While the Constitution was a tangle of compromises, including over slavery, James Madison intentionally avoided endorsing it, hoping future generations would eradicate it. Despite its enduring principles, experts like Jeffrey Rosen worry that checks-and-balances are not currently working as intended, with Congress inactive and courts overly powerful, deviating from the Founders' vision of deliberation and debate.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies climbed as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and the Trump administration's efforts to build a domestic supply chain. President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement to invest in joint ventures for critical mineral supply chains independent of China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the administration would set price floors for industries like rare earths to combat Chinese market manipulation. Companies such as NioCorp, Energy Fuels, and USA Rare Earth saw significant gains, with William Blair initiating outperform coverage on USA Rare Earth, anticipating a material stake from the Trump administration.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland-Cliffs shares surged over 20% after CEO Lourenco Goncalves announced the steelmaker is exploring building a rare earths mining business. Geological surveys at two sites in Michigan and Minnesota have indicated rare earth deposits, which, if commercially viable, would align with the Trump administration's strategy for critical mineral independence. Rare earths are essential for magnets used in weapons, electric vehicles, and semiconductors, and the U.S. is currently dependent on China for imports. This move positions Cleveland-Cliffs to potentially benefit from government industrial policy, similar to a deal struck with MP Materials, as the U.S. seeks to reduce its reliance on Beijing.
