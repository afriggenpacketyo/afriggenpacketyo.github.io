          <p>Pattern Group, a leading third-party seller on Amazon, made its public debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange, with its stock opening slightly below its initial public offering price. The company, which functions as an "ecommerce accelerator" for over 200 brands, raised $300 million in its IPO, valuing it at approximately $2.5 billion. The debut occurs during a revitalized tech IPO market but also faces uncertainty from global trade tensions and the company's significant reliance on the Amazon marketplace for its revenue.</p>

American Melissa Jefferson-Wooden won the gold, completing a sweep of the sprint titles.

Citing early indications of strong consumer demand and positive remarks from CEO Tim Cook, Cramer suggests that Wall Street's initial sales expectations may have been too conservative. He argues that this could be a breakout moment for Apple's stock, despite ongoing concerns about the company's AI strategy and competition in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and Penguin Random House, labeling the complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday struck down the suit for violating civil procedure rules, criticizing its eighty pages of repetitive claims and political rhetoric rather than a plain statement of facts. The judge did not rule on the merits of the defamation claim, giving Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile the lawsuit in a more appropriate format.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has stated he does not believe President Donald Trump's tariffs are causing macroeconomically significant inflation, placing him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the Fed's recent decision to cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point, had advocated for a larger half-point reduction. He argued there is no material evidence of tariffs driving up overall inflation and suggested that changes in immigration policy would have a more disinflationary effect on the economy.

          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) more affordable for homeowners. With approximately $11.6 trillion in tappable home equity available in the U.S., a $50,000 HELOC now has a lower monthly payment compared to previous months. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are directly influenced by the Fed's monetary policy, making them a potentially cheaper borrowing option than fixed-rate home equity loans or high-interest credit cards for accessing home equity.
