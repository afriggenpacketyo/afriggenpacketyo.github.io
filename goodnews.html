          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S.-Israeli strikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon analysis suggesting a limited setback. Trump highlighted Iranian reports of significant damage and dismissed the need for further negotiations, stating the "war's done." He likened the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II and expressed optimism about future U.S.-Iranian relations, noting their agreement to a ceasefire. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's position, criticizing the leak of the preliminary intelligence report as politically motivated. The president's opponents in Washington, including Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons, called for answers and a return to negotiations. Optimism from the president followed after the dust settled.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in its incarceration rate after decades of mass imprisonment. The prison population, which peaked in 2009, has decreased by roughly 60% and is expected to continue falling. This trend is attributed to a decline in crime rates and an aging prison population, with fewer young offenders entering the system. States are encouraged to tear down deteriorated correctional facilities and shift resources from prisons to other policy priorities such as education, which costs less than imprisoning someone for a year.</p>

This phase involves constructing connectors to the north and south sides of the freeway, allowing animals to easily cross between the Santa Susana Mountains and the Santa Monica Mountains. The project faces challenges, including burying overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and preserving a grove of native oak trees.

          <h2>Netanyahu Celebrates as Israel Strikes Iran</h2>

          <p>After decades of rhetoric and 20 months of war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming a "historic victory" following strikes on Iran. For years, Netanyahu wanted to attack Iran, but the United States and his own security chiefs deterred him. Israel used to be deterred from attacking Iran by the threat of retaliation from enemies on its borders, but those threats were beaten back in the last few years of war. Netanyahu's focus on Iran has also benefited him over the years, helping distract from Israel's unresolved conflict with the Palestinians.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Against Receivership for L.A.‚Äôs Homeless Programs</h2>

          <p>A federal judge declined to place Los Angeles‚Äô homelessness programs into receivership, but concluded that the city failed to adhere to the terms of a settlement agreement. Judge David O. Carter found that the city breached the agreement with the LA Alliance for Human Rights by failing to create 12,915 homeless beds by June 2027. To address these shortcomings, Carter ordered the selection of a third-party monitor to review and verify the data being produced by the city. He also signaled that he would likely order the city to pay the legal fees of both the alliance and homeless advocacy groups.</p>

          <h2>Communication Mistake People Make</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 10:08:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public speaking consultant Bill McGowan says that the biggest communication mistake people make is leaning too much into corporate jargon, using bland and boring words and phrases in an attempt to seem smart and memorable. McGowan, who's coached a variety of celebrities, CEOs and politicians including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Kim Kardashian, says that it confuses people and sounds really inauthentic. He says that it's important to write for the ear, not the eye, and to use simple, authentic language.</p>
