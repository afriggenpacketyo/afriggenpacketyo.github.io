California Attorney General Rob Bonta emphasized that mifepristone is safer than Tylenol and that the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program is medically unjustified.

          <h2>Trade Deficit Falls by Record Amount as Import Demand Drops</h2>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record-breaking decline in April, driven by a sharp decrease in import demand due to President Trump's tariffs. The deficit fell to $61.6 billion, a decrease of $76.7 billion from the prior month. Imports slowed significantly, while exports accelerated, reversing a previous surge in the trade imbalance. Despite the decrease, the year-to-date deficit remains higher than the same period in 2024. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A Vox article explores the pressure children and teenagers face to have a "best friend" and highlights the value of diverse friendships. Experts suggest that kids need a repertoire of anchors rather than relying solely on one best friend. The article emphasizes that not all friends can help with every single thing and that different friendships serve different purposes. The article suggests that having a network of supportive relationships is more important than conforming to the ideal of a singular best friend. </p>
