          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to a larger-than-expected oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day for August. This decision accelerates the unwinding of voluntary supply cuts, citing a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals. The move comes after the alliance had already tripled its monthly production hikes from May to July. This increase aims to balance the market amid seasonal demand and recent geopolitical tensions that briefly boosted oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study from researchers in China indicates that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have cancer-fighting properties. The research suggests the drug can bolster the immune system by restoring the function of dendritic cells, which are crucial for identifying and attacking tumors but often become depleted as cancer progresses. By reversing this impairment, sildenafil could potentially serve as a new form of tumor immunotherapy. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, highlighting a promising new avenue for cancer treatment strategies.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena community showed overwhelming support for Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale vending business after she became fearful following a recent immigration raid in their area. Organized by a community activist, hundreds of customers lined up to buy out the family's entire stock, raising over $1,500 to help with bills and rent. The event highlights a trend of American-born children stepping up for their immigrant parents amid heightened fears of federal immigration enforcement actions. Chris expressed his gratitude, explaining he just wanted to help his mother.</p>

          <p>Hamas has provided a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, stating it is ready for immediate negotiations. However, the group has requested several changes, including a halt to a U.S.-backed aid system and a U.S. guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The 60-day proposed truce involves a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and increased aid to Gaza. This development has raised hopes for a potential deal, though Israel has not yet commented publicly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the changing perceptions of showing emotion, specifically crying, in the workplace, prompted by a recent public display by a UK politician. It features anecdotes from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues. Career coaches and experts argue that the old-school idea of leaving emotions at the door is outdated and that emotional intelligence is now seen as a strength. They suggest that compassionate employers who support staff through emotional moments are more likely to foster a motivated and productive workforce.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has established himself as a pivotal player in the Trump administration, notably by helping to push a massive tax and spending bill through Congress. He was instrumental in negotiating with holdouts in both the Senate and the House, casting tie-breaking votes and acting as a direct line to the president. Beyond domestic policy, Vance has also become a key defender of Trump's foreign policy, including the controversial decision to strike Iran. His active and influential role aligns with the expectation that he would serve as Trump's "eyes and ears" and is fueling speculation about his future presidential ambitions.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans into some of its credit score models this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of these installment payment services, especially among younger and lower-income consumers. For lenders, this provides a more complete financial picture of potential borrowers, while for consumers, it means their BNPL payment history can now affect their creditworthiness. Making timely payments could help build a positive credit history, but missed payments could negatively impact one's score, introducing a new risk factor.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's accelerating integration into mainstream finance, with major institutions building on its infrastructure. Companies like Robinhood are now offering tokenized U.S. stocks on Ethereum-based networks, and Deutsche Bank is developing a tokenization platform on it. This shift is driven by Ethereum's reputation for stability, security, and decentralization, which institutions increasingly value for handling financial transactions. Despite competition from faster blockchains, Ethereum is solidifying its role as the trusted back-end for the future of tokenized assets and global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, a breakthrough for the industry. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The floating panels are more efficient due to the cooling effect of the water's surface. This development marks a key milestone in tapping the ocean for renewable energy and is part of China's broader efforts to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>In the wake of U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a "new international agreement" to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating tensions and advocated for placing Iran's nuclear activities under strict international supervision. This diplomatic push positions China, a key ally of Tehran, as a potential mediator and responsible global power. The call for a new deal underscores Beijing's effort to de-escalate the conflict and find a long-term solution to the regional instability.</p>

          <p>The article explores the long-standing scientific debate over whether culture shapes visual perception, highlighting two recent studies with conflicting findings. One study found that people from rural Namibia perceive an illusion differently than those in the US/UK, supporting the "carpentered world" hypothesis. However, another study convincingly debunks this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it even works on animals and the newly sighted. The author suggests that perception is an active construction by the brain, meaning we all live in unique "perceptual echo chambers," which calls for humility about our own experiences.</p>

The reopening follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve water quality, which included building a large underground storage tank to prevent sewage overflow.

          <p>Sweden, the country that originated the "flight shaming" movement, has abolished its air passenger tax in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy. The tax, introduced in 2018, contributed to a significant drop in air travel and a shift toward rail, but also negatively impacted regional connectivity and growth. The reversal by the right-wing government highlights the tension between environmental policies and economic concerns, with airlines already announcing new routes in response. The move is seen as a blow by environmentalists but is being closely watched by other European nations that have implemented similar aviation taxes.</p>

The fans, many of whom are from the Latino community directly affected by the raids, felt the team had abandoned them by not issuing a statement of support.
