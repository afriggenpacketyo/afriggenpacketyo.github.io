          <p>Japan and the United States are engaged in ongoing tariff negotiations, though they have "yet to find common ground," according to Tokyo's top negotiator. Both countries aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement by mid-June, with discussions covering trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. Japan is seeking the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, arguing that these measures negatively impact the Japanese economy. Prime Minister Ishiba emphasized the importance of protecting national interests during these intensive talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., is hosting WorldPride 2025, culminating in a weekend parade that begins in a historic gay neighborhood and concludes at the U.S. Capitol. This marks the first time D.C. has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its inception in 2000, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Pride events in the city. Despite the usual scale of Pride festivities, organizers acknowledge that the current political climate, including executive orders limiting trans rights, has tempered excitement. High-profile corporate sponsors have also declined to support the event due to executive orders targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 recently achieved a historical milestone, gaining at least 5% in May, which has occurred only seven times in the past 75 years. Historical data indicates that the S&P 500 has been higher 100% of the time one year after such an advance in May, with an average annual return of 19.9%. Despite ongoing volatility-inducing factors like tariff policies and high equity valuations, this historical correlation suggests a positive outlook for the stock market over the next year. Investors are encouraged to remain optimistic and rely on time as an ally, given that bull markets tend to last significantly longer than bear markets. (not investment advice)</p>

While a recalibration is anticipated, observers expect continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan.
