          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism around U.S. crypto regulation. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have also contributed to the rally. Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows, and the number of bitcoin held by public companies has grown significantly. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation have further supported the market.</p>

          <p>Svetlana Dali has been found guilty of stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris. Dali, a Russian citizen and U.S. permanent resident, boarded the flight without a ticket by passing through security in a lane reserved for crewmembers and blending in with boarding passengers. She admitted to staying in the bathroom for most of the flight. After being sent back to the United States, Dali cut off her ankle monitor and attempted to cross into Canada. The TSA has conducted a review and implemented additional security measures in response to the incident.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has signed a deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base for ¬£101m a year. The prime minister said the deal was the only way to maintain the base's long-term future and strengthened the UK's national security. Under the terms of the agreement Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a military base on Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years. The Conservatives described the deal as "an act of national self-harm", which left the UK "more exposed to China" because of its ties with Mauritius.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Department Plans to Phase Out the Penny</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department said it plans to stop manufacturing the penny, calling time on one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government. The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out. Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday. The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth.</p>
