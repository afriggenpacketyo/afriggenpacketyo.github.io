South Korea's Kospi recovered from a previous fall, while Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight dip after hitting a record high.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a decline following the resumption of crude exports from Kurdistan and plans by OPEC+ to increase output. These developments signal a potential rise in global oil supply, which typically puts downward pressure on prices, impacting energy markets worldwide. The market reacted to the dual factors of increased regional supply and broader organizational decisions impacting production levels. This shift reflects complex geopolitical and economic forces at play within the international energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations for green marine fuels, particularly methanol, depend heavily on establishing a reliable supply chain, according to CM Energy president Wang Yongxin. While the city has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, it needs to develop infrastructure for mainland-produced, tax-free methanol. The company's new dual-fuel vessel, CM Hong Kong, demonstrates the transition, with plans to increase green methanol usage from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions tariffs.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its windmills, will introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This measure aims to control overtourism, as the small village with only 100 residents hosted 2.6 million visitors last year, leading to privacy infringements for residents. The fee will include museum and windmill access, with revenues intended for maintenance and infrastructure. Local businesses, however, fear a significant loss of shoppers due to the increased cost for families.</p>
