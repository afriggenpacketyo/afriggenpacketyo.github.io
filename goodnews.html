          <p>The Labour Party is attempting to move past a misstep concerning winter fuel payments, which initially limited the benefit to pensioners receiving pension credit or other means-tested support. This policy change led to significant criticism and complaints from Labour MPs and the public. The government has since reversed course in three stages, expanding eligibility for the payment. Some suggest the initial decision reflected genuine concerns about the state of public finances, while others believe the issue could have been handled more effectively from the outset.</p>
