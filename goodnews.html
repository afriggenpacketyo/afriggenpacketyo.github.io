          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 07:04:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaches a one-year low, experts suggest several ways for potential homebuyers to obtain better loan terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and maintaining low credit utilization, which can significantly lower interest payments over the life of a loan. Additionally, providing a larger down payment and considering alternatives to a traditional 30-year fixed mortgage, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), can also help secure a more favorable rate from lenders.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit highlights this strategy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy. Experts suggest that while India is not abandoning its crucial relationship with the U.S., it is hedging its bets to navigate an increasingly volatile global order and leverage its position among competing power blocs.</p>

          <p>A long-running succession battle within the Murdoch family has concluded with a deal that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the conservative media empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the agreement, Lachlan will control a new trust, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with shares in Fox or News Corp. The three siblings are set to sell their holdings and will receive approximately $1.1 billion each, ensuring the media conglomerate's conservative direction after Rupert Murdoch's death.</p>

          <p>In an era of political attacks on diversity initiatives and elite universities, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are experiencing a surge in applications. According to Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, Black students are increasingly seeking out HBCUs as affirming communities where their history and identity are valued rather than erased. While this trend is positive, she notes that a major challenge for these institutions is having sufficient financial aid to support the growing number of applicants in need.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his book "Raising A Nation," researcher Elliot Haspel argues that advocates for affordable child care should reframe the issue as a fundamental American value rather than just an economic necessity for working parents. He contends that treating child care as a public good, similar to K-12 education, carries greater moral weight and is essential for family well-being, community stability, and even national security. This approach, he believes, is necessary to build the broad political consensus needed for transformative federal investment in a national child-care system.</p>
