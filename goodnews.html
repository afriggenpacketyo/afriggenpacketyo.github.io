          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey property. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted area. This was one of five unauthorized airspace incursions that occurred over the weekend, prompting NORAD to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restrictions before takeoff. Officials emphasized that such protocols are mandatory for flight safety and that the flares used pose no danger to people on the ground.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report explores the rising trend of egg freezing, a procedure increasingly seen by women as a form of insurance to preserve fertility options for the future. While doctors describe it as revolutionary, comparing its impact to the birth control pill, they also caution that it is not a guarantee of a future baby, with success rates diminishing at each step of the process. The procedure is also financially prohibitive for many, with a single cycle costing over $12,000 and many women needing multiple rounds. The article details the medical process, the motivations of women who choose it, and the ethical debates surrounding the practice.</p>

          <p>In a 60 Minutes interview, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis expressed profound optimism about the future of artificial intelligence, suggesting it could lead to the end of all disease within a decade. Hassabis, a recent Nobel laureate, believes advanced AI will revolutionize drug discovery and solve humanity's most complex problems, potentially creating an era of "radical abundance." He also acknowledged the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of maintaining control over increasingly autonomous systems. The report showcased DeepMind's latest AI, Astra, which can see, hear, and reason about the world in real time.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the minor quake, which caused brief shaking and confusion for some residents but resulted in no reported injuries or significant damage. While relatively rare for the region, the event follows a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in the same area in April 2024. Officials and analysts reassured the public that a quake of this size is not considered significant and widespread damage would not be expected.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport shortly after takeoff due to an engine failure. The pilot of the Boeing 787 declared a mayday emergency after the left engine failed as the aircraft was ascending. According to audio recordings, air traffic control cleared a path for the plane to return safely to the airport. All 219 passengers and 11 crew members deplaned without injury, and the airline confirmed the diversion was due to a "mechanical issue." The flight was subsequently canceled, and passengers were rebooked on alternate flights.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this represented a steep 66% drop from its impressive debut, a larger decline than Marvel's previous film, "Thunderbolts." The weekend's new releases, the animated sequel "The Bad Guys 2" and the comedy reboot "The Naked Gun," took the second and third spots with $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Analysts noted that while the summer box office started strong, its overall success will now depend on the sustained performance of upcoming films.</p>

          <h2>Apple Reportedly Considers Major AI Acquisition to Accelerate Development</h2>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has signaled a potential shift in strategy, suggesting the company might pursue a major acquisition to accelerate its artificial intelligence roadmap. This has fueled speculation that Apple could be interested in acquiring AI chatbot company Perplexity, which has over 22 million monthly users and a rapidly growing revenue stream. Perplexity's focus on providing direct, real-time answers with cited sources aligns with Apple's user-experience-centric philosophy. Such a deal would be a significant departure from Apple's usual practice of smaller, bolt-on acquisitions and would instantly bolster its position in the competitive AI landscape.

          <h2>Florida Overtakes California in Utility-Scale Solar Energy Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, Florida added more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, positioning it as a new leader in the nation's solar energy boom. This growth is primarily driven by utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are taking advantage of streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the falling cost of solar power. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations. Despite this, large-scale projects continue as solar becomes economically competitive with natural gas, even without subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The test cricket match between England and India at The Oval is set for a tense conclusion, with the outcome hanging in the balance. England needs just 35 more runs to secure a historic series victory, while India needs to take four more wickets. The match has been marked by dramatic shifts in momentum, including contrasting centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root that put their team in a winning position. However, a late surge from India's bowlers and the intervention of bad weather has left the result on a knife's edge, promising a thrilling final morning of play.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a recent offensive slump to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on situational hitting and aggressive baserunning rather than power. After being shut out for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through timely singles, walks, and a key double-steal. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning record on their nine-game road trip. The team continues to experiment with its lineup, including moving Mookie Betts to the two-hole, as they search for ways to spark their underperforming offense.</p>
