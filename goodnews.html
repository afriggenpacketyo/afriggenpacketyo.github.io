          <p>A federal judge has overturned a Trump administration order that had stopped construction on the Revolution Wind project off the New England coast. The Danish company Orsted will resume work on the nearly completed farm, which is expected to power over 350,000 homes. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable, creating a contentious environment for renewable energy projects.</p>

This new entity would feature a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle managing top-to-bottom security, including oversight of the app's powerful algorithm. While the administration expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, Beijing has not publicly confirmed the deal, leaving the future of the popular social media app's 170 million U.S. users pending final agreements.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates on a downward trend and the possibility of another Federal Reserve rate cut in October, prospective homebuyers are advised to prepare strategically. Key steps include getting a mortgage pre-approval after checking one's credit report to demonstrate financial readiness to sellers. Additionally, researching and selecting an experienced real estate agent can provide a competitive edge in a potentially more crowded market. Comparing lenders and their terms now will also position buyers to act quickly and effectively when rates drop. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. For a $100,000 loan, current estimates place the monthly payment at approximately $1,236 for a 10-year term and $974 for a 15-year term, reflecting a modest decrease from earlier in the year. With home equity levels at a record high, these loans remain an accessible option, and further anticipated rate cuts could lead to additional savings for borrowers in the near future.

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has voiced his frustration with the Premier League's scheduling, claiming it gave Arsenal an unfair advantage in their recent match. City had only 66 hours to recover after a Champions League game before facing Arsenal, who had an extra two days of rest. Silva argued that playing such a high-stakes game with a significant rest disadvantage is not right and affects players' ability to perform at their best, echoing previous complaints from manager Pep Guardiola about the demanding schedule for English teams in European competitions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As fall begins, experts note that climate change is generally causing the season's vibrant leaf colors to appear later than they have historically. Warmer autumn temperatures delay the breakdown of chlorophyll, which is responsible for the green color in leaves, pushing peak foliage back by about a week compared to mid-20th century patterns. While online maps provide general predictions, local conditions like rainfall and elevation play a significant role, meaning the timing and intensity of fall colors can vary greatly from one location to another each year.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs not paid by Original Medicare, but premiums vary widely based on location, plan type, and personal factors.

To secure lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible to avoid penalties for pre-existing conditions and carefully comparing plans from different insurers. (not investment advice)</p>
