        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xpeng's Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a significant surge, climbing over 10% following the release of upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter, with analysts projecting profitability by the fourth quarter of 2025. The Guangzhou-based electric vehicle manufacturer reported a doubling of first-quarter revenue, driven by robust sales, and a narrowed net loss compared to the previous year, alongside an improved gross margin. Analysts at UOB Kay Hian maintain a buy rating on the stock, anticipating a strong product cycle to continue driving sales and projecting a target price with substantial upside from its current level. The company has been working on expanding overseas.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers, channeling the spirit of Reggie Miller, mounted an improbable comeback to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers in the fourth quarter ignited the Pacers' rally from a 17-point deficit, while Tyrese Haliburton's buzzer-beater sent the game into overtime. Despite Jalen Brunson's 43 points, the Knicks couldn't hold off the Pacers, who secured their first lead since the second quarter with a late 5-0 run. The Knicks are hoping to win the series, as they previously did in the series where Miller hit them with his choke signal.</p>

          <p>Teoscar Hernández delivered a crucial three-run home run in the sixth inning, propelling the Dodgers to a 3-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. After Dodgers manager Dave Roberts strategically rested Hernández the previous day to ensure his availability against Corbin Burnes, Hernández's clutch hit broke a scoreless tie and secured the win. Dustin May pitched a strong six innings, allowing only one run, while the Dodgers' bullpen, including Lou Trivino and Tanner Scott, held off the Diamondbacks' offense.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that Canada is engaged in high-level discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. The multilayered system, estimated to cost $175 billion, aims to defend against a wide range of missile threats. Carney emphasized the importance of protections for Canadians and acknowledged the potential for Canada to contribute to the program.

          <p>The House Rules Committee advanced a revised version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to the full House after making changes to provisions related to Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. The bill, which supports President Trump's second-term agenda, now includes a December 2026 start date for Medicaid work requirements and raises the SALT deduction to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000. The amendment also renames MAGA Accounts to "Trump" Accounts and expedites cuts to clean energy credits.

          <p>New research suggests that Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, was once 2 to 2.5 times its current volume, with a significantly more powerful magnetic field. Scientists Konstantin Batygin and Fred Adams analyzed the orbital motions of Jupiter's moons, Amalthea and Thebe, to reconstruct the planet's early evolution. Their findings support the bottom-up method of planet formation, indicating a period of rapid, intense growth early in the solar system's history. This research provides valuable insights into Jupiter's role in stabilizing the planets and enabling life to emerge on Earth.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed a bill to provide $1,000 to every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, in accounts initially dubbed "MAGA accounts" but later renamed "Trump accounts." The funds would be invested on the child's behalf and could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. Tax experts have noted that the accounts would function similarly to typical investment accounts, with post-tax contributions and taxed gains upon withdrawal, rather than offering tax advantages like retirement or health savings accounts.</p>

This action highlights the EU's commitment to maintaining the network's operations amid the Trump administration's efforts to undermine its finances and independence.

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers before the upcoming House of Councillors election. The new scheme, which replaces a previous one that capped prices at 185 yen per liter, provides a fixed sum regardless of prices. The government subsidy intends to decrease the wholesale gasoline price gradually, with a targeted reduction of 10 yen by mid-June.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, with a dented confidence in U.S. assets further fueling bullishness for emerging markets.
