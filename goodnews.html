          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) attempted to embed a team within the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent legislative watchdog, but was rejected. The GAO cited its status as a legislative branch entity not subject to presidential executive orders. This request, referencing President Trump's executive order creating DOGE, was viewed by some as an intrusion on the separation of powers. DOGE has also approached privately incorporated nonprofits and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, facing similar rejections, highlighting concerns over executive branch overreach.</p>

          <p>As pressure mounts to eliminate artificial food coloring in the United States, companies are exploring natural alternatives derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers, and even insects. The shift follows health concerns and regulatory actions, including a plan to encourage food companies to voluntarily remove artificial colors by 2026. However, transitioning to natural colors poses challenges, including supply limitations, color stability issues, and higher costs. Despite these hurdles, companies like PepsiCo and WK Kellogg are accelerating the shift toward natural colors in their products.</p>

This move aligns with the Trump administration's push for cost cuts across civil service agencies. The central bank had just under 24,000 employees in 2023, so a 10% reduction would bring that number below 22,000.</p>
