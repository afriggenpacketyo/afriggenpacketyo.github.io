          <p>Shares of the financial services platform Robinhood reached an all-time high, marking a more than 160% increase this year, despite facing multiple significant challenges. The company is under investigation by Florida's Attorney General for allegedly deceptive marketing regarding its crypto trading costs. Additionally, Robinhood faces user backlash over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and public objections from OpenAI regarding its tokenized stock offerings in Europe. These obstacles highlight the growing regulatory and operational pressures on the fintech firm even as its market valuation soars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of "loyal wingman" technology by conducting advanced coordination tests between crewed fighter jets and uncrewed drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15E each controlled two semi-autonomous XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time integration in a simulated combat environment. This initiative is part of a broader strategy by the U.S. Air Force to achieve air supremacy through seamless collaboration between human pilots and AI-driven aircraft. The developments are seen as a key part of the technological race for air dominance with nations like China.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a statue of Robert Smalls, marking the first time a Black man has been honored with a monument at this location. Smalls was a formerly enslaved man who became a celebrated Civil War hero and later a U.S. Congressman. His statue will join those of several white historical figures, many of whom have connections to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. This move represents a significant step in diversifying the historical narratives represented at the state's seat of government.</p>

          <p>A growing number of individuals are using AI-driven dating assistants to improve their chances of finding a partner, with a recent study showing one in four singles now use such tools. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer services that help users craft witty opening messages, suggest replies to keep conversations flowing, and even navigate difficult situations like being "ghosted." While some users find the technology to be a valuable confidence booster and conversation starter, its rising popularity also sparks debate about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest these tools can be helpful as long as they supplement, rather than substitute, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached the Wimbledon final, marking a remarkable comeback just two years after stepping away from the sport due to burnout and mental health struggles.

During her time off, she lived a more normal life and did not touch a racket for months, defying warnings that she might never return to top form. Her successful return to the highest level of tennis is a powerful story of prioritizing personal well-being.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high on Friday, briefly trading above $118,000 before settling slightly lower. This significant rally was primarily driven by a massive influx of institutional capital into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The upward price movement was further amplified by a wave of short liquidations and broader market optimism that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates. This price action continues a powerful trend of institutional investment pouring into the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media giant intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit its younger users for commercial gain. The state's Attorney General argues these features are designed to keep children engaged on the app longer, exposing them to more ads and prompting purchases. The judge ruled the state's claims were not about user-generated content, which is federally protected, but about the app's allegedly dangerous design features.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations following incidents where reporters were allegedly targeted and injured by police while covering demonstrations against immigration policies. The judge's order states that police cannot use these weapons "against journalists who are not posing a threat of imminent harm." The decision was praised by free press advocates as a necessary step to protect constitutional rights.</p>
