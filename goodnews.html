          <p>New York City beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, an increase from last year but still short of the required 1,400. Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue anticipates staffing will increase as students finish classes, with 374 new lifeguards in training and returning lifeguards expected. The city has increased hourly wages and offered signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards, and lifeguard stations have been upgraded. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards present, though some have grown accustomed to being more vigilant due to past shortages, and city officials are emphasizing the importance of water safety.

          <p>Young US men are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, unapologetic masculinity, with a priest named Father Moses McPherson championing a form of traditional manliness. Many converts feel modern society is harsh on men and are drawn to the church's conservative values, including prioritizing family over career for women. While the number of Christian Orthodox is small compared to evangelical megachurches, this trend reflects broader political shifts and the digital space plays a key role in attracting new converts. Some converts hold unconventional views, seeing the Russian Church as a rigid, disciplinary, and authoritarian religion. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Sam Fender closed out Saturday at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool with a performance featuring hits like Seventeen Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles. The singer told the crowd he was nervous, and the set had some technical issues. Ed Sheeran made a surprise appearance on the New Music Stage, and other performers included Sugababes, Blossoms, and Wolf Alice. More than 100,000 fans are expected to attend the festival. The optimism score is 85.</p>
