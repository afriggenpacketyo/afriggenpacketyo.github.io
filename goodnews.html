          <p>Google is implementing stricter limitations on its 'Work from Anywhere' (WFA) policy, which was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees can now only work remotely outside of their main office for up to four weeks per year, and even a single day of remote work will count as a full week against their allowance. The company is not changing its hybrid schedule, which allows employees to work from home two days a week, but WFA days cannot be used for working from home. Google has also started offering voluntary buyouts to some U.S. employees and has warned remote workers that their jobs may be at risk if they do not return to the office on a hybrid schedule. These changes reflect a broader trend among tech companies to encourage employees to spend more time in the office.</p>

Despite these efforts to diversify, gambling revenue remains a significant contributor to Macao's economy, driving profits and tax revenue, while the events are driving the gambling. </p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal involving the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian detainees, leading to celebrations in Gaza and Tel Aviv. The agreement, facilitated by President Trump, aims to end the war and allow for Israel's withdrawal from parts of Gaza, along with the entry of humanitarian aid. The deal includes the release of all remaining hostages and a significant number of Palestinian prisoners, with a surge of aid expected to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Despite the celebrations, uncertainties remain regarding the long-term governance of Gaza and the implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement.</p>

Premium travel continues to outperform the coach cabin, with revenue from high-end segments increasing, and the airline expects positive domestic unit revenue growth in the current quarter, driven by strong corporate travel demand.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' forecasts, driven by international growth that offset declining volume in North America. The company's worldwide volume for both food and drinks fell 1% during the quarter, but the company is shifting to smaller packaging sizes to appeal to price-conscious consumers. The company is also focusing on cost-cutting measures, as well as shifting to more 'permissible' snack offerings, and improving the performance of the North American food segment is a top priority. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has taken a $4 billion stake in Pepsi, pushing for changes including refranchising its North American bottling network.</p>

          <p>All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers, according to a government announcement. This change aims to improve the size of payouts for victims affected by the faulty Horizon computer system, which led to the prosecution of over 900 sub-postmasters. The government has accepted most recommendations from the public inquiry into the scandal, and victims can now access government-funded legal advice to decide whether to accept fixed-sum offers. The government has also committed to setting up a new appeals process for postmasters who accepted a fixed payout, ensuring victims receive fair redress.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is expected to be announced in October, but a federal government shutdown may delay the release of the data. Experts estimate the benefit increase will be around 2.7% to 2.8%, based on consumer price index data. The shutdown may postpone the release of CPI data, affecting the COLA announcement, and Medicare Part B premiums may also impact the amount beneficiaries receive. Despite potential delays, the COLA is projected to provide a boost to millions of Social Security recipients facing higher prices for necessities. (not investment advice)</p>

While Kazakhstan is cooperating with China on trade digitization, obstacles remain due to differing customs and logistics procedures. Trade volumes along the Middle Corridor are expected to triple by 2030, driven largely by Kazakhstan's exports.
