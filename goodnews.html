          <p>Experts at the GITEX Asia 2025 conference discussed the potential for AI to exacerbate inequality in the workplace, with some suggesting companies should focus on upskilling employees and creating new employment opportunities. Others argued that protecting existing employment may not be the right approach and that adapting to the changing landscape is crucial. The Microsoft Trend Index indicates that many leaders are confident in using AI to expand workforce capacity but are also considering headcount reductions. Ethical considerations, such as managing bias in AI data, were also highlighted as important aspects to address. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its in-house beagle laboratory following scrutiny over its experimentation practices. A report detailed allegations of the lab pumping pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and forcing them into septic shock. The White Coat Waste project and PETA praised the closure, while PETA highlighted Anthony Fauci's alleged approval of funding for similar tests in Tunisia. The NIH director received flowers from PETA after the closure. Envigo, the company that bred the beagles, pleaded guilty to neglecting thousands of dogs and will pay fines.</p>

          <p>Following the Miami Grand Prix, McLaren team principal Andrea Stella suggested that Lando Norris could have been more patient in his approach to racing Max Verstappen. Norris passed Verstappen off-track and had to cede the position before regaining it. Stella saw no difference in how Norris and Piastri approached racing Verstappen, emphasizing the fine margins involved. Norris closed on Piastri after passing Verstappen but ran out of time to close the gap.</p>

          <p>The Royal Family hopes nothing distracts from VE Day commemorations this week, which fall days after Prince Harry's interview. Events begin on Monday with a military procession through central London after which members of the Royal Family will appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony. The King and Queen are looking forward to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe and the end to World War Two. This years' VE Day commemorations are the first to take place without any of the royals who were present 80 years ago.</p>
