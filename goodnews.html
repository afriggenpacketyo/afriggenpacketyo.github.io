          <p>As the Scottish National Party (SNP) prepares for its annual conference, First Minister John Swinney is focused on stabilizing the party and sharpening its strategy for the upcoming Holyrood election. After a period of turmoil following the successive resignations of his predecessors, Swinney has steadied the party by addressing internal controversies and focusing on public service delivery. While the path to Scottish independence remains a central, albeit challenging, issue for the party, recent polls suggest the SNP holds a lead over a slumping Labour party. The conference will be a key opportunity for Swinney to define his leadership and outline his vision for Scotland.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children, displaced by the war, have been reunited with their families following what she described as an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. She stated that Putin responded to a "peace letter" she sent concerning the plight of children affected by the conflict, which was hand-delivered in August. The reunification was reportedly facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine, with the U.S. government confirming the details. This development is part of her ongoing BE BEST initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children globally.</p>

          <p>The Chinese central government has issued guidelines warning local authorities not to provide artificial intelligence systems with access to sensitive information or state secrets. The new rules outline approved uses for AI in governance, such as answering public queries, monitoring infrastructure with drones, and assisting with administrative tasks like drafting documents. However, the document emphasizes that a thorough safety evaluation must be conducted before any AI model is deployed for government use. The initiative aims to improve government efficiency while safeguarding national security as AI integration expands.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Florida Atlantic University have developed a method to make hardwood more durable by infusing it with an iron compound, a breakthrough that could revolutionize the construction industry. By introducing nanocrystalline iron oxyhydroxide into red oak, scientists significantly increased the wood's strength with minimal added weight. This innovation presents a promising, eco-friendly alternative to conventional building materials like concrete and steel, which have large carbon footprints. The strengthened bio-based material could pave the way for more sustainable large-scale infrastructure and help reduce global carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are increasing their investment in Africa to address the continent's significant medicine manufacturing deficit, as part of China's "health silk road" initiative. Projects include a new facility in Nigeria to produce Chinese-made insulin and a multi-phase plant by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical in the Ivory Coast to manufacture antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. Africa currently imports the vast majority of its essential medicines and vaccines, creating a high-demand market for generic medications. These developments aim to bolster local production capabilities and improve healthcare access across the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German lawmakers are debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as "catcalling," which is not currently covered under the country's sexual offenses or insult laws. The Social Democrats are pushing for a change, arguing that such behavior intimidates victims and should be legally punishable, closing what they see as a loophole. While some politicians and legal experts question whether new legislation is the most effective approach, citing implementation challenges, other European countries have already passed similar laws. The debate has been propelled by youth-led activism and petitions demanding greater protection in public spaces.</p>
