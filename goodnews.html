          <h2>U.S. Suspends Live Cattle Imports from Mexico Due to Screwworm Detection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 19:38:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has temporarily halted the importation of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports to address the detection of screwworm, a potentially fatal parasite, in farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the importance of animal and food supply safety, stating the suspension is not politically motivated but focused on implementing increased surveillance and eradication efforts. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu√© expressed disagreement but remained confident in reaching an agreement soon. The screwworm, a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, can severely damage tissues and cause fatal lesions in warm-blooded animals, including humans.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Explore Restoring Bodily Functions After Spinal Cord Injuries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at NeuroRestore in Switzerland are developing a 'digital bridge' to help paralyzed individuals regain movement and bodily functions. The technology involves wirelessly transmitting signals from the brain to the spinal cord, bypassing the injury. While walking is often seen as the top priority, patients express greater interest in regaining control over functions like bladder control, blood pressure regulation, and sexual function. Spinal cord stimulation also shows promise in improving mobility for individuals with Parkinson's disease, and researchers are working to simplify the therapy for broader accessibility.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. The artifact, designated as a cultural asset, will be stored at a museum following a ceremony. South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023 after a lawsuit from a South Korean temple claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.</p>

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a 2018 bike accident, has regained the ability to walk with the aid of a 'digital bridge,' a technology connecting a brain implant to a spinal cord stimulator. This allows her to move her legs using her thoughts, and she describes it as gaining a superpower. The technology, developed by Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and Gregoire Courtine, aims to bypass spinal cord injuries by creating a direct digital connection between the brain and the region of the spinal cord that controls movement. The digital bridge has also helped others regain arm movement.</p>

Temperatures will drop more than 20 degrees, with highs along the beaches in the mid-60s and in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys around 70 degrees. A heavy marine layer will bring low clouds and drizzle to the coast and into the mountains, with 'May gray' conditions expected to set in.
