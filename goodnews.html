          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed concern over potentially losing access to China's rapidly growing AI market, which is projected to reach $50 billion in the next few years, stating it would be a 'tremendous loss' for the company. Huang emphasized that selling to China would boost revenue in the U.S., contributing to taxes and job creation. These remarks come as Nvidia navigates tightening U.S. export controls, which now include their China-tailored H20 AI chips used by major tech firms like Tencent and ByteDance. Nvidia seeks to maintain its presence in China, which accounted for approximately 14% of its revenue last financial year.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a week, a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet went overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman, this time after an arrestment failure during landing in the Red Sea. Both pilots ejected safely and sustained minor injuries; no flight deck personnel were harmed. The warplane was lost into the sea and has not been recovered. This incident follows another F/A-18F Super Hornet loss where the aircraft went overboard while being towed in a hangar bay due to crew losing control. The Harry S.

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of 'modern-day appeasement' towards Russia, particularly regarding Trump's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden expressed concerns that Europe might lose confidence in American leadership under Trump, potentially altering the course of modern history. He condemned Trump's remarks about reclaiming the Panama Canal and annexing Greenland, deeming them uncharacteristic of American values. Biden defended his administration's actions in providing Ukraine with the necessary support for its independence and emphasized the readiness to respond more aggressively if Putin escalated further.</p>

          <p>Seagate, a data storage firm, is working towards developing a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030, driven by significant demand from data centers fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence.

The company's largest hard disk drive currently is 36-terabyte.

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced sweeping policy measures, including interest rate cuts and reductions in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), in an effort to stimulate economic growth amid ongoing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and reduce the RRR by 50 basis points, injecting liquidity into the market. Additional measures include supporting financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, and establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk reported a higher-than-expected net profit for the first quarter but has lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to lower-than-anticipated sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug. While the company's net profit exceeded expectations at 29.03 billion Danish kroner, Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst predictions, hitting 17.36 billion Danish kroner. Consequently, Novo Nordisk now projects sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. This adjustment comes amidst increasing competition in the weight loss drug market and follows disappointing trial results for its next-generation obesity drug candidate, CagriSema.</p>

While the dollar's reserve-currency status does play a role in trade deficits, it is just one of many factors. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. He also highlights the strength of the American economy as a key factor attracting investors, even in manufacturing, which has grown as a share of GDP.</p>
