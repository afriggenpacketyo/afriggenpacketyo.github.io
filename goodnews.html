          <p>The article reports that the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel is facing political tensions, particularly due to Israel's participation. Protests involving Palestinian flags and accusations of complicity in genocide occurred during the opening ceremony, with some booing the Israeli artist. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has implemented a code of conduct to prevent political statements, but some former participants and musicians have called for Israel's exclusion, citing double standards compared to Russia's ban in 2022. Other controversies include complaints about an Estonian rapper's song and adjustments to staging and song titles due to sexual connotations, all amid the usual speculation about front-runners and potential winners.</p>

          <p>According to the article, Erling Haaland has described Manchester City's season as "horrific" and "boring" due to the number of games they have lost. Despite this, the team has reached the FA Cup final and is close to qualifying for the Champions League. Haaland, who recently recovered from an ankle injury, emphasized the importance of winning the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace at Wembley to end the season on a positive note. He highlighted the good habit of reaching Wembley and the significance of winning trophies, noting that reaching the FA Cup final in a challenging season is a testament to the team's capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing the release of stockpiled rice to about 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices, which have been near record highs due to a supply shortfall. The government plans to release an additional 300,000 tons over three months through July, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This action would reduce the government's rice reserves to approximately 300,000 tons, raising concerns about the ability to respond to future poor harvests or natural disasters. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first three months of 2025, surpassing analyst expectations of 0.6%, according to official figures.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK economy grew faster than the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during this period. However, analysts cautioned that this strong growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming import tariffs and employer tax increases implemented in April.</p>

          <p>Three Maori MPs in New Zealand are facing suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers. The MPs were protesting a controversial bill to redefine the country's founding treaty. The Maori Party has criticized the recommendations as a "warning shot to all of us to fall in line". Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who is Maori, has called the trio "out-of-control MPs who flout the rules and intimidate others with outrageous hakas".</p>

          <p>The article explores the potential benefits of nature in aiding recovery from physical injuries, citing personal experiences and scientific research. Sarah Allely, who suffered a brain injury, found relief from headaches by spending time in nature. Studies suggest that time in nature can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and may also help with physical pain and brain injury rehabilitation. Experts explain that nature provides a "softer" form of attention that requires fewer mental resources, allowing the brain to restore and promoting emotional well-being, which can positively impact physical recovery.</p>

          <p>A medieval text held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, once believed to be a copy, has been identified as one of seven original versions of the Magna Carta dating from 1300. Two British academics discovered the manuscript, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, is an authentic 1300 version issued by King Edward I. The document, which binds rulers to act within the law, resurfaced at a time when Harvard faces pressure from the Trump administration. Researchers authenticated the text using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, comparing it with six other known originals from 1300.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Denmark's economic growth, which has been driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate in the coming years, it notes that the country is largely protected from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. This is because Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system where most of the value is in intellectual property, and manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF predicts medium-term growth of around 1.5% due to a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

This is a recurring theme, with Betts consistently making teams regret their decision to avoid pitching to Ohtani. The Athletics' decision to intentionally walk Ohtani to face Betts backfired as Betts delivered a clutch hit. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the logic behind the strategy but noted that Betts seems to thrive when taking things personally. This article discusses that the Dodgers received contributions from multiple players, including Ohtani, Andy Pages, and Hyeseong Kim.</p>

          <p>Julius Randle scored 29 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 121-110 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 5, sending the Timberwolves to the Western Conference finals. Anthony Edwards added 22 points and 12 assists for the Wolves, who will face the Denver-Oklahoma City winner next. The Warriors played without Stephen Curry due to a hamstring strain. Brandin Podziemski had a playoff career-high 28 points for the Warriors, but the Timberwolves' collection of scorers proved too much for Golden State to handle.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has begun construction on its fifth terminal, which is expected to be operational in the mid-2030s. The new terminal will almost double the size of Changi Airport's existing area, allowing it to handle 140 million passengers per year. Airports in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions are poised to undergo extensive development, with combined investments of $240 billion for upgrading existing facilities and building new airports between 2025 and 2035. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that with Terminal 5, Changi will aim to connect with 200 cities, up from the current 170 city links it has now.</p>
