          <h2>Zohran Mamdani's NYC Mayoral Primary Victory Attributed to Pro-Palestinian Activism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 08:00:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's surprising victory over Andrew Cuomo in New York City's mayoral Democratic primary is being analyzed as a significant political shift, largely credited to the grassroots Palestinian protest movement. The article suggests that Mamdani's unapologetic support for Palestinian liberation, once considered a political liability, resonated with a changing Democratic electorate, particularly younger voters. His campaign successfully mobilized organizers and activists from groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine. This win is seen as a sign that Palestine has become a central issue in domestic American politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is being interpreted as a potential harbinger of a "Tea Party" style populist revolt within the Democratic Party. The article points to widespread voter dissatisfaction with the party's establishment leadership and a desire for more aggressive, confrontational politics and generational change. Polling data indicates that Democratic voters, especially younger ones, feel leaders are out of touch with their economic concerns. This anti-establishment energy could lead to more primary challenges against incumbents, forcing a leftward shift in the party's priorities and tactics.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is an interracial coalition dedicated to confronting the region's history of racial violence by honoring Black victims of lynchings. The group recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and erecting memorials, the EKRP aims to ensure these forgotten atrocities are acknowledged and remembered. Their work is seen as especially relevant amid national debates over the teaching of Black history and racial justice.</p>

          <h2>Column Argues Pride Movement's Spirit Lies in Diversity, Not Respectability Politics</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques conservative gay figures who advocate for "respectability politics" by attempting to sideline more flamboyant or gender-nonconforming members of the LGBTQ+ community. The author argues that the true spirit of Pride is rooted in diversity and progress, not in trying to appeal to a mainstream audience by muting its most radical voices. Citing the historical role of drag queens and trans activists at Stonewall, the article asserts that the movement's strength has always come from its broad and inclusive coalition. It rejects the idea that any single group can define what it means to be "normal."</p>

          <p>This article revisits the wrongful murder conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther leader who spent 27 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. The case, which haunted his lawyer Johnnie Cochran, was built on the testimony of a police informant whose role was hidden by prosecutors and the FBI for decades. Pratt's conviction was eventually overturned in 1997 after evidence of a frame-up, part of the FBI's COINTELPRO program to neutralize Black leaders, came to light. The story reveals a "twilight zone of deceit" and official corruption used to imprison a man seen as a threat to the establishment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in the conservative stronghold of Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public library system from a MAGA-aligned city council. The initiatives rejected a parental review board for children's books and barred the privatization of the library, representing a significant rebuke of the council's conservative overreach. The successful grassroots campaign, "Protect HB," united residents across the political spectrum with a nonpartisan message focused on good government and community resources. Activists hope their victory can serve as a model for pushing back against extremist politics in other communities.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas on loan to a zoo in western Japan have departed for China, marking a significant moment in the two nations' "panda diplomacy." The female panda Rauhin and her three offspring left from Adventure World in Wakayama Prefecture, where the zoo has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China by next February. The event drew large crowds of visitors who came to bid the popular animals a final farewell.</p>

Writing from her hospital bed on social media, she urged other breastfeeding mothers to ensure they consume enough food and fluids, especially during the current summer heatwave. Johnson, who recently gave birth to her fourth child, thanked the NHS for their care during what she described as a "brutal" week. Her public message serves as a timely warning as heat health alerts are in effect across much of England amid soaring temperatures.</p>
