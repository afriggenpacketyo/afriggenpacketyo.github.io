          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced plans to ease prison overcrowding in the UK, including limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their licenses. Under the new measures, offenders recalled for license breaches will be released after a fixed 28-day period, bypassing lengthy parole board assessments. Mahmood warned that building new prisons alone would not solve the crisis, and that the change would not apply to those who commit serious further offenses or are deemed a high risk.</p>

          <p>A new Republican tax bill is facing criticism for potentially excluding millions of families from receiving the full child tax credit, even as conservatives promote policies aimed at encouraging larger families. One provision would raise the child tax credit to $2,500 per child, but an estimated 17 million children would be ineligible due to their parents' low income. Another provision would require parents to have a social security number to claim the credit, potentially impacting undocumented immigrants with U.S. citizen children.</p>

His appointment led to a shift in how Republican nominees were vetted, with a greater emphasis on ideological purity.

Provisional data from the CDC estimates that 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money.
