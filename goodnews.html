This marks the sixth time in the game's history the top prize has hit the billion-dollar mark, with an estimated cash value of $453.1 million. No one had won the jackpot since May 31, and if no grand prize winner emerged on Saturday, the prize will continue to increase for the next drawing. Four of the five previous billion-plus jackpots were won in California, including the record $2.04 billion in 2022.</p>

          <p>Iowa's head coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a significant milestone, tying Ohio State's Woody Hayes as the Big Ten’s all-time winningest coach with his 205th victory at the program. The Hawkeyes defeated Albany 34-7, with Xavier Williams rushing for 122 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his debut, contributed a passing and a rushing touchdown despite a slow start. Ferentz, now in his 27th season, humbly downplayed the personal achievement, emphasizing the team's win.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party is experiencing a surge in public favorability, now surpassing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in recent polls. Despite this, the KMT is grappling with internal anxiety over the succession of its chairman, Eric Chu Li-luan, who is stepping down in October. The role is seen as a 'poisoned chalice' amidst volatile political times, with the DPP's favorability dropping significantly and discontent reaching its highest recorded level for any major party.</p>

These 28 new trains, assembled in upstate New York, offer enhanced passenger comfort with upgraded seats, larger windows, faster Wi-Fi, and more charging options. Designed to lean into curves for increased speed on older tracks, they also incorporate stronger crashworthiness standards. The initiative aims to further boost Amtrak's market share in the Northeast Corridor and is seen as a significant step for high-speed rail in America.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a revered CBS News correspondent and an unofficial presidential historian, has passed away at 73 in Washington, D.C. Known for his meticulous record-keeping of every presidential action and utterance across eight administrations, Knoller filled a crucial void in American history. Despite working long hours, he generously shared his vast statistical knowledge with colleagues and historians. His career evolved from radio correspondent to a prominent Twitter (now X) presence, where he continued to share White House news and insights with a large following. Knoller was deeply admired for his dedication, kindness, and encyclopedic knowledge.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with overall beer sales reaching their lowest in over 30 years during the first half of 2025, down 6.3%. Conversely, sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013, indicating a growing preference among consumers. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting, with non-alcoholic options now comprising a quarter of their production, often promoted at sporting events as a healthier alternative. While full-strength beer remains popular at traditional festivals, a broader trend towards more conscious consumption is evident, particularly among younger generations.</p>

          <h2>Metal Gear Solid Returns with Remake Years After Creator Hideo Kojima's Departure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series makes a comeback with a remake of its third installment, 'Metal Gear Solid Delta,' a decade after its creator Hideo Kojima's acrimonious split from Konami. The series, known for pioneering cinematic gaming and tackling complex themes, was left directionless following Kojima's departure in 2015, reportedly due to spiraling development costs for 'Metal Gear Solid V.' The remake, however, is being praised by fans for its faithful recreation of the original, improved graphics, and audio, with many attributing its success to Kojima's enduring directorial 'genes' embedded in the source material.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' which combines elements of 'Love Island,' 'Married at First Sight,' and 'Survivor.' Couples meet briefly, are matched by experts, have a fake wedding, and then are marooned on a remote tropical island to test if love can flourish under extreme conditions. Contestants face challenges like mosquitoes, intense heat, limited clothing, and primitive facilities, aiming to build genuine connections stripped of superficiality. The show, featuring slightly older contestants, seeks to explore authentic relationships and the impact of adversity on budding romances.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs and drones, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest threatening the nation's forests. This beetle, which has ravaged European spruce trees, was found to be entering the UK via wind currents, not just imported wood. The Forestry Research team has successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England, but climate change poses an increasing threat as warmer, wetter winters and drier summers stress trees, making them more susceptible. The effort is crucial to protect the UK's valuable timber industry and ancient woodlands.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst plans to announce she will not seek reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official. Ernst, who was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran, won her second term in 2020. Her decision opens up a competitive Senate race, with Representative Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) already eyeing the seat. Ernst has held leadership positions and advocated for federal budget cuts, but also faced scrutiny over her vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth despite her record as a military sexual assault prevention advocate.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto is poised to present a new, pragmatic roadmap for global diplomacy, emphasizing cooperation over confrontation. In a world grappling with a dysfunctional international system, Indonesia's extensive relationships and position as an economic powerhouse, unaligned with any single ideological camp, offer a unique perspective. The article argues that Prabowo's philosophy of 'constructive pragmatism' could serve as a corrective model for a global community increasingly paralyzed by competing national agendas and vetoes within institutions like the United Nations. The world, it contends, needs a practical call to action.</p>

          <p>Costco is set to enforce a new policy on September 1, granting Executive Membership holders an exclusive shopping hour before general admission. This perk, which previously had a grace period, will now restrict entry to non-Executive members before 10 a.m. on weekdays and 9:30 a.m. on Saturdays. The company defends the controversial move as a reward for its most loyal members, who pay a higher annual fee. This change follows other recent shifts, including the transition from Pepsi to exclusively Coca-Cola products in Costco food courts, which has also divided shoppers.</p>

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping are seeking to mend their strained relationship at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, driven partly by the impact of US tariffs. With both nations facing economic pressures from Washington, a potential reset in ties is on the horizon, despite long-standing border disputes and mistrust. Experts suggest a stronger China-India relationship could reshape global trade flows and reduce dependence on the United States. While significant changes may take time, Modi's visit aims to repair animosity and signal India's strategic options beyond Western alliances.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's ambitious adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a decades-long dream for the acclaimed director. Funded by Netflix, the film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature, with del Toro emphasizing a focus on the creature's 'newborn' beauty rather than a mere accident victim. The movie is divided into three parts, offering perspectives from both Frankenstein and his creation, exploring themes of humanity and imperfection. Early reviews are mixed but largely positive, praising its epic scale, artistry, and emotional depth, while some note its length.</p>
