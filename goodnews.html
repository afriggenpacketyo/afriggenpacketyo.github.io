          <p>Sean Dickson guided Somerset to a dramatic quarter-final victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast tournament with a remarkable late-game performance. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson struck two sixes and a four to secure the win with just one ball to spare, finishing with an unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls. This thrilling conclusion overturned what seemed like a certain defeat, sending Somerset to a record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day and continuing the Bears' streak of last-eight losses.</p>

          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer, with hiding an 18th-century painting looted during World War II. The artwork, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was discovered after 80 years when Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing for Kadgien's home. The heir of the original Jewish Dutch owner has filed a legal claim to reclaim the painting, which is part of a broader effort to recover over a thousand works of art lost during the war.</p>

The brand's reputation for long-lasting engines and high-quality construction means these older cars can offer significant value, but their growing popularity suggests prices may soon rise, making now a good time for enthusiasts to purchase them.

          <p>Director Jim Jarmusch's film "Father Mother Sister Brother" has won the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. The runner-up Silver Lion was awarded to the docudrama "The Voice of Hind Rajab," a devastating film about an attempt to rescue a 6-year-old girl in Gaza. Several award winners, including the directors of both films, used their acceptance speeches to draw attention to the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, bringing a strong political tone to the prestigious awards ceremony.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Oliver Laxe's new movie, "Sirât," has become a sensation on the festival circuit for its unique portrayal of a dance party set against a vaguely apocalyptic backdrop. In a recent interview, Laxe described the film as a deeply sensorial and spiritual experience, focused on themes of crisis, catharsis, and community rather than a conventional narrative. He explained that his goal was to create a film that audiences feel physically, trusting in the power of its pounding music and visceral imagery to connect with viewers.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen set a new all-time Formula 1 record for the fastest lap during qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix, achieving an average speed of 164.466 mph. His performance at Monza surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020, a benchmark from an era of cars often considered the fastest in the sport's history. A combination of the current car's low-drag design, a newly resurfaced track with higher grip, and Monza's long straights contributed to the historic achievement.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing for the second nationwide test of its emergency alert system, which will send a 10-second siren-like sound and a message to all compatible mobile phones. Officials are urging the public to "keep their cool," emphasizing that it is only a test to ensure the system is ready for real-life threats such as extreme weather or terrorist attacks. The test follows a previous one that revealed several technical issues, and this new trial will help assess the system's current performance.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing countries that wrongfully detain American citizens abroad. The order empowers the State Department to create a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, which can trigger consequences such as economic sanctions and visa restrictions. The White House stated the new measure is designed to provide a robust response against foreign governments that use U.S. nationals as bargaining chips and to better protect Americans traveling and living overseas.</p>
