          <p>This article discusses the White House's exploration of policies to boost America's low birth rate, including a baby bonus. It argues that while a baby bonus might provide short-term relief, it's not enough to address the systemic neglect of child care, maternity leave, and child poverty. The author advocates for paid parental leave, expanded public child care, and a renewed expansion of the child tax credit as more effective ways to support mothers and promote thriving families. The article emphasizes that investing in mothers from pregnancy through childbirth and across the years of raising children is essential.</p>
