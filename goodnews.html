          <p>South America's Mercosur trade bloc and the four-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have successfully concluded a free trade agreement after a decade of negotiations. The deal unites a market of nearly 300 million people with a combined GDP exceeding $4.3 trillion. It aims to eliminate most customs duties and enhance market access for over 97% of exports between the blocs, which include nations like Brazil, Argentina, Switzerland, and Norway.

Her attorneys stated that her release came after mounting legal pressure and that ICE had previously attempted to deport her despite her pending green card application and marriage to a U.S. citizen.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, setting a 20% tariff on goods imported into the U.S. from the country. This new rate is lower than the 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect next week. As part of the deal, Vietnam will reportedly eliminate tariffs on U.S. products, granting American companies full market access. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at curbing the re-routing of Chinese products.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer identified two major trends influencing the stock market: global trade developments and the weakening U.S. dollar. He pointed to the new U.S. trade deal with Vietnam, which lowered threatened tariffs, as a positive catalyst for companies like Nike and Williams-Sonoma that manufacture there. Cramer also noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low benefits multinational consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble, by making their exports more competitive abroad. He suggests these broad narratives are currently more impactful for investors than daily economic minutiae. (not investment advice)</p>

Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index-tracking funds are required to purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios.

It also details the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," highlighting the crucial role of the band Los Lobos in re-recording his music for a new generation.
