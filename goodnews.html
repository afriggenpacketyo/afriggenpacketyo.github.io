          <h2>Weight-Loss Injections May Affect Contraception, Women Warned</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 05:42:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned women using weight-loss injections that these medications may impact the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. The MHRA advises that women should use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro and for a period afterward, with specific durations depending on the medication. Concerns have arisen that the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach. The MHRA has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, some of which have been unintended pregnancies, prompting the new guidance to ensure women are aware of the risks.</p>

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, named the AES100. This milestone underscores China's increasing ambitions in the aviation sector, particularly as it seeks to reduce reliance on foreign technologies. The move comes shortly after the U.S. announced new export restrictions targeting China, including curbs on jet engine-related technologies. While the AES100 differs from the jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts view its development as a significant advancement for the country's aviation capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that leprosy existed in the Americas prior to the arrival of European explorers, challenging the previous belief that it was solely introduced by early settlers. Researchers discovered that Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a second species of bacteria, was responsible for leprosy in the Americas. This bacterium infected humans for 1,000 years before Europeans arrived, indicating that the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations. The study, which involved analyzing DNA samples from ancient human remains, was conducted by scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the French National Center for Scientific Research, and the University of Colorado.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With an above-normal hurricane season predicted, experts are urging homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes. Homeowners should review policy limits, deductibles, and the need for flood insurance, as floods are typically not covered by standard policies. Experts recommend acting promptly, as insurers often suspend policy changes when a storm is approaching, and understanding your policy can provide peace of mind during hurricane season.</p>

Retailers like Currys reported record pre-orders, but some customers experienced cancellations. Despite the excitement, questions linger about whether the new console will match the success of its predecessor, partly due to higher game prices. The Switch 2 features upgraded hardware, including a larger screen and more power, but the launch lineup is limited, with Mario Kart World being the only new Nintendo game available at launch. The gaming community is divided, with some excited about the new console and others hesitant due to the cost.</p>

          <p>Ken Jennings, the host of "Jeopardy!", argues that trivia and the pursuit of general knowledge are essential for a well-functioning society.

Jennings laments the trivialization of trivia, noting its historical connection to fundamental academic courses. He emphasizes that shared cultural literacy and the ability to agree on verifiable answers are crucial for societal cohesion and the maintenance of democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The government in England has announced that any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, with the government setting aside ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the changes would save parents ¬£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While the announcement has been largely welcomed, some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective in reducing child poverty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed visa restrictions for international students could lead to a significant decline in their numbers at U.S. universities.

          <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revealed that the UK's inflation rate for April was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to a car tax data calculation error. The ONS initially reported an annual rate of 3.5%, but revised the figure to 3.4% after identifying an error in the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport. The incorrect data overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates applicable in the first year of registration. The ONS has apologized for the error and stated that it will use the correctly weighted data from May 2025 onward.</p>
