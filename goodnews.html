          <p>The Defense Department has rescinded the requirement for civilian employees to submit weekly reports detailing their accomplishments, a policy initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Jay Hurst, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, announced that the "five bullet exercise" is no longer mandatory. Employees are now encouraged to contribute ideas for improving efficiency and eliminating waste within the department. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, marking a shift away from the Musk-led DOGE's initial efforts to streamline the federal government.</p>

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Metropolitan Police, has cautioned that achieving the government's anti-crime objectives requires increased funding in the upcoming spending review. He commended the government's ambitious goals to reduce knife crime and violence against women, while emphasizing that financial resources are essential to realize these ambitions. Rowley highlighted the strain on police forces due to years of austerity cuts and called for radical reform in policing, including a more efficient national police agency. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is scheduled to present her spending review on June 11, outlining public service funding for the next several years.</p>

          <p>The word "pride" has evolved from a negative connotation of "inordinate self-esteem" to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment. The shift began in the LGBTQ+ community before the Stonewall Uprising, influenced by the civil rights movement's "Black pride" and "Black power." Organizer L. Craig Schoonmaker advocated for "pride" as a unifying slogan for the first march commemorating Stonewall, emphasizing self-esteem over power. While the LGBTQ+ community has made significant strides, recent pushback and anti-LGBTQ+ bills highlight the continued importance of the word's empowering message.</p>

The review found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent, often after they fell behind on bills.
