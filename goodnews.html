          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title, overcame Norrie's challenge, though Norrie felt he could have applied more pressure with better execution. Djokovic is set to face Alexander Zverev in the next round, a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final where Zverev emerged victorious after Djokovic sustained a hamstring injury. Jack Draper's loss to Alexander Bublik means that no British players remain in the singles competition at the French Open.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a large-scale drone attack, dubbed "Spider Web," targeting Russian air bases deep within Russia, including those housing nuclear-capable bombers. The operation, which took over a year and a half to prepare, involved smuggling drones into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that 117 drones were used in the attack, which aimed to strike legitimate military targets and cause significant losses to Russia. The operation is viewed as a strategic and symbolic blow, demonstrating Ukraine's ability to adapt and evolve its military tactics using drones, even with a limited amount of resources available to them. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Opening a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June could be a strategic financial move for savers, as the Federal Reserve is likely to implement rate cuts later in the summer. Locking in current rates, which are still relatively high, can protect against market volatility and ensure a steady return on investment. Depending on the CD term and interest rate, savers could earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest. It is important to consider the tax implications and ensure the money can remain untouched for the entire CD term to avoid penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being a four-time NBA champion and one of the greatest shooters of all time, Stephen Curry admits to experiencing impostor syndrome. Curry, the son of former NBA star Dell Curry, said he didn't grow up with the expectation to play in the league, which contributed to his underdog mentality. He has embraced this status and used it as motivation throughout his career. Curry also heads Thirty Ink, a house of brands, and is passionate about giving back through his nonprofit Eat. Learn.

          <p>Britain's defence review outlines grand ambitions for transforming the armed forces but faces challenges in securing adequate funding. While the review welcomes the government's "ambition" to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034, it suggests that faster progress may be necessary given turbulent times. Even the commitment to build up to 12 new attack submarines would require an increase in defence spending to at least 3% of GDP. The review highlights the war in Ukraine as evidence of rising threats and the fast pace of change.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles has resurfaced, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordering military services to make basic fitness standards for all combat jobs gender-neutral. This comes after the Obama administration opened all combat jobs to women in 2015. The article highlights the experiences of women like Emelie Vanasse, who became one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduated from Ranger school. Vanasse argues that lethality in combat extends beyond physical fitness and includes tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership.</p>
