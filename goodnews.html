          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly on Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019. Nike stopped selling its goods wholesale on Amazon six years ago due to concerns about counterfeit products. A Nike spokesperson stated that the company is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers. Amazon will begin sourcing a wider range of Nike products directly to expand its selection for U.S. customers. This deal is a win for Amazon, which has sought to attract more high-end brands to its platform.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, granting Mauritius sovereignty while allowing the US and UK to continue operating a military base on one of the islands for 99 years. The agreement follows negotiations and addresses Mauritius' claim that it was illegally forced to give away the islands for independence in 1968. The deal faced delays due to changes in government in both Mauritius and the US, with concerns raised about Mauritius' relationship with China. The UK government will update Parliament on the terms of the deal, which includes a multi-billion pound payment to Mauritius.</p>
