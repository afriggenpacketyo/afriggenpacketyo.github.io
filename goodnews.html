The leaders previously discussed the importance of stable bilateral relations in a phone call, highlighting improvements in ties following historical tensions related to Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. This year commemorates the 60th anniversary of normalizing diplomatic relations between the two nations, and the summit presents an opportunity to further strengthen their partnership.

          <p>Gold prices have surged this year, outperforming traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference noted gold's appeal lies in its independence from government liabilities, unlike sovereign bonds and currencies tied to specific economies. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced sell-offs due to policy volatility and credit rating downgrades, leading investors to seek alternative safe havens. Gold's status as a large, liquid, and apolitical asset further bolsters its attractiveness amid growing global instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration's directives to cancel research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), particularly those related to LGBTQ+ issues and DEI initiatives, were unlawful. The judge, William Young, stated that the cancellations violated federal law by discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community. The ruling orders the NIH to restore the terminated grants, which some estimates suggest totaled up to $1.8 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has expressed disagreement with the ruling, asserting that the grants prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor, and is considering legal options. </p>

          <p>A Chinese team of scientists has achieved a data transmission speed of 1Gbps from a satellite in stationary orbit using a 2-watt laser, surpassing the capabilities of Starlink. Led by Wu Jian and Liu Chao, the team employed a combination of adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR) to overcome atmospheric turbulence, which typically scatters light and weakens signals. This AO-MDR synergy represents a significant advancement in satellite laser downlink technology, enabling high-speed data transfer from a distance of 36,000 kilometers. The technology could potentially allow for beaming an HD movie from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would reduce the pace of government bond purchases starting in April of next year, while maintaining the benchmark rate at 0.5%. The BOJ aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets and support market stability by slowing cuts to 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027. This decision comes as Japan's economy faces growth uncertainty and inflation remains above the BOJ's target, partly due to a rice shortage. While accommodative financial conditions are expected to provide support, the central bank acknowledges the likelihood of moderating economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has hinted that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned, with state media referring to an "era" of three carriers for the Chinese navy. New satellite images reveal 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, indicating a higher capacity than China's existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests the new markings indicate preparations for commissioning and trial service. Further sea trials and coordination exercises are expected before the Fujian formally enters service, potentially by the end of the year.</p>
