          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic. Forecasters anticipate it will strengthen into a hurricane but expect the system to stay over open waters, passing east of Bermuda without making landfall. While no watches or warnings are in effect, swells generated by the storm are projected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada early next week. The season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

After winning, she decided to give $50,000 each to the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD), Shalom Farms, and the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society. The donation to AFTD honors her late husband, who died from the disease, while the other charities support local food access and military families, reflecting her personal values. Edwards stated that she felt blessed and wanted to use the windfall to bless others, hoping her act of generosity inspires similar giving.</p>

          <p>Common consumer electronics are increasingly incorporating features that serve as powerful accessibility aids, transforming them from lifestyle gadgets into health and wellness tools. For instance, Apple's AirPods have received FDA authorization to function as over-the-counter hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss, offering a more affordable and less stigmatized solution. Other advancements include live translation features, Google's Lookout app for the visually impaired, and the availability of over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors. This trend signifies a move toward integrating accessibility into mainstream technology, providing greater agency and independence for people with sensory declines, disabilities, or chronic conditions.</p>

They were narrowly beaten by Kenya's Lilian Odira, who took gold with a championship record time. For Hunter Bell, the silver medal marks a high point in her return to the sport after a five-year hiatus. Hodgkinson's bronze is also a significant achievement, as the Olympic champion has been battling serious injury setbacks throughout the season, making her fifth consecutive global podium finish particularly remarkable.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests 2026 Midterm Control of House Hinges More on Voters Than Redistricting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite intense partisan battles over redistricting in states like Texas and California, control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections will likely be decided by broader political factors rather than gerrymandering alone. Historically, the party not holding the presidency often gains a significant number of seats. Key indicators to watch will be President Trump's approval rating, voter enthusiasm, and public opinion on the economy and major legislation. While partisan map-making could shift several seats, analysts suggest these gains may not be enough to overcome a strong national trend, ultimately placing the outcome in the hands of the electorate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era dominated by streaming and declining box office revenue, repertory cinemas in Los Angeles are enduring by providing unique and communal viewing experiences. Theaters like Vidiots' Eagle Theater and the American Cinematheque draw sold-out crowds for screenings of classic films on 35mm prints, often supplemented with special events and Q&A sessions. This model caters to a niche audience of cinephiles seeking a carefully curated alternative to mainstream multiplexes. While the nonprofit business model relies on donations and memberships, these independent theaters play a vital role in revitalizing film culture and fostering the next generation of movie lovers.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is poised to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move intended to increase pressure for a resolution to the conflict in Gaza and preserve the viability of a two-state solution. The decision follows a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, conditioning the move on Israel's failure to agree to a ceasefire and other peace-oriented steps. This action, expected ahead of the UN General Assembly, aligns the UK with other nations like France and Canada but faces opposition from the U.S. and Israel, who argue it rewards terrorism. UK officials maintain that Hamas will have no role in a future Palestinian government.</p>

          <p>King Charles III paid a special visit to Ethel Caterham, who at 116 years old is the world's oldest living person. Mrs. Caterham, a resident of a care home in Surrey, became the oldest person in April and is the last surviving British subject born during the reign of Edward VII. During the visit, she fondly recalled the King's 1969 investiture as the Prince of Wales, telling him that "all the girls were in love with you." Born in 1909, she has lived through two world wars, the Russian Revolution, and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

She argues that college provides an unparalleled environment for building a network of smart, ambitious peers who can become future co-founders, employees, and lifelong friends.

          <p>The University of Southern California's football team defeated Michigan State 45-31 to improve its record to 4-0. USC's offense, led by receiver Makai Lemon who had 127 receiving yards, was dominant, accumulating 517 total yards. However, the team's performance was marred by a lack of discipline, with 10 penalties for 88 yards allowing Michigan State to remain competitive into the fourth quarter. Despite the defensive lapses and penalties, USC mounted a crucial late-game scoring drive to seal the win, though tougher opponents await in the coming weeks.</p>
