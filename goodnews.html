          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has successfully produced the first barrel of uranium from a new demonstration project in Inner Mongolia's Ordos basin. The project is being touted as a "green, safe, intelligent and efficient" mining method that avoids tunnels and toxic waste. This development marks a shift in China's uranium sourcing, moving towards sandstone-type deposits in the north. The new approach could significantly enhance China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium market and support its nuclear energy ambitions.</p>

          <p>This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., focused on youth and the future of culture, showcasing artisans from diverse backgrounds. Featured participants included a Maya artist teaching indigenous traditions, Bolivian rappers blending hip-hop with native languages, and fourth-generation Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton. The event also highlighted refugee weavers from the Karen ethnic group who are revitalizing their ancient craft. These stories emphasize the importance of passing down cultural heritage and empowering young people to keep their traditions alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK cabinet minister has stated that the government is considering additional regulations to protect children online, building on new age-verification rules that take effect this month. Overseen by the regulator Ofcom, these rules will require platforms to implement stricter age checks and adjust algorithms to filter harmful content from children's feeds. While these measures are seen as a foundation, the Technology Secretary is reportedly exploring further actions to address issues like addictive online habits among young people. Ofcom's chief acknowledged that future legislation might be needed to keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing crisis, California is creating a new cabinet-level agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency to create a more focused body. Supporters hope this will streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing funding programs, which are currently spread across different departments. Critics, however, are skeptical that a bureaucratic reshuffle alone will solve the state's deep-seated affordability and construction cost problems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column reflects on LeBron James's future with the Lakers, as he enters the final year of his contract without an extension. The author suggests James is in a difficult position on a team now built around Luka Doncic and could benefit from controlling his own exit narrative. The article draws a parallel to Kobe Bryant's 2015 retirement announcement, which led to a celebrated farewell tour that allowed fans nationwide to show appreciation. The author posits that announcing his retirement ahead of his final season could allow James a similar, well-managed departure from the sport.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Caltech are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into living jellyfish, which could revolutionize ocean data collection. The devices stimulate the jellyfish's muscles, allowing researchers to guide their movement and gather environmental information on temperature and pressure. Because jellyfish have no central nervous system or pain receptors, the process is considered humane, and the low cost could make large-scale ocean monitoring accessible to more research groups. The team is now working on improving the device's durability for deep-sea exploration and adding steering capabilities.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pushed back against the narrative that artificial intelligence will lead to mass layoffs of white-collar workers. Speaking at a global summit, Benioff stated that he sees AI as a tool for "radical augmentation of the workforce," not replacement. He revealed that Salesforce has paused hiring for some roles like engineers to first integrate AI and realize its productivity gains, while simultaneously ramping up sales hires to meet customer demand for AI deployment. He believes this shift will ultimately lead to an expansion of small and medium-sized businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis of the third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano argues that its significance lay not in chaotic drama but in its tactical maturity. Unlike their previous brawls, this match was a controlled, strategic affair, which the author posits is a form of progress for women's boxing, granting female fighters the right to "win ugly" like their male counterparts. The article reflects on the contradictions within the sport, where women fight for the choice to risk their bodies for glory in an environment still marked by objectification. Ultimately, the trilogy is framed as a historic achievement that has advanced the sport.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This rare specimen represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by Ankara. The PKK's demands include Ocalan's release and amnesty for fighters, while the Turkish government is waiting for the group to fully dismantle its structures. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria, potentially boosting its geopolitical standing.</p>

While celebrated as a watershed moment for global activism and rock 'n' roll's political power, its legacy is also viewed critically. The event has been criticized for its lack of African performers and for reinforcing a "white savior" narrative and a patronizing image of Africa. Despite these flaws, organizers like Bob Geldof maintain that it successfully put the issue on the global agenda and led to tangible political actions, like debt cancellation.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK, supported by MP Becky Gittins, is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to protect allergy sufferers. Current regulations require ingredients to be listed using the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system based on Latin and scientific names. Campaigners argue this system is confusing and potentially dangerous for consumers with severe allergies who may not recognize allergens like "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis" as sweet almond oil. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system, citing the need for global harmonization.</p>
