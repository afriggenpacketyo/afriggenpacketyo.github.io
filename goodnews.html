          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team is now likely to face host nation England in the World Cup quarter-finals following a defeat to Canada. Despite a strong performance and securing a last-eight spot with previous wins, the Scots were overcome by the world's number two ranked team. Canada established a lead through tries from McKinley Hunt, Emily Tuttosi, and a penalty try, holding off a Scottish comeback that included scores from Rhona Lloyd and Evie Gallagher. The loss positions Canada to top Pool B, setting up a compelling knockout stage for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially launched the effort to build his presidential library and museum in his home state of Delaware. A 13-person governance board, including former aides and allies, has been established by the Joe and Jill Biden Foundation to spearhead the fundraising and site selection process. The project faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate, with costs for presidential libraries often running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The vision for the library includes an immersive museum detailing his presidency and a center for leadership, service, and civic engagement.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare live-streamed dive to the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. The expedition, conducted by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named Emmy, explored depths of over 1,500 feet, showcasing the unique ecosystem of the ancient lakebed. Hosted by environmental non-profits, the event aimed to raise awareness about the lake's ecological importance and the challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts discussed the lake's geological history and unique species, while also dispelling popular myths about mob bodies, though they did note the discovery of trash in past dives.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has unveiled a comprehensive plan to boost PepsiCo's performance, after taking a $4 billion stake in the consumer goods giant. The proposal urges the company to refranchise its bottling network, streamline its product portfolio by divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and reinvest capital into core brands such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott argues that strategic missteps in Pepsi's North American beverage and food divisions have led to significant stock underperformance and a valuation discount compared to competitors like Coca-Cola. The firm believes its plan could unlock over 50% upside for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bernadette Joy, a self-made millionaire and financial coach, advocates for renting as a viable wealth-building strategy, challenging the traditional view of homeownership as the primary path to financial success. Despite having previously owned four properties, she and her husband sold them to return to renting, a move she says accelerated their journey to their second million in net worth. Joy argues that renting provides greater flexibility and frees up capital and mental energy that would otherwise be spent on hidden homeownership costs like maintenance, renovations, and property management. She invests the proceeds and savings into a portfolio of index funds.</p>

          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur's leadership will now be helmed by new chief executive Vinai Venkatesham, who previously spent 14 years at rival club Arsenal. Venkatesham is known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta, championing the growth of Arsenal's women's team, and providing empathetic leadership during the pandemic. Described as an intelligent and inclusive leader, he is expected to work closely with the club's technical director and head coach on football-related decisions. His more amiable personality may also shift the dynamics of Tottenham's boardroom relationships with other clubs.</p>

          <p>A mother's persistence after her one-year-old son, Jonny, experienced a relentless series of infections led to the diagnosis of malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and aggressive cancer. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital discovered a grapefruit-sized tumor in his liver, a condition with a very poor prognosis. Jonny underwent a complex and individualized treatment plan involving intensive chemotherapy, surgery to remove the shrunken tumor, and radiation. Now over two years old, Jonny is in remission and undergoing careful surveillance, with his family celebrating his recovery after a harrowing year of treatment and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Researchers and doctors are expressing optimism about recent advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Key developments include the FDA approval of a new blood test for early diagnosis and growing evidence from studies like the U.S. POINTER Study that lifestyle interventions can improve cognitive function. This research reinforces that a regimen of physical activity, a healthy diet, cognitive exercises, and social engagement can delay memory loss and even improve mental acuity in at-risk individuals. Experts note that many of these prevention and treatment strategies would have been considered fiction just a decade ago.</p>

          <p>China is designing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to deflect a near-Earth asteroid, according to the chief designer of the country's lunar exploration program. The mission, which officials hope to launch this year, would involve sending an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. The goal is to alter the asteroid's orbit by a few centimeters, demonstrating the "kinetic impact" technique for planetary defense. If successful, China would join the United States as the only other nation to have demonstrated this capability, following NASA's DART mission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices reaching new records this year, gaining about 35% to near $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Experts suggest that economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut are driving the rally. For those seeking exposure, financial advisors typically recommend using low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). They generally advise against owning physical bullion due to higher costs and suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the musical *Hamilton* is being re-examined as it arrives in movie theaters for the first time, prompting questions about how its once-celebrated progressive message holds up. The article suggests the show's optimistic, Obama-era vision of America feels different in the current political climate, with its "Act One" hopefulness giving way to the "Act Two" fear of political fracture. While initially embraced across the political spectrum, the show later became a symbol of counter-Trump sentiment. The commentary also notes that critiques of the musical's historical inaccuracies and its glossing over of the founders' flaws have become more mainstream over time.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church is set to canonize Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, making him the first Millennial saint. Acutis, who grew up with the internet, has been dubbed a "computer genius" by the Vatican for using his skills to create a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles. His story presents a blend of modern relatability—he played video games and wore Nikes—and traditional piety, appealing both to those seeking a contemporary role model and those drawn to the faith's supernatural elements. His rapid path to sainthood reflects the Church's effort to engage with younger generations in the digital age.</p>

The long-overdue recognition comes amid a broader national conversation about how American history is remembered and taught. The medal was accepted by a descendant of one of the soldiers and will be housed at the Smithsonian Institution to preserve the legacy of their service and sacrifice.</p>
