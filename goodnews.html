          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship is Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:33:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has declared the Trump administration's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's decision. The ruling from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals represents another significant legal setback for the policy, which aims to deny citizenship to most individuals born on U.S. soil. The court agreed that the order would cause irreparable harm by depriving a class of people of their citizenship rights. This legal battle is expected to continue, likely heading to the Supreme Court for a final determination on the principle embedded in the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:27:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major study suggests that walking just 7,000 steps per day can substantially lower the risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research indicates this may be a more achievable and evidence-based target than the widely promoted 10,000-step goal, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. The findings show significant health benefits compared to lower activity levels, with many advantages leveling off after 7,000 steps. Researchers hope this more realistic benchmark will encourage more people to track their steps as a practical way to improve their overall health.</p>

          <h2>Australian Women Win Right to Sue Qatar Airways Over Invasive Airport Searches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:22:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five Australian women who were subjected to invasive strip-searches at Doha's airport in 2020 have won a crucial legal victory, allowing them to proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways. An Australian federal court overturned a previous ruling that had dismissed the case, finding that the airline could potentially be held responsible under international travel laws. The women were removed from a flight and examined after a newborn was found abandoned in the airport. Their lawsuit seeks damages for unlawful physical contact and false imprisonment, and the case is now expected to proceed to trial.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic relations. Despite the anniversary, the summit was marked by significant disagreements over trade, market access, and industrial policies. President Xi called for strengthened cooperation and mutual trust, while the EU expressed concerns about an uneven playing field for its companies. The talks, reduced to a single day, aimed to provide a frank discussion on all aspects of the complex and often strained relationship.</p>

          <h2>Rare Purple Sea Snail Appears on Southern California Beach, Possibly Due to Warming Waters</h2>

          <p>A rare, vibrant purple sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in Southern California. These pelagic snails float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft and are usually found in warmer subtropical waters. Researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography noted this is the first local sighting in a decade and it coincided with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists will monitor for more appearances if warm water trends continue, suggesting the snails could be an indicator of changing ocean conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly beating market expectations. The surge is driven by powerful demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies. As a key supplier to industry leader Nvidia, SK Hynix has solidified its dominance in the HBM market, even overtaking rival Samsung in the broader DRAM market. The company anticipates continued strong demand for the rest of the year, fueled by ongoing AI investments from major tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom now require websites hosting pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems to prevent access by minors. Under the Online Safety Act, platforms must use methods like credit card checks or photo ID matching to confirm users are 18 or older, with potential fines up to £18 million for non-compliance. While regulators aim to make it harder for children to access adult material, concerns remain about user privacy and the effectiveness of these checks. Critics worry that determined users, including minors, may bypass the rules using VPNs, and many adults are hesitant to share personal data with these platforms.</p>

          <p>After making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The change in stance comes after a tense spring training where his role was a point of contention, and he had previously rejected the idea of moving to first base while with the Red Sox.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% rise in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This export surge was partly fueled by companies expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. trade tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts caution that future growth may be challenged by softening global trade and the ongoing uncertainty of tariff negotiations with the United States.

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see imports from the two nations face a 19% tariff while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, the effectiveness of this strategy may be limited, as Chinese companies have been proactively localizing their production within Southeast Asia over the past several years. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment hubs that previous U.S. policies targeted. (not investment advice)</p>
