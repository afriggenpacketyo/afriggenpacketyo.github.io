          <p>Canada and Malta have declared their intention to officially recognize the state of Palestine in September at the United Nations General Assembly, joining France and the UK in this diplomatic move. The Canadian recognition is conditioned on the Palestinian Authority holding elections in 2026 without Hamas's involvement and demilitarizing the future state. This coordinated effort by several Western nations aims to advance a two-state solution and increase pressure for a lasting peace agreement in the nearly 80-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

The "Piprahwa Gems," which were set to be auctioned, were instead acquired by the Godrej Industries Group and will now be permanently displayed in India. The planned sale had sparked a major ethical debate over whether sacred artifacts, especially those associated with human remains, should be commercialized, with critics arguing they are part of a shared cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Navy F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in California, but the pilot managed to eject safely before the impact. The aircraft, which was attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron, went down on Wednesday evening. Officials confirmed that no other personnel were harmed in the incident, which also sparked a small grass fire that was subsequently contained. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation by naval authorities.</p>
