        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman now suggests that investment portfolios should allocate between 10% and 40% to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous 1% recommendation. He attributes this shift to the maturation of crypto into a mainstream asset class and the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio model due to increased human longevity. Edelman argues that crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets and its potential for high returns make it a crucial component for modern long-term investment strategies. The article also notes a record $2.1 billion in crypto hacks in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement also grants the United States access to the DRC's substantial mineral deposits, including gold, copper, and lithium.

          <p>The S&P 500 closed at a new record of 6,173, recovering more than 24% since its sharp decline in April following the announcement of new tariffs. Investor confidence has been bolstered by easing trade tensions and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, with a strong rebound in technology stocks also driving the market's gains. Despite the positive momentum, some analysts express caution, warning of complacency regarding trade issues. The market rally occurred alongside new data showing a slight increase in inflation, with the core rate rising to 2.7%. (not investment advice)</p>

Sources suggest Brentford is holding out for a higher upfront fee for the 25-year-old Cameroonian international, who scored 20 goals last season. Mbeumo, who has one year left on his contract, is also attracting interest from other top clubs, including Tottenham.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. This move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as productions are increasingly lured to other states with more generous incentives. The expansion aims to bring production back to California and revitalize the local industry, which has faced challenges from strikes and competition. A related bill seeks to broaden eligibility and increase the credit percentage to make the state more competitive.</p>

The Foreign Office still advises against all travel to Gaza and specific areas near the borders.

The film, which evolved from Gallo's USC thesis project, tells the story of a Latine sex worker in New Jersey seeking to escape a life of crime and reconcile with a difficult past. Gallo, a first-generation Salvadoran American, uses the film to explore themes of identity, masculinity, and freedom. The project aims to shed light on the intersex community, which Gallo notes is often invisible in cultural conversations and negatively impacted by anti-trans legislation.</p>

Analysts attribute the surge to diminishing concerns over fee compression and regulatory uncertainty, particularly after the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins.

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2's use of an LCD screen instead of an OLED has led to a new controversy among gamers and tech analysts regarding its performance. Critics and testers have pointed out that the screen has a slower pixel response time compared to typical gaming displays, which can result in motion blur or 'ghosting' in fast-paced games. Furthermore, while the console is marketed with HDR capabilities, its screen's peak brightness falls short of the technical specifications for a true High Dynamic Range image. Despite these objective technical shortcomings, many users still find the display to be bright and enjoyable for gaming.</p>
