          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned after a lengthy legal battle. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, had been the subject of a dispute after a South Korean temple claimed it was plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, leading to the statue's return, which is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony. This event concludes a contentious issue that strained relations between Japan and South Korea.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has ended four days of intense hostilities, but experts believe it will not easily lead to lasting peace due to long-term distrust. While the US played a decisive role in mediating the ceasefire, analysts from both countries emphasize that addressing underlying issues like terrorism and water security is crucial for enduring stability. Both sides reportedly used the military escalation to test each other's resolve, realizing the devastating potential of a full-scale war. Saudi Arabia and Iran also emerged as key mediators due to their strong economic and diplomatic ties with both India and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses, siblings, parents, and grown-up children of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad, while immigrants will need to wait ten years to become British citizens. The government's actions are viewed as an attempt to seize the narrative from Reform UK, which gained ground in recent local elections. However, the Conservative party has criticized the plans as insufficient, arguing they lack a cap on numbers and questioning how success will be measured.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains highly popular in the Philippines, as evidenced by the outpouring of support following his arrest and extradition to The Hague.

His arrest has sharply divided the Philippines, with some believing he is a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte, has seen her approval rating rise, positioning her as a potential future presidential candidate.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's bill targeting federal payments for abortion providers could face opposition from moderate House Republicans. The provision aims to make large groups providing abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid funds, but concerns have been raised about the definition of these groups.

          <p>Donald Trump's Middle East tour this week has gained significance due to recent developments in Ukraine, Gaza, and US-China trade relations. Steps are being taken towards possible peace in both Ukraine and Gaza, and Washington claimed 'substantial progress' in trade talks with China. Trump's tour includes visits to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE.
