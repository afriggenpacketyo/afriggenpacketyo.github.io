          <p>Trade talks between Canada and the United States are set to resume following Canada's decision to scrap its planned Digital Services Tax. The tax, which would have levied a 3% charge on revenue from Canadian users of major tech firms like Google and Amazon, drew strong condemnation from President Trump, who had suspended negotiations in response. Prime Minister Mark Carney's administration rescinded the tax "in anticipation" of a new trade deal, a move some analysts view as a concession to U.S. pressure. The negotiations aim to address a range of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Canadian goods.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in a specific protein, according to a new study conducted on monkeys. The findings, published in *Nature Aging*, offer a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular patterns of aging in the cochlea. Significantly, the study also found that the common diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of this hearing loss in the primates. This discovery opens potential new avenues for developing treatments and personalized medicine for the condition in humans.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink, Precision Neuroscience, and Synchron, are advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology from experimental stages toward commercial products. These surgically implanted devices aim to help individuals with paralysis or loss of speech by translating brain signals into commands for computers or synthetic speech generators. While Neuralink has gained public attention, competitors are also making significant strides, some using less invasive techniques that may ease FDA approval. The first generation of these devices will likely enable users to control cursors and communicate, offering life-changing potential despite challenges like data processing and high costs.</p>

Experts like Jeff Andrews and Beth Diana Smith advise that any room, including a bathroom, benefits from a strong focal point, which art can provide. They suggest a wide range of possibilities, from personal travel photos and children's drawings to more elegant or whimsical pieces, cautioning against "bathroom-specific" art. The key is to select pieces that reflect personal style and enhance the space, while being mindful of potential moisture damage for valuable works.</p>

          <p>China's entertainment industry is taking an aggressive, "no-holds-barred" approach to artificial intelligence, starkly contrasting with Hollywood's more cautious stance. A government-backed foundation announced plans to use AI to "revitalize" 100 classic kung fu films, including works by Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, for new global audiences through animation and other reinterpretations. This initiative highlights the different cultural and regulatory attitudes toward AI, as U.S. guilds and artists raise concerns about intellectual property and artistic integrity. Meanwhile, Chinese officials and companies see AI as a powerful tool for cultural outreach and production efficiency.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a stringent new law banning smoking in many outdoor public areas, including parks, beaches, and near schools, as part of a move toward a "tobacco-free generation." The ban, which took effect Sunday, aims to protect children from exposure to tobacco smoke, with violators facing significant fines. While polls show public support for tighter restrictions, some smokers view the measure as excessive. The law is a major step in the country's ongoing efforts to curb smoking rates, which remain higher than in many other Western nations, although it does not currently apply to e-cigarettes.</p>

CEO Steve Huffman is betting that the authenticity of human discussion will remain a key differentiator against "sterile answers from AI."

          <p>For the first time in its 148-year history, the Wimbledon Championships will not use human line judges, opting instead for a fully electronic line-calling system. The move aligns Wimbledon with other major tournaments but marks the end of a long-standing tradition. While proponents of the technology point to increased accuracy and pace of play, some former officials, players, and fans lament the loss of a human element and personality from the iconic event.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Amazon's business model suggests its future growth is heavily reliant on its two most profitable divisions: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising. While e-commerce remains its largest revenue source, the high operating margins of AWS and the rapidly expanding ad business are driving significant profit increases. In the first quarter, AWS accounted for 63% of the company's operating profits despite being only 19% of its revenue. This dynamic of profit growing faster than revenue positions Amazon as a strong long-term investment, though catching market-cap leader Nvidia by 2030 is considered unlikely.

          <p>In a poignant meeting facilitated by the USC Shoah Foundation, Holocaust survivor Andrew Roth and U.S. Army veteran Jack Moran met, eighty years after their paths first crossed at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Moran was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate the camp in April 1945, where Roth was a teenage prisoner. Both men, now approaching 100 years old, shared their harrowing experiences of the war and the Holocaust. The reunion highlights the race against time to document the testimonies of the few remaining survivors and witnesses of the era.</p>

          <h2>Experts and Survivors Offer Guidance on How to Support a Friend with Cancer</h2>

          <p>When a friend is diagnosed with cancer, providing meaningful support can be challenging, but survivors and advocates offer key advice. They emphasize the importance of simply being present and reaching out, as social isolation is a common and painful experience for patients. Instead of offering platitudes or comparisons, it is better to listen without judgment and allow the person space to vent. When offering help, be specific with suggestions like "Can I drop off a pizza?" rather than a vague "Let me know if you need anything," which places the burden on the patient.</p>

          <p>A woman named Karen de Boer recounts a pivotal moment from her freshman year of college in 1990 when she was shown unexpected kindness. After oversleeping and missing the bus for a prestigious choir performance, she was distraught, fearing she would be kicked out. Her hallmate, Pam, with whom she had a rocky relationship due to noise complaints, offered to drive her an hour to the performance. This act of forgiveness and generosity, from someone she felt she hadn't treated well, left a lasting impression on de Boer, teaching her a profound lesson about kindness.</p>
