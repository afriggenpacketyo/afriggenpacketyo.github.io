          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal tests, potentially leading to a universal antivenom. Friede's motivation stemmed from a desire to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, after nearly dying from cobra bites early in his self-experimentation. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target common neurotoxin classes, creating an antivenom cocktail that has shown significant protection in mice.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe social media should be regulated during elections to combat the spread of misinformation, following criticism of online posts that influenced a Hyogo gubernatorial election. The digest also notes Donald Trump's proposed 13% increase in the U.S. defense budget to deter China, and Japan's low ranking among G7 nations in world press freedom. Additionally, the article mentions holiday traffic congestion in Japan during Golden Week, an international body joining the Osaka expo to promote fusion energy, and a man in Osaka being sent to prosecutors for allegedly running over seven elementary school pupils.</p>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and mainland China. The museum, home to Chinese art and artifacts, saw a record 6.14 million visitors in 2016, including 3.32 million from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. However, in 2024, only 50,000 visitors came from these regions, while the largest overseas groups were from South Korea and Japan. The museum aims to attract 3.5 million visitors in 2025, despite the ongoing cross-strait tensions and travel restrictions.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows.

This action comes before the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where potential interest rate cuts are expected to influence further capital movement.

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and centralize power under the Communist Party. The reforms involve merging ministries, closing media outlets, and eliminating public sector jobs, potentially affecting 100,000 positions. This restructuring aims to address bureaucratic dysfunction and external pressures like potential US tariffs. It also serves to consolidate power for To Lam, the new party chief, ahead of the 14th National Congress in 2026, by reducing the number of provinces and party branches.</p>

          <p>President Trump's elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods from China and Hong Kong is impacting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The exemption had allowed goods valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. without import taxes, boosting low-cost retailers like Temu and Shein, who heavily advertised online. As these companies raise prices and shift to local fulfillment models, they are reducing their advertising spending, leading to a decline in revenue for the tech giants. Temu has stopped shipping products directly from China to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in local elections across England, winning control of 10 councils and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. Labour and the Conservatives both suffered major defeats, failing to retain any councils they previously controlled. The Liberal Democrats and Greens also saw gains, increasing their number of councillors. Reform UK's success reflects a shift in voter preferences, with traditional parties losing ground. Mayoral elections were more mixed, with Labour retaining three positions, Conservatives gaining one, and Reform UK winning two new mayoralties.</p>
