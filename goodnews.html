          <p>In response to recent quality control issues in the aeronautics industry, China is highlighting the advanced manufacturing of its C919 passenger jet. The assembly line utilizes a "smart factory" concept, integrating 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect all sensors, robots, and workers. This unified system aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts by creating a single, intelligent loop for data collection, communication, and control, representing a significant step in domestic aerospace technology.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely partners in the proposed deal to manage TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other key American figures involved, praising them as patriots who would handle the platform responsibly. The comments come as the final details of the agreement, which aims to address national security concerns about the app's Chinese ownership, are still being negotiated.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed interview, French President Emmanuel Macron explained his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, framing it as a necessary step to provide a political alternative to Hamas and isolate the militant group. He outlined a multi-phase peace plan beginning with a ceasefire and hostage release, followed by a transitional governance structure for Gaza and long-term two-state solution talks. Macron argued that without a diplomatic path, Palestinians are left with no option but extremism, making recognition essential for regional security and Israel's own long-term safety.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have formally recognized a Palestinian state, joining a growing international consensus. The leaders of all three nations framed the decision as an effort to revive the two-state solution and build momentum for peace, explicitly stating it is not a reward for Hamas. The announcement drew sharp criticism from Israel and the United States, who argue the timing is inappropriate and undermines diplomatic efforts to secure hostage releases.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of swimmers took part in the first organized swim in the Chicago River in almost 100 years, celebrating the waterway's remarkable transformation from a toxic sewer to a recreational hub. The event marks a milestone in decades-long environmental cleanup efforts, spurred by the 1970s Clean Water Act, which have restored the river's ecosystem and reconnected it to the city's public life. Organizers hope the swim will become an annual event, symbolizing the success of urban river restoration and inspiring similar initiatives in other cities.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is debating a shift in its long-held opposition to national ID cards, a policy they previously blocked in 2010. Leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, citing Estonia's digital ID system as a potentially positive model focused on citizen access to services. However, many party members remain concerned about civil liberties, data security, and the potential for abuse by an authoritarian government, highlighting a significant internal debate on the issue.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson is taking on his most challenging role yet, portraying real-life mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson revealed that he was nervous about the raw, dramatic part, which required him to tap into personal trauma to authentically portray Kerr's struggles with addiction and depression. He explained that after years of focusing on box office success, he sought a role that would be more creatively fulfilling and allow him to metaphorically "rip myself open."</p>

This local action is part of a wider campaign, supported by other councils and major retailers, calling for a UK-wide legislative ban on the sale of these hazardous items.</p>

          <p>A credit expert warns consumers not to automatically choose no-annual-fee credit cards, arguing that cards with modest fees often provide significantly better rewards and perks that justify the cost. The article highlights key mistakes to avoid, such as hoarding points, which can be devalued by issuers, and failing to negotiate with the card company for retention offers before canceling or downgrading. It stresses the importance of selecting a card that aligns with current spending habits and periodically reassessing if it still provides optimal value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>DNA analysis of two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter has revealed they belong to a genetic lineage previously unknown to science. The women were herders during the "Green Sahara" period but their DNA did not match expected Sub-Saharan groups. Instead, their ancestry diverged much earlier and remained largely isolated, suggesting that pastoralism may have spread through cultural exchange rather than migration. This finding challenges previous understandings of population movements and interactions in ancient North Africa.</p>
