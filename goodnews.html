          <h2>Opinion Piece Suggests Indonesia's President-elect Could Offer a New Pragmatic Global Diplomacy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new global diplomatic approach centered on "constructive pragmatism." As international institutions like the United Nations face paralysis from competing interests, Indonesia's status as an economic power with ties to various ideological camps allows it to act as a bridge. The author argues that Prabowo's leadership could provide a practical roadmap for a new world order that emphasizes cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a necessary corrective for a dysfunctional international system, focusing on actionable solutions rather than revolutionary rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. Del Toro described the project as a decades-long dream, aiming for a grand scale and a different interpretation that humanizes the creature. The nearly two-and-a-half-hour film has received a mixed critical reception; some have praised it as one of del Toro's finest works for its epic scope and artistry, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance. The director emphasized his use of physical sets over CGI to enhance actor performances.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, this article examines how remembering the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could serve as a foundation for improving current bilateral relations. The piece highlights a forgotten history of collaboration, including the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen from the Japanese army. By focusing on these historical moments of mutual support and shared sacrifice, the article suggests that a ground-up approach extolling this past alliance could offer a formula for rebuilding trust. This historical perspective is presented as a potential antidote to contemporary geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," explores the theme that her recent superstardom has failed to improve the quality of her romantic life. The album, a follow-up to her breakout hit "Short n' Sweet," continues to feature her witty and sharp commentary on dealing with disappointing men, from empty talkers to self-obsessed partners. Produced with collaborators like Jack Antonoff, the album blends '70s AM-radio pop with disco and country influences. While some critics find it slightly less sharp than its predecessor, tracks like "Goodbye" and "House Tour" are praised for their clever lyricism and catchy production.</p>

In a social media post, Trump described his anger upon discovering the damage and his immediate demand for an investigation. White House security footage reportedly identified the culprits as subcontractors using a broken steel cart that scraped against the stone. Trump stated that the stone will be replaced at the contractor's expense and that the company will be barred from future work at the White House, emphasizing that "surfaces are very important to me as a Builder."</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Guidelines on Safe Screen Time for Children at Different Developmental Stages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among health experts offers precautionary guidelines for children's screen time based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised to ensure it doesn't replace crucial activities like physical play, social interaction, and imaginative development. While acknowledging the unrealistic nature of completely eliminating screens for adolescents, experts stress the importance of monitoring content, maintaining open communication, and setting clear family rules to foster healthy media habits.</p>

The 79-year-old was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Sterling, Virginia. The online speculation was fueled by recent comments from J.D.

Concerns about Trump's health have been a recurring topic, with recent attention on a bruise on his hand and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, though his physician maintains he remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, the mayor's administration has proposed new measures to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and expanding the health department's inspection capacity.</p>
