        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a sharp 34.5% decline in shipments to the U.S., marking the steepest drop since February 2020. Imports from the U.S. also decreased by over 18%, leading to a reduction in China's trade surplus with the U.S. to $18 billion. Overall exports rose by 4.8%, while imports plunged by 3.4%, attributed to sluggish domestic demand. This was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. (not investment advice)</p>
