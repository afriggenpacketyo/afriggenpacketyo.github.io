        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal case, calling the Department of Justice's reasoning "demonstrably false." Judge Paul Engelmayer stated the materials would not reveal significant new information about Jeffrey Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes and suggested the move could be a political "diversion." The judge emphasized that the transcripts do not contain a "client list" or new details about Epstein's death, countering public speculation fueled by right-wing influencers. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Forecasters have announced the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, which has the potential to strengthen into the first hurricane of the current season. This development occurs within a season that the National Weather Service has predicted to be above-normal, with an expected 13 to 18 named storms. A storm is classified as a hurricane when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 74 mph. This article serves as an initial alert for the developing weather system, with more updates expected as it progresses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to business academic and author Suzy Welch, long-term career success is a function of three key elements she calls PIE: Personal relationships, Ideas, and Execution. Rather than forced networking, she advocates for building genuine friendships, which create stronger and more reliable professional support systems. Success also requires a few original, high-impact ideas, which can range from transformative business models to simple process improvements. Finally, Welch highlights execution as the most underrated skill, noting that the ability to reliably complete projects is highly valued by leaders and is a critical driver of career advancement.</p>

          <p>Gary Grant, founder of the UK's largest toy retailer, The Entertainer, is transferring 100% ownership of the company to his 1,900 employees through an employee trust. Grant, who started the business with his wife in 1981, chose this path to preserve the company's family-like culture and Christian-based values, which include donating 10% of profits to charity. This move ensures that staff will receive a share of future profits and have a say in the company's operations. The decision was made as part of a long-term succession plan, prioritizing legacy over a purely monetary sale.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski is keeping the team's quarterback situation uncertain following an impressive preseason performance by rookie Shedeur Sanders. When asked if he would name a Week 1 starter after the next preseason game, Stefanski stated he was "not there yet" and also declined to confirm if Sanders would start. The intrigue intensified after Sanders threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns in his debut. While veteran Joe Flacco is considered the likely starter, Sanders' performance has created a compelling competition for the position.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant surge, with Bitcoin climbing to nearly $120,000, just shy of its all-time high, and Ether surpassing the $4,000 mark to reach its highest price since December 2021. The rally has been largely attributed to strong buying during Asian trading hours, fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which analysts believe is driving investment into hard assets. This upward momentum has also boosted the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Analysts suggest Bitcoin's next major resistance level is now at $133,000.

          <p>After a significant rally that saw gold prices climb from around $2,000 to over $3,400 per ounce, the momentum has recently slowed, prompting questions about its future trajectory. Several precious metals experts believe the surge is not over, citing strong structural support from institutional and central bank buying, which is at a record pace. They argue that gold remains a crucial diversifier and a hedge against economic uncertainty and currency debasement. While short-term dips are possible, the consensus among the quoted experts is that the long-term trend for gold prices remains upward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a notable shift for Malawian politics, several presidential candidates have selected women as their running mates for the upcoming September 16 election. This trend follows advocacy from civil society groups like the 50-50 Campaign, which pushes for greater gender representation in a country where women constitute a majority of registered voters. However, some analysts are cautious, noting that most of these female candidates are with smaller parties, suggesting the move may be more strategic than a fundamental shift toward gender inclusion. Former president Joyce Banda is the only woman running as a presidential candidate herself.</p>

For example, some 6-month and 1-year CDs are offering APYs around 4.40%, significantly outpacing inflation. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. To maximize savings, the article suggests looking at online banks, considering short-term CDs, and potentially using a laddering strategy to balance high rates with long-term savings goals.

          <p>With popular travel credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve increasing annual fees and others like Capital One and American Express tightening lounge access rules, experts recommend consumers re-evaluate their value. Analysts stress that high annual fees are only worthwhile if the benefits are fully utilized. Before applying, consumers should determine if a general travel card or a brand-specific one better suits their habits. Crucially, experts warn that carrying a balance on these cards will quickly diminish the value of any rewards, as they often come with higher-than-average interest rates.</p>

For liquid savings like emergency funds, high-yield savings accounts currently offer up to 4.35% APY, though these rates are variable.

The initiative follows a coroner's report that called the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight.
