        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, minimum salaries are being implemented in the top two tiers of professional women's football in England, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2. While the specific salary amount has not been disclosed, it is described as a "full-time wage" and is part of a broader effort by WSL Football to professionalize the sport further. The new requirements also include enhanced criteria for high-performance environments, wellbeing support, and safeguarding measures for players. This move aims to eliminate the need for players to hold part-time jobs and to standardize professional conditions across the leagues.</p>

          <p>Macy's reported second-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded Wall Street predictions, attributing the strong performance to successful sales trends at its revamped stores. The department store operator posted adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share, well above the 18 cents expected, with revenue also beating forecasts at $4.81 billion. Citing this positive momentum, the company raised its full-year guidance for both earnings and sales. This optimistic outlook marks a notable turnaround from the previous quarter when Macy's had reduced its forecast due to economic uncertainties, including potential impacts from tariffs.

          <p>A new documentary podcast, "The Quarterback and the Con Artist," details the harrowing ordeal of former NFL quarterback Erik Kramer. After a suicide attempt in 2015 left him with diminished mental capacity, a woman he had previously dated re-entered his life, secretly married him, and systematically stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from his life savings. Kramer, who has since recovered, eventually brought his abuser to justice, though she received a light sentence. Now, he dedicates his time to speaking about mental health and depression, drawing from his extraordinary story of survival and resilience.</p>

          <p>After decades of dangerous landslides and costly temporary repairs, California's transportation department has proposed a permanent solution for the treacherous "Last Chance Grade" section of Highway 101. The plan involves constructing a 6,000-foot, $2.1 billion tunnel through the redwood forest to bypass the eroding coastal cliffs. This three-mile stretch is the only viable route connecting Del Norte County to the rest of the state, making its stability critical for the local economy and emergency services. While funding for the massive project is still being secured, officials emphasize its necessity, arguing that if a similar issue affected a major urban highway, it would have been fixed long ago.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," pop icon Debbie Gibson reflects on her four-decade career, from her meteoric rise as a teenage singer-songwriter-producer to her recent resurgence. Gibson credits her late mother and manager, Diane, for fiercely advocating for her creative control in a male-dominated industry, paving the way for future female artists like Taylor Swift. The book delves into the pressures of fame, including stalkers and panic attacks, as well as her experiences on Broadway and her decision to pose for Playboy. Now 54, Gibson continues to tour independently and plans to create new music and develop projects for musical theater.</p>

          <p>Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry discusses her enduring influence on music and fashion, her new clothing line collaboration with Wildfang, and the band's forthcoming album, "High Noon." The style icon reflects on her DIY approach to fashion and her philosophy of breaking rules, a principle she also applies to Blondie's genre-blending music. Harry emphasizes that creativity stems from soul and passion, elements she believes artificial intelligence cannot replicate, and shares that the new album will continue the band's tradition of embodying different styles and moods. She remains motivated by the artistic process and the continuous search for authentic expression.</p>

          <p>Independent concert promoter Sid the Cat is set to open a new 500-capacity music venue this fall in a restored historic elementary school auditorium in South Pasadena. The opening of the Sid the Cat Auditorium is seen as a sign of hope for the local arts community, which was deeply affected by the destructive Eaton fire that tore through the nearby musician-heavy neighborhood of Altadena. The promoters, who funded the project independently, aim to provide a unique, artist-friendly space with modern amenities in a historic setting. The venue is expected to become a vital hub for musicians and audiences in northeast Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld's Fox News show, "Gutfeld!," has become the most-watched program in its 10 p.m. time slot, attracting over 3 million nightly viewers with its irreverent and conservative-leaning humor. Gutfeld argues that mainstream late-night shows alienated a large portion of the country by becoming too politically one-sided and negative, creating an opportunity he was happy to seize. He attributes his success, along with that of "The Five," to a panel dynamic focused on playful teasing and unpredictability rather than outrage. By prioritizing fun over anger, Gutfeld believes he is providing an alternative that was missing from the late-night landscape.</p>

          <p>The personal wardrobe of the late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, crafted entirely by herself over 80 years, is being shared publicly for the first time. Hurtado developed a signature utilitarian uniform, typically a boxy, four-pocket shirt, which she adapted with various fabrics and details throughout her life. Her journey into dressmaking began out of necessity when she was dissatisfied with available maternity clothes, but it evolved into a core part of her daily practice of intentional living and self-expression. This collection of self-made garments offers a unique insight into the artist who gained mainstream recognition late in her nearly 100-year life.</p>

          <p>The prospect of human settlement on Mars faces a major obstacle: the significant health risks posed by space travel, such as radiation exposure, muscle loss, and psychological stress. The emerging field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, but progress is hampered by the small, unrepresentative sample size of current astronauts. Research, like NASA's twin study, has revealed profound physiological changes caused by microgravity. Advances in this field, from AI-guided diagnostics to creating organoid "avatars" for testing, are not only vital for deep space exploration but also yield significant benefits for healthcare on Earth.</p>

          <p>As freshwater scarcity increases globally, desalination technology is becoming more common, but its environmental impact, particularly the disposal of highly salty brine, remains a concern. The article explores methods to make the process more sustainable, such as diluting the brine with additional seawater before discharge, as practiced at a large plant in California. Other innovative approaches treat the brine as a resource, with projects underway to mine it for valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium. Additionally, experts are developing models to identify optimal locations for new plants that can be powered by renewable energy, further reducing their ecological footprint.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google, notably deciding that the company will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser. The ruling also permits Google to continue its lucrative arrangement of paying companies like Apple to be the default search engine on their devices, though it does place new restrictions on exclusive contracts. This outcome is viewed as a major victory for the tech giant, removing a significant legal overhang and prompting a 6% rise in Alphabet's premarket stock price as investor confidence grew.
