          <p>England's women's cricket team maintained their undefeated streak in the World Cup with an 89-run victory against Sri Lanka. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a century with 117 runs, while Sophie Ecclestone delivered a remarkable bowling performance, taking four wickets for just 17 runs. Despite an early injury to their captain, Sri Lanka showed some resistance but ultimately fell short, being bowled out for 164. The win places England at the top of the tournament's eight-team table.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through London in April 2024, has been retired to a sanctuary. The horse sustained a broken bone and significant injuries after being spooked by construction noise, an incident that also injured several soldiers and civilians. Due to the severity of his injuries, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson has led the Las Vegas Aces to their third WNBA title in four years, capping a season of unprecedented individual achievement. She became the first player in WNBA or NBA history to win the scoring title, MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP in the same season. Wilson's leadership was crucial in turning around the team's difficult mid-season performance, which saw them at a .500 record before a 16-game winning streak. Her dominance on both ends of the court has firmly placed her in the conversation for the greatest player of all time.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan hinges on the SNP winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election. This approach was chosen over an alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum on independence itself. Swinney argued his strategy is the most realistic path forward, though UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously stated he would not approve a new vote.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, often referred to as Gen Z, are pushing back against the trend of "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items not built to last. Citing environmental concerns over the massive carbon footprint and waste generated by discarded decor, they are increasingly turning to secondhand marketplaces. This shift reflects a desire for sustainability, affordability, and a deeper emotional connection to their belongings. The trend challenges the business models of large retailers that promote seasonal styles and disposable goods.</p>

          <p>The commander of U.S. Central Command, Admiral Brad Cooper, visited the Gaza Strip to discuss "post-conflict stabilization" following the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He was accompanied by former White House senior advisor Jared Kushner and envoy Steve Witkoff. The visit occurred as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians began returning to their homes, many of which are in ruins. This development is part of the initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, though significant challenges remain for rebuilding and governance.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held what was described as a "very productive" phone call regarding a potential peace process for Ukraine. Zelenskyy stated he urged Trump to help end the war with Russia and also discussed bolstering Ukraine's air defense capabilities following recent attacks on its energy grid. This call reflects a significant warming of relations between the two leaders since earlier in the year. A White House official confirmed the call took place but did not provide further details.</p>

          <p>A potential historic peace agreement between Israel and Hamas has been brokered with significant influence from U.S. President Donald Trump, according to political analysis. Observers argue that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reliance on American support made him susceptible to pressure from Trump, leading to a breakthrough. As American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, the U.S. president's role became pivotal in pushing the parties toward a deal to end the war in Gaza. The durability of the agreement remains a key question.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America, seeing it as a viable pathway to advance their careers and gain national team recognition. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek have found that the league's quality and visibility provide a strong alternative to traditional moves to European leagues. The trend also extends to coaching and staff roles, offering professional opportunities that are sometimes limited in Australia's domestic A-League. This shift is changing perceptions of MLS within the Australian football community.</p>

Others, like New York's Metrograph, have found success as for-profit ventures by offering a premium experience with a restaurant, bar, and bookstore. These strategies aim to counter the rise of streaming by emphasizing the unique social experience of moviegoing.</p>
