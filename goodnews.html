          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck in the Drake Passage, triggering a tsunami warning for Chile's Magallanes region and parts of the Chilean Antarctic Territory, as well as precautionary measures in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego. Thousands were evacuated to higher ground, including residents of Puerto Williams and Puerto Natales in Chile, and approximately 2,000 people from the Argentine coastline. Chilean President Gabriel Boric called for evacuation of the coastline, and authorities advised residents to remain in safety zones. There have been no reports of damage or injuries so far, and Chile is frequently affected by earthquakes due to its location at the convergence of three tectonic plates.</p>

Cramer believes Amazon will be a dominant retailer, especially if the economy weakens, and recommends buying the stock at its current discounted price. While Apple reported a sales beat for its products, its services business missed expectations and is facing multiple lawsuits.

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 has achieved a record-breaking 15-day winning streak, outperforming global markets gripped by turbulence from U.S. tariff policies. The index has gained over 5% since the start of the year, driven by defensive giants like healthcare and energy, and supported by a high dividend yield. Analysts suggest the UK's neutral trade status and robust corporate results have contributed to the rally, with potential for further gains if defensive stocks remain in favor. However, risks such as geopolitical tensions, revived tariffs, and a stronger pound could impact the index's upward momentum.</p>

This is the first time scientists have observed an active eruption along the 40,000-mile mid-ocean ridge, offering a unique opportunity to study the creation of new seafloor and its impact on ocean chemistry and marine life.

The researchers found that two powerful antibodies from Friede's blood, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species.

Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for a complete repeal or a higher deduction limit, which could be possible given a slim House Republican majority. While Trump initially enacted the $10,000 SALT cap, he has since expressed support for restoring the deduction. (not investment advice)</p>
