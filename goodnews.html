        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. The article provides advice from Dr. Purvi Parikh on managing seasonal allergies, including starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing, which is highest in the mornings and late afternoons. Parikh also advises consulting a doctor if symptoms persist, as they could be due to colds or viruses. Staying informed and taking preventative measures can help individuals better navigate allergy season. The article also notes that different plants and trees release pollen at different times, so symptoms can vary depending on location.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Plug-in Hybrid Exports Surge in UK Amid Electric Vehicle Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports have experienced a significant surge. In the first quarter of the year, plug-in hybrid exports increased by nearly 600%, with a notable 1,849% increase in March alone. This trend is attributed to the UK's relatively lower import tariffs on Chinese cars compared to the European Union, making them a more affordable option for consumers. One Londoner shared that he chose a Chinese EV due to its affordability compared to Tesla. The UK is now China's second-largest export destination for EVs and fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that mothers should cut themselves some slack and stop striving for perfection. She explains that psychiatrists have historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, which harms children by making them think mental health professionals will blame their parents. Ross encourages mothers to acknowledge their flaws and recognize that those imperfections are essential for children to learn acceptance. The article also includes a lighthearted quiz to help mothers realize they don't need to be perfect.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, responding to calls from Ukraine and its allies for a 30-day ceasefire or face additional sanctions. Putin referenced unsuccessful 2022 talks in Istanbul and expressed a commitment to serious negotiations, suggesting a ceasefire could be agreed upon during these talks. This proposal follows threats from European leaders to increase pressure on Moscow if a ceasefire is not accepted, with support from President Trump. Zelenskyy has stated his readiness for peace talks but only after a ceasefire is in place.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained stable at 6.76%, near its highest levels this year, while 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a mediocre start to the spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. declined in March, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, was released from an immigration detention center after being held for over six weeks following her arrest for co-authoring an op-ed criticizing the university's response to the conflict in Gaza. A federal judge ordered her release, finding that she had raised substantial claims that her rights were violated. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and vowed to continue her case in court, asserting her faith in the American justice system.

          <p>A new report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested approximately $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with China's global trend of moving away from fossil fuels and focusing on renewable energy sources, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
