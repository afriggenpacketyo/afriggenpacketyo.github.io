        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta is reportedly in talks to hire Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and Nat Friedman, former CEO of GitHub, as part of Mark Zuckerberg's ongoing AI talent acquisition efforts. This move follows Meta's unsuccessful attempt to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, and their recent $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI to bring on Alexandr Wang. The aggressive pursuit of AI experts highlights the intensifying competition among tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI to develop advanced large language models and achieve artificial general intelligence. The hirings also involve Meta acquiring a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm run by Gross and Friedman. Optimism surrounding Meta's future AI development remains cautiously high.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge ruled in favor of 20 Democratic-led states, finding they were likely to succeed on their claims that the policy was unlawful. The states argued the administration was using federal funds to coerce them into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda. The lawsuit challenged the transportation secretary's authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress.

Fee-based policies were found to be more effective than full bans, while partial bans were the least effective. The study also suggests that plastic bag laws may reduce harm to marine life.
