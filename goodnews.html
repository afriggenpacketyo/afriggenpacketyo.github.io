          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, asserting that crypto has a champion in the Trump administration. Vance, a longstanding crypto backer, emphasized the administration's aim to ease regulations and mainstream digital assets. He urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, viewing them as a force multiplier for the economy. Vance encouraged continued political involvement from the crypto community, highlighting the industry's role as a hedge against inflation and discriminatory policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating. This change could ease installations for millions of homes in England, particularly terraced houses. Consumer groups caution that this doesn't address issues for renters or leaseholders, and high upfront costs remain a barrier. The change is part of the Warm Homes Plan, aiming to improve energy efficiency and lower bills, but funding and better insulation are still needed for older homes.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% increase in revenue, reaching $44.1 billion, despite new U.S. restrictions on AI chip sales to China. The company's net income rose 26% to $18.78 billion, though it fell short of profit predictions. The Trump administration's restrictions on chips to China will cost Nvidia $4.5 billion, less than initially estimated. Nvidia projected a 50% revenue increase in the current quarter, driven by sales of its newest AI chip, Blackwell. (not investment advice)</p>
