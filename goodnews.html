          <p>Egypt's foreign minister has assured Greece that Egypt is committed to preserving the spiritual and religious significance of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a part of the Greek Orthodox church. The reassurance came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's ownership claims to the land it sits on. While the court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites, it ruled the land was public, prompting Greece to seek guarantees for the site's protection. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated the ruling would not affect the site's spiritual value and religious standing, with both countries agreeing to cooperate on protecting the monastery's rights and legal status.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there, has been flown back to the US following a judge's order. The order came after the Justice Department admitted that its claim that OCG had stated he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information. OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after being attacked multiple times in homophobic acts of violence in Guatemala. He stated that he has been living in hiding, in constant panic and fear since his deportation.</p>

          <p>Zoe Salda√±a has revealed that she "collapsed" immediately following her Oscar win for "Emilia P√©rez," citing physical exhaustion and a cold. The actor explained that her body had been running on adrenaline for months during awards season, leading to a collapse once it was over. Salda√±a's victory capped an impressive awards season, but the film itself faced criticism for its portrayal of transgender issues and Mexico. Other cast and crew members, including Karla Sof√≠a Gasc√≥n and director Jacques Audiard, also faced negative press.</p>

          <p>Amazon has formed a new group within its consumer product-development arm, Lab126, focused on agentic artificial intelligence. The team will develop an agentic AI "framework" for use in its robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI." These systems will enable robots to "hear, understand and act on natural language commands, turning warehouse robots into flexible, multi-talented assistants." Amazon's AI lab released a web browser-based agent earlier this year, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group.</p>
