          <p>Rice prices in Japan have surged, more than doubling in May and marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar increases in April and March. This spike in rice prices coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023. Marcella Chow from JP Morgan Asset Management notes that rice accounts for about 50% of Japan's core inflation, making future inflation trends heavily reliant on food prices. The Bank of Japan held rates at 0.5% after its monetary policy meeting, but Governor Kazuo Ueda indicated that the central bank will continue to raise rates once there is more confidence that underlying inflation will approach 2%.

          <p>China maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. Last month, authorities cut lending rates for the first time since October, aiming to cushion the impact from trade tensions with Washington. Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling supports a lawsuit brought by 20 states, arguing that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. Judge John McConnell stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal transportation funds.

          <p>Eric Dane, who is battling ALS, attended a premiere with filmmaker Janell Shirtcliff, creating confusion about his relationship status. Despite being legally married to Rebecca Gayheart, who supports him, Dane has been reportedly dating Shirtcliff on and off for three years. Adding to the confusion, another actor, Priya Jain, claims to be Dane's exclusive partner, having spent significant time with him recently. This situation is reminiscent of Dane's past controversy involving a nude bathtub video with Gayheart and another actor.</p>

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being reimagined as a space for healing, art, and reparative history. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation is collaborating with 1504, a narrative studio, to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities. The project includes an exhibit called "Out of Whole Cloth," showcasing the stories of free Black families after Emancipation. The initiative aims to connect with a new generation by presenting history as a shared human experience.</p>
