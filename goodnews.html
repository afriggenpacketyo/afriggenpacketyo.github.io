          <p>Lawmakers in California and Texas are engaged in a political battle over congressional redistricting, with Missouri joining the fray, and this dispute could significantly impact the balance of power in Washington DC. Texas Republicans initiated the conflict by redrawing districts to favor their party, prompting California Democrats to respond in kind. Missouri then convened a special session to redraw maps, aiming to secure an additional Republican seat, and President Trump has urged Republican-controlled states to redraw districts to maintain control of Congress. The legal battles and political maneuvering highlight the partisan intentions behind redistricting efforts. This redistricting could have significant implications for the 2026 midterms.

          <p>The CDC has issued a warning for travelers to China due to an outbreak of chikungunya in Guangdong Province, a mosquito-borne virus that causes fever and joint pain. The CDC recommends travelers practice enhanced precautions, including using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants, and the CDC also suggests travelers get vaccinated, though pregnant women are urged to reconsider travel to the affected areas, as newborns can face severe illness if infected. Chinese officials have responded aggressively to the outbreak, and joint pain caused by the virus can be severe and prolonged. Severe symptoms and death are rare and usually occur in babies, the elderly and people with underlying conditions. The optimism score is not directly related to the content of the article.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to expand fast-track deportations throughout the U.S., citing due process concerns, and the ruling is a setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts. The judge paused a January directive that had expanded the expedited removal policy to anywhere in the country and to those who arrived in the past two years, which allowed immigration officials to quickly deport certain migrants without allowing them to see an immigration judge. The judge said the pro-immigrant advocates had made a "strong showing" that the effort "violates the due process rights of those it affects."

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh have set a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, completing the 9,000-mile journey in 140 days. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean faced violent tropical storms, with Lachlan even being swept overboard during one storm but pulled back into the boat. The brothers beat the previous record of 162 days and have raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. They had to ration their supplies in the final weeks and are looking forward to pizza and a good night's sleep. The optimism score is not directly related to the content of the article.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway has reopened after being closed for years due to storm damage, which includes slope failures, rock slides, and collapsed pavement. The repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, erosion control, and drainage systems. The reopening provides access to popular hiking trails and is expected to reduce littering and overcrowding, though there are concerns about increased fire danger over Labor Day weekend. The U.S. Forest Service has announced heightened fire danger warnings for the area, prohibiting campfires and open flames.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked Donald Trump’s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have permission to live and work in the US, saying that plaintiffs are likely to win their claim that the president’s administration’s actions were unlawful. The court upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while TPS holders challenge actions by the Republican president’s administration in court. The judges found that homeland security secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of TPS.

Since the pandemic, school absence has almost doubled, and data shows that just 10 days of absence can halve the chance of a student getting at least a grade 5 in English and Maths.
