          <p>Harvard University researchers have identified a rare 1300 version of the Magna Carta in its collection, initially believed to be a cheap copy purchased for $27.50. The document, issued by King Edward I, is one of only seven known copies and is estimated to be worth millions. Researchers confirmed its authenticity by comparing it to other copies using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a World War I flying ace who inherited it from anti-slave trade campaigners, highlighting its historical significance and relevance to contemporary debates on governmental authority and individual liberty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy evolves and policy remains in flux. He noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, including a period of surging inflation that led to aggressive interest rate hikes. Powell suggested that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, with higher real rates reflecting potentially more volatile inflation due to frequent supply shocks. He has recently highlighted that tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation, although the extent of the impact is difficult to predict.</p>

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey indicated that price hikes are likely to begin later this month due to tariffs, even with recent agreements to lower duties on imports from China. Despite beating quarterly earnings expectations, Walmart noted that tariffs remain too high for retailers to absorb, potentially impacting consumers. The company expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies. Walmart is working with vendors to mitigate price increases and maintain competitive pricing, but acknowledges the unprecedented speed and magnitude of the changes.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, primarily from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Some representatives from suburban districts are pushing for the cap to be abolished or raised significantly, while others support a more modest increase to $30,000. The issue is particularly sensitive for Republicans in high-tax states, where voters are concerned about double taxation and fairness. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved, with talks expected to continue.</p>

Despite investments in AI and core e-commerce, analysts' high expectations were not met, partly due to macroeconomic volatility and US-China trade tensions.

          <p>Germany is backing U.S. President Donald Trump's call to increase NATO members' defense spending target to 5% of their GDP, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. Wadephul indicated that this stance aligns with Trump's belief in the necessary level of defense expenditure. While NATO chief Mark Rutte has proposed a 3.5% target for defense spending and an additional 1.5% for broader security matters, Germany supports the overall 5% goal. This move signifies a shift towards increased military commitment from Germany, with plans to become the conventionally strongest military in Europe.</p>
