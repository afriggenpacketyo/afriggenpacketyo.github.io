        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card debt in the U.S., this article examines the limits of debt settlement as a relief strategy. While there is no official cap, experts suggest that settlement becomes less effective for debts exceeding $100,000. For such large amounts, creditors are less willing to negotiate, the required lump-sum payments become unrealistic for most individuals, and professional fees can become prohibitively expensive. The article advises that debt settlement is often best suited for those with $7,500 to $75,000 in unsecured debt, and it outlines alternatives for more overwhelming situations.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to uphold a Texas law that mandates age verification for visitors to websites containing substantial pornographic material. The law requires sites to confirm users are at least 18, a measure challenged by the Free Speech Coalition as a violation of First Amendment rights for adults. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority, stating the law is a constitutionally permissible exercise of the state's authority to protect children from sexually explicit content.

          <p>A new book, "Toni at Random," and a related essay highlight Toni Morrison's influential career as a book editor at Random House before she achieved global fame as a novelist. During the 1970s, Morrison championed a generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali, insisting on their uncompromising vision while ensuring their work met the highest literary standards. She resisted pressure to make their writing more palatable for white audiences, believing that powerful stories written for a specific community could achieve universal appeal. Her work as an editor fundamentally changed publishing by creating a mainstream market for Black literature.</p>

The personal saving rate has risen significantly this year, and trends like "no buy" challenges are gaining popularity on social media. Financial experts note that this cautious behavior is a shift from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government has found the "right balance" on welfare reform after making significant concessions to his own party's MPs. The initial plan to tighten eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefit faced a large-scale rebellion within the Labour Party. In response, the government will now apply the stricter criteria only to new claimants, maintain inflation-linked increases for existing Universal Credit recipients, and fast-track a support-to-work package. The U-turn represents a major political climbdown to quell internal dissent over the controversial cost-saving measures.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," details the early life of conservative intellectual William F. Buckley, Jr. The text describes his father's career as an oil speculator who, after being expelled from Mexico, rebuilt his fortune in Venezuela and established the family on a large estate in Sharon, Connecticut. It paints a picture of Buckley's childhood at "Great Elm," a bustling household with ten children and numerous staff. This upbringing in a devoutly Catholic and fiercely anti-establishment family is presented as the foundation for the conservative movement he would later lead.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Rejects Challenge to Obamacare's Preventive Care Task Force</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 11:15:47 EDT</div>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a key provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), ruling 6-3 in favor of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This task force determines which preventive health services, such as cancer screenings and certain medications, insurers must cover at no cost to patients. The challenge was brought by a group of Christian-owned businesses arguing the task force's structure was unconstitutional. The decision is a significant victory for public health advocates, preserving no-cost access to a wide range of preventive care for approximately 150 million Americans.</p>
