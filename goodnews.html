        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed course, allowing construction to resume on the Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island. This decision comes a month after a highly unusual stop-work order threatened the $5 billion project's collapse. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she pressed President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lift the hold, emphasizing the project's importance. The project, being built by Equinor, is expected to power 500,000 New York homes, and the reversal saves over 1,000 jobs among workers from parts of New York that supported him. The Trump administration had previously halted work, citing concerns that the permits had been rushed, however it never shared evidence of its claims with either the company or the public.</p>

          <p>Middleton High School in Wisconsin is experiencing a resurgence in trade classes, driven by the high demand and lucrative salaries for skilled tradespeople. The school built a $90 million campus in 2022, highlighting the importance of technical education, which is part of a larger trend of increased spending on technical education in 27 states. Students are now more interested in trades as a pathway to well-paying jobs, with some blue-collar positions earning six-figure salaries. The school offers courses in woodworking, welding, and robotics, preparing students for immediate employment after graduation, challenging the traditional emphasis on a four-year college degree.</p>

          <p>House Republicans plan to vote this week on President Trump's second term agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, despite persistent divisions within the GOP conference. President Trump is expected to visit House Republicans to urge support for the bill, as fractures remain over issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to build consensus between hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates reluctant to slash Medicaid, aiming to pass the bill before the Memorial Day recess. The legislation faces potential resistance in the Senate, where some Republicans have warned they will seek changes.</p>

          <p>A Lufthansa plane flew for approximately 10 minutes without a pilot when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit, according to a report from Spain's Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility. The incident occurred during a flight from Frankfurt to Seville in February 2024, when the captain could not re-enter the cockpit after the co-pilot suffered a sudden medical emergency. The plane's autopilot remained engaged during the period without pilot supervision, and the captain eventually regained access to the cockpit and diverted the plane to Madrid, where it landed safely.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned three ancient artworks to the Republic of Iraq after determining they were looted. The artworks, including a Sumerian vessel and two Babylonian ceramic sculptures, were recovered following criminal investigations into looted art, particularly involving the British antiquities dealer Robin Symes. The artifacts were returned in an official ceremony attended by Met officials and representatives from Iraq. The Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office said the investigation into Symes led to the seizure of 135 antiquities trafficked through Manhattan, valued at $58 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the dissemination of AI-created "deepfakes." The bill, championed by First Lady Melania Trump, makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent and requires websites to remove such content within 48 hours. While receiving bipartisan support, the measure has faced criticism from free speech advocates who argue it is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images and undermine due process.</p>

          <p>Jeff deGraaf, Renaissance Macro's chairman, identifies a "20-day high thrust" as an "escape velocity" signal indicating a robust stock market recovery and a potential bull market. This indicator, triggered when over 20% of S&P 500 stocks hit 20-day highs, suggests that the market has reached a sustainable bottom. Historically, the stock market has rallied an average of 16% 12 months after this signal, although pullbacks of around 10% are common. DeGraaf also notes that a rising number of bulls compared to bears is a positive sign, and he is looking for a higher percentage of stocks above their 20-day moving average to confirm the market's health.</p>
