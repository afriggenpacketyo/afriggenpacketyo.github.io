          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the longtime congressman from Harlem, passed away at the age of 94, leaving behind a significant legacy in the community he represented for over four decades.

He served as the first Black chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, though his career was marked by ethical lapses that led to his censure.

          <p>A growing number of small-scale distillers in Japan are producing craft gins with homegrown ingredients, contributing to a domestic gin boom. These distillers are using local specialties to create unique flavors, such as bitter gourd from Okinawa and camellia flowers from the Goto Islands. The flexibility of gin production, which doesn't require aging, allows for quick monetization and encourages shochu and whiskey makers to utilize existing facilities. The trend has also spurred the rise of gin-dedicated bars and e-commerce sites, with major manufacturers joining the market by releasing canned gin products.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches to understand the acoustics of spaceflight and mitigate noise disruptions to communities. With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, particularly by SpaceX, the noise pollution from both the initial roar and returning sonic booms has become a concern. Researchers are analyzing the complex ways sound waves travel, aiming to inform regulations and minimize disturbances. This research is becoming increasingly important as SpaceX tests Starship, the largest and potentially loudest rocket ever built, with the goal of frequent launches.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor, surpassed by Germany, despite its net external assets reaching a record high. Japan's gross external assets rose significantly due to a weaker yen, but Germany's substantial current account surplus allowed it to take the lead. Japan's net external credit increased for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States. The United States, in contrast, has a net external liability, with its foreign debts exceeding its overseas assets.</p>
