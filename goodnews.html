          <p>NHS England plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate pressure on accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, offering specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England believes this pioneering model of care will ensure people receive appropriate support in the right setting, while reducing overcrowding in hospitals. However, some experts remain skeptical, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national implementation.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna placement during construction of a new control tower. The FAA ordered the aborted landings out of caution, raising concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial planes. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address safety issues, while the NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media rather than directly to the agency.</p>

He argues that Japan's increasingly severe security environment and the potential for AI to become a bargaining chip in a deglobalized world necessitate a focus on domestic AI capabilities. Sakana AI, which secured an award at a defense innovation competition, sees growth potential in collaborating with the Japanese government on defense-related AI solutions.

          <p>Ahead of the UK's ban on disposable vapes on June 1, many vapers are stockpiling the devices, fearing the loss of convenience and taste. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, but some ex-smokers worry about returning to cigarettes. Retailers have seen sales of disposable vapes surge as customers stock up, while concerns arise about the availability of preferred flavors and the potential for a black market. The government hopes the ban will encourage the use of rechargeable vapes, but some argue it will negatively impact public health by removing an effective smoking cessation tool.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp., reversing his previous opposition to the deal. The move follows a review by federal agencies and a promise by the companies to create at least 70,000 jobs and contribute $14 billion to the American economy. The acquisition, which faced scrutiny over national security concerns, had been blocked by the Biden administration. Both steelmakers praised the decision, with Nippon Steel stating it would be a "remarkable turning point" for the U.S. steel industry.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his upcoming tour dates, including concerts scheduled up to July 2026, after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, exacerbated by recent performances, has led to issues with his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing while he undergoes physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. NPH, characterized by fluid buildup in the brain, can cause cognitive and mobility issues, but is typically treatable with surgery.</p>

          <p>A 440-foot cargo ship ran aground in Norway, coming within feet of a wooden cabin as its owner slept. The helmsman of the NCL Salten was reportedly asleep at the time of the incident, failing to change course as it entered the Trondheim fjord. The ship caused damage to a heating pipe in the cabin, but the homeowner was unharmed. Norwegian police have launched an investigation, and the shipping company is conducting internal inquiries. This is reportedly the same ship ran aground twice before.</p>
