The industrial firm surpassed sales and earnings expectations, driven by significant profit margin expansion and better-than-expected cash flow. Management also raised its full-year guidance and reaffirmed the November 1 spin-off date for its electronics business, Qnity. The club believes the stock's muted reaction to the positive news presents a valuable buying opportunity ahead of the company's upcoming breakup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the FBI reveals that crime rates in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including violent crime, murder, and property crime. This marks the continuation of a downward trend from a spike observed after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the murder rate falling for the second consecutive year. Notably, motor vehicle thefts saw a significant 18.6% drop, the largest one-year decrease ever recorded for that category. While experts credit various factors, including community intervention programs, they also note that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

        </div>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt remaining at historically high levels, financial experts are offering guidance on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness. To improve the chances of creditors agreeing to accept less than the full amount owed, individuals should first organize their finances and review their credit reports. It is crucial to document evidence of financial hardship, such as job loss or medical bills, as this strengthens the case for settlement. Finally, experts recommend either contacting creditors directly or working with a reputable debt settlement firm, ensuring any final agreement is put in writing.</p>

          <p>Chemical giants Chemours, DuPont, and Corteva have agreed to a settlement with the state of New Jersey, committing to pay $875 million over 25 years. The agreement resolves environmental claims, including pollution from PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," which do not easily break down and are linked to serious health problems. This settlement follows over $11 billion in similar agreements made in 2023 regarding PFAS contamination of U.S. drinking water. The payments are scheduled to begin in 2026, with Chemours covering half the cost, addressing a growing wave of litigation over the widespread chemical contamination.</p>

Speaking to CNBC, Trump confirmed he has a list of four potential candidates to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. While he did not name the contenders, likely candidates include former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. The announcement follows the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a member to the board. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining relatively high, savers are considering whether to lock in long-term rates or maintain flexibility with short-term options. Currently, short-term CDs are offering slightly higher yields than long-term ones, an "inverted curve" that often signals market expectations of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Financial experts advise that the choice depends on individual goals; short-term CDs suit those needing access to funds soon, while long-term CDs can lock in current high rates for predictable income. For those unsure, a CD ladder strategy can provide a balance of both benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45 to 49 is linked to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates in this group grew 62% from 2019 to 2023. This corresponded with a sharp rise in the detection of localized, more curable cancers. Experts call the findings promising news, as removing precancerous polyps during a colonoscopy can prevent cancer from developing, though they caution that screening rates in this younger demographic remain suboptimal.</p>

An analysis points to the company's strong focus on leadership development and its massive global footprint as key factors in producing a long line of successful CEOs for rival chains. Alumni include Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, Brinker International CEO Kevin Hochman, and Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino. The company's deep talent pool often means that high-performing executives must look externally to secure a top CEO position, further spreading Yum's influence.</p>

The list includes food from damaged cans, which may contain the botulism neurotoxin, and certain large tropical reef fish that can carry ciguatoxin. The other two are undercooked pork, which poses a risk for neurocysticercosis from tapeworm eggs, and unpasteurized milk, a known source of dangerous pathogens.
