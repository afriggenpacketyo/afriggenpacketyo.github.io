          <p>Australia's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), held its benchmark policy rate steady at 3.6% on Tuesday, aligning with market expectations. This decision comes as the country faces its highest inflation rate in over a year, reaching 3% in August, primarily driven by increases in housing, food, and alcohol costs. RBA Governor Michelle Bullock acknowledged a "clouded by uncertainty" economic outlook, despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter. The central bank's focus remains on curbing inflation while navigating global economic unpredictability.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas gold-mining arm of China's state-owned Zijin Mining, saw its shares surge over 60% on its Hong Kong trading debut. The company raised nearly HKD$25 billion (approximately $3.2 billion) in what became the world's second-largest IPO this year. This successful listing capitalizes on gold's recent record highs, driven by safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainty. The debut builds on a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, highlighting strong investor interest in the gold sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan has garnered welcome from leaders across the Middle East and Europe, though Hamas has been warned to accept the terms or face consequences. The proposal outlines an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and a future Gaza without Hamas governance. It also leaves open the possibility for an eventual Palestinian state and includes an "economic development plan" for rebuilding Gaza. Former UK PM Sir Tony Blair is slated to co-chair an international "Board of Peace" to oversee the transition.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese grocery retailers, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are embracing discount tactics akin to European chains like Aldi and Lidl to attract increasingly price-sensitive shoppers. Amid economic uncertainty, these giants are streamlining hypermarkets, reducing brand-name goods, and aggressively promoting their own "private label" lines. This strategy aims to offer comparable quality at lower prices by cutting intermediaries and marketing costs. The shift reflects a growing consumer demand for value-for-money, as sales at China's top retailers stagnated last year. (not investment advice)</p>

Meng, 60, previously moved to Guangdong in 2022 to lead Shenzhen. His appointment is expected to be formally confirmed by the provincial legislature soon, filling the vacancy left by Wang Weizhong. This personnel change follows a monthly Politburo meeting and comes as Shenzhen's economy has faced challenges from the pandemic, property downturn, and the China-US trade war.</p>

The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center, with human interaction minimized to foster natural hunting behaviors. This release is a hopeful development for the "near-threatened" mountain lion population in California, which faces constant risks from human activity and habitat encroachment. The initiative aims to reduce human-wildlife conflict by encouraging the lions to remain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers enter the playoffs with a distinct urgency to secure another World Series title, despite having broken their decades-long drought last year. After an underwhelming regular season, the team aims to overcome past postseason disappointments and recreate the desperation that fueled their last championship run. Manager Dave Roberts notes a significantly improved starting pitching rotation compared to last year, which is crucial given concerns about the bullpen. The team's recent offensive surge and the expected return of key players like Max Muncy and Tommy Edman bolster their confidence for the upcoming wild-card series.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to deliver a pivotal speech at the Labour Party conference, framing Britain as being "at a fork in the road." He will contrast Labour's vision of "renewal" and "decency" against what he describes as the decline and division offered by Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party. Starmer's address aims to inject vigor into his leadership amidst recent political challenges, including ministerial departures and dire opinion polls. He is expected to appeal beyond Labour's traditional base, calling for national unity to rebuild the country and improve living standards.</p>

Reid, who lost a foot in a boat accident, highlights the financial burden and impracticality for amputees who only need one shoe, yet must purchase two. She emphasizes that while brands feature inclusive imagery with bladed athletes, their retail practices don't match. This advocacy extends to thousands of people with different-sized feet, urging retailers to align their inclusivity messaging with their sales policies.</p>

Citing Hong Kong's existing role in international mediation, the article argues the city can strengthen China's engagement with the UN, where China is the second-largest donor, by "bringing the world to China."</p>

          <p>Boeing is reportedly in the early stages of developing a new single-aisle airplane intended to eventually replace the 737 MAX, according to the Wall Street Journal. This development comes as the company continues to recover from the 737 MAX's global grounding in 2019 following two fatal crashes, which led to significant profit losses and regulatory scrutiny. CEO Kelly Ortberg has already met with Rolls-Royce to discuss new engines for the aircraft. While still in the planning phase, this initiative signals Boeing's long-term strategy to move beyond the troubled MAX model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). Judge Royce Lamberth cited "concerning disrespect" from the administration regarding previous orders to restore VOA programming and provide information. The administration, which had previously shut down VOA broadcasts, sought to reduce the agency's functions, but employees argued the cuts would hamper VOA's statutory mission. This ruling preserves the agency's staffing while legal challenges continue.</p>
