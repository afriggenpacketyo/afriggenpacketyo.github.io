          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, following the administration's moves to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. The address comes after West Point disbanded several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers, following the administration's guidance. Critics, including former West Point teachers, have argued that these programs did not hinder the values of the academies, while Trump's supporters claim that such programs were infiltrated by 'Woke Leftist Ideologues.' The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding DEI initiatives within military institutions.</p>

Despite Bashir's success, England's seam bowling was not particularly impressive, allowing Sean Williams to score 88 runs. Harry Brook's spectacular catch was a highlight, and Bashir achieved the milestone of becoming the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets, marking him as a promising talent.</p>
