          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia this week is seen by European observers as lending symbolic weight to the relationship between the two nations, though they acknowledge subsequent developments could be more significant. These observers caution that Beijing faces a challenging balancing act, needing to strengthen ties with Moscow during the Ukraine conflict while also maintaining closer relations with Europe. Xi's itinerary includes attending a May 9 military parade in Red Square, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.

          <p>Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule in football, suggesting that a player should be considered onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is level with the last defender. Wenger compares the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup when the doubt benefits the striker. He believes this change is necessary to restore the advantage to the striker and address the frustration caused by VAR's precision in offside calls.</p>
