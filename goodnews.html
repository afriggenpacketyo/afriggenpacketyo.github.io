          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez are getting married in Venice, drawing a high-profile crowd of celebrities, business leaders, and political figures. Guests including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates were seen attending the pre-nuptial festivities. The lavish event has not been without controversy, however, as the influx of powerful stars has sparked protests from some Venetian locals. A campaign called "No Space for Bezos" has emerged amid broader concerns about over-tourism and rising costs in the historic city.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings from a $10,000 deposit in either a high-yield savings account or a money market account. It calculates that with current top rates being very similar, the difference in earnings over a year is negligible, making both good options for savers. The piece advises savers to choose based on their preference for account features, as both significantly outperform traditional savings accounts and can help their money grow more effectively in the current economic climate.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising consumer debt, this article explores which types of debt are most likely to qualify for forgiveness or settlement. Unsecured debts like credit card balances, personal loans, and medical bills are often negotiable with creditors, as they lack collateral and lenders would rather recover some money than nothing. The article notes that while possible, settling debts from payday loans or buy now, pay later plans can be more challenging due to different regulatory structures and creditor practices that are less favorable to negotiation.

          <p>After qualifying for the Wimbledon main draw, British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, 21, has drawn attention to NCAA rules that limit his ability to claim his full prize money. As a student-athlete at the University of San Diego, he is restricted to earning $10,000 in profit annually plus expenses from professional tournaments. Tarvet expressed his belief that he deserves the earnings from his hard work and that a change in NCAA rules would be beneficial for college athletes competing at a professional level.</p>

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a purposeful return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her youth, set against a New York City backdrop. The article notes the album's focus on themes of desire, confusion, and intense self-reflection during a transitional period in her late 20s. While praising moments of musical magic and her unique conversational cadences, the reviewer finds the album‚Äôs thrill is sometimes muted by self-obsession and production that feels less radical than intended.</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy has reversed its earlier decision to reduce its oil rig count, signaling a more optimistic view of oil markets and the broader economy. The company had previously planned to shift capital from oil to natural gas due to fears of a tariff-driven recession, but now feels a price collapse is less likely. This move to maintain nine oil rigs in the Permian Basin could help the company achieve its long-term production growth goals, though it places capital expenditure spending at the higher end of its guidance.
