          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has announced that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, confirming he will be reincarnated. In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he specified that the search for his successor should follow past traditions and be handled by his Gaden Phodrang Trust, a clear message for China to not interfere. This decision is politically and spiritually momentous for Tibetans who seek to preserve their identity and resist Beijing's attempts to control the succession process.</p>

At a high-level economic meeting, officials used the term "disorderly low-price competition" to characterize the phenomenon, which they believe harms innovation, efficiency, and product quality. The government's goal is to guide companies toward improving their products and to promote the orderly exit of outdated production capacity from the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising NBA free agency development, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To create the necessary cap space for the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star guard Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now become a free agent. This significant roster shake-up repositions both franchises as they prepare for the upcoming season, with Lillard's future destination now a major point of speculation.</p>
