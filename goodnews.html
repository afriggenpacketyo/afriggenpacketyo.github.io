          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has denied any knowledge of an alleged scheme to circumvent the NBA's salary cap involving player Kawhi Leonard and the now-bankrupt company Aspiration, which Ballmer partially funded. The Clippers are accused of funneling $28 million to Leonard through a "no-show" endorsement deal with Aspiration. Ballmer stated he only introduced the deal to Leonard and was unaware of the contract details, expressing that he felt "conned" by Aspiration's co-founder, who has pleaded guilty to fraud. The NBA has initiated an investigation into the matter, potentially impacting the team and player.</p>

          <p>World champions New Zealand secured their place in the Women's Rugby World Cup semi-finals by defeating a determined South Africa side 46-17. Despite a strong start from the Springbok Women, who scored first and leveled the game at halftime, the Black Ferns dominated the second half with five tries. Full-back Renee Holmes and number eight Kaipo Olsen-Baker each scored twice, while teenage wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee also contributed. South Africa's coach praised his team's memorable World Cup campaign, calling it a "giant awakened" in their nation's women's rugby. New Zealand will now face either Canada or Australia in the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>Georgia prosecutors faced a significant setback as a judge dismissed charges against 61 defendants in the "Cop City" RICO case, a two-year attempt to prosecute opposition to the police training center. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer ruled that the attorney general lacked the authority to bring the RICO case without special permission from the governor, which was not obtained. This decision, which dismisses charges in most of the indictment, exposes fundamental flaws in the state's prosecution and is seen as a major failure in using conspiracy charges against a protest movement. The state has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Great Britain's mixed 4x400m relay team failed to secure a podium finish at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, placing fifth despite qualifying with the second-fastest time. This outcome breaks their recent streak of global relay medals, including five at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Team USA won gold, equaling the championship record, with the Netherlands and Belgium taking silver and bronze respectively. Athletes expressed disappointment, with one runner acknowledging they are "here to win medals, we're GB, we're not here to just compete." Jazmin Sawyers also faced disappointment, missing the women's long jump final on her return from injury.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta, the parent company of Instagram, violated a porn star's right to freedom of expression by deleting her Instagram account. The Constitutional Court found that Meta removed Esperanza Gómez's account, which had over five million followers, "without a clear and transparent justification" and inconsistently applied its policies on nudity compared to similar accounts. Gómez argued the closure impacted her livelihood and was influenced by her offline work. The ruling mandates Meta to review and adjust its terms of use and privacy policy for greater clarity and to precisely define rules on implicit sexual content, setting a precedent for social media moderation.</p>

          <p>An article challenges the widely propagated narrative of Americans, particularly children, being "the sickest generation in American history," a claim central to the "Make America Healthy Again" movement. It argues that decades of progress in public health, including vaccines, antibiotics, cleaner environments, and safer workplaces, have significantly extended lifespans and improved overall health compared to previous centuries. While acknowledging modern health challenges like obesity and mental illness, the article emphasizes the importance of historical perspective to avoid catastrophizing the present. It suggests that revolutionary solutions risk undermining the foundations of existing public health achievements, advocating for building upon progress rather than dismantling it.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management is advocating for a merger between Performance Food Group (PFG) and US Foods, arguing for significant potential synergies. Sachem Head, led by Scott Ferguson, has nominated four candidates to PFG's board and urged the company to explore this combination, citing the success of previous activist engagements. The article highlights that a merger of the second and third-largest foodservice distributors could yield $800 million to $1 billion in synergies, a figure supported by past industry consolidation attempts.
