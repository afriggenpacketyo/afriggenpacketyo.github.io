          <p>Germany's women's Bundesliga has expanded to 14 clubs and kicked off its season with a record attendance, signaling growing interest in the sport. The league has secured increased free-to-air broadcast coverage, aiming to boost its visibility and commercial appeal. However, despite these positive steps, concerns remain about the league's competitiveness, which is still dominated by Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg. The article contrasts its development with the more commercially advanced WSL in England and the structurally competitive NWSL in the United States.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mostly higher after the U.S. formalized a reduction in import tariffs on Japanese automobiles from 27.5% to 15%. The executive order also confirmed a significant $550 billion in Japanese investments into U.S. projects, boosting investor confidence. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable jump, and chip stocks in the region also gained following President Trump's remarks about imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms that do not relocate production to the U.S. The developments reflect ongoing shifts in global trade policy.

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The growth was largely attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament, which boosted sales at clothing, footwear, and online retailers. However, the ONS also issued revisions to past data and apologized for errors, admitting to issues with its seasonal adjustment calculations. Despite the monthly rise, the broader trend for the three months to July showed a 0.6% decline, indicating underlying weakness in the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya is in advanced negotiations with the Export-Import Bank of China to refinance its dollar-denominated loans into Chinese yuan. The move is intended to alleviate pressure on Kenya's foreign currency reserves and could significantly lower the interest rate on loans used to finance the Standard Gauge Railway. According to Kenya's Treasury, switching to yuan could halve the interest rate from over 6% to approximately 3%, offering substantial financial relief. This potential agreement highlights a growing trend of using the yuan in international debt and trade arrangements. (not investment advice)</p>
