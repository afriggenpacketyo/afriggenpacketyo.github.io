          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control its entire business ecosystem, highlighted by a new partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerator chips. This strategy aims to create a vertically integrated system, from silicon to software, similar to Apple's approach, giving OpenAI an infrastructure advantage. The company's acquisition of Jony Ive's startup also signals ambitions in consumer hardware, suggesting a future where OpenAI not only powers AI experiences but also owns the devices they run on.

The policy shift is part of a broader principle to "treat adult users like adults" and follows efforts to mitigate mental health risks previously associated with less restrictive content. This move, which could help attract more subscribers, is also expected to increase scrutiny from critics and lawmakers concerned about the effectiveness of age-gating technology and the regulation of AI companions.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Powell Highlights Hiring Slowdown as a Key Economic Risk</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a significant slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, reinforcing expectations that the central bank may implement two more interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to economists, Powell noted that while inflation remains a concern, the "rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment." This suggests the Fed is becoming more worried about the job market than about prices, signaling a potential shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank is approaching the end of its "quantitative tightening" program, which involves shrinking its massive bond holdings. In a speech, Powell stated that the Fed may soon reach its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves in the banking system, a technical but important shift in monetary policy. He also acknowledged that a softening labor market is bringing the Fed's dual mandates of stable prices and maximum employment into better balance, opening the door for future interest rate cuts.
