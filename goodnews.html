          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has successfully conducted the first operational launch of its new Vulcan rocket, carrying two military satellites for the U.S. Space Force. The launch from Cape Canaveral marks a major milestone for ULA as the Vulcan is set to replace its legacy Atlas V and Delta rockets. One of the payloads is an experimental satellite, NTS-3, designed to test advanced navigation technology for more accurate and jam-proof GPS data. This flight certifies the Vulcan for carrying high-value national security payloads, positioning ULA to compete in the national security launch market.</p>

The plan, announced by several government financial bodies, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on loans for various purchases, including cars and education. This policy is part of a larger strategy by Beijing to unlock household spending potential and support the economy, which includes a 30-point policy package.

He reflects on the resilience he gained after his family lost their Pacific Palisades home in a devastating fire in January 2025. Antonio, who is studying business, credits his father for his intense training and for providing a strong example of fortitude after the family lost everything in the blaze. The experience, while tragic, brought his family closer and taught him that their safety was the most important thing.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. This move comes as Google faces a potential court order to divest Chrome following an antitrust ruling that found the company holds an illegal monopoly in internet search. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and argues that an independent Chrome would benefit the public. The startup, valued at $18 billion in July, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study reveals that progress has been significantly uneven across different types of cancer. Research from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine shows that cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%. However, there has been little improvement for some of the deadliest cancers, such as those affecting the pancreas, esophagus, and lungs, which remain difficult to detect and treat. Experts are calling for a new government strategy focused on cutting wait times and investing in research for these less survivable cancers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the 2.4 million learner drivers who take the test annually with life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at emergency scenes. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public access defibrillator. Officials hope this change will help prevent avoidable deaths by increasing public knowledge of first aid.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey is taking full advantage of the return of veteran Keenan Allen, from whom he is now able to learn directly. Before Allen's return, McConkey had been studying the veteran's game film to improve his own route-running skills. Now sharing the field, the two are working closely together, with McConkey constantly seeking advice from one of the league's elite receivers. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman noted that Allen's presence provides flexibility and strength to the offense, creating an exciting dynamic between the established star and the promising rookie.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, lifting a boil water notice that was in effect for a week. The issue began when a faulty, decades-old valve became stuck, disrupting water service to about 9,200 households. After complex repairs, the DWP has restored service and confirmed water quality, though it advises residents to flush all pipes and appliances before consumption. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the African nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's responsibility for events that cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France, which detailed the use of forced displacement and support for brutal militias by French colonial troops. The acknowledgment is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's complex and often violent colonial history in Africa.</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, including alleged key operatives of the powerful Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, to the United States. This marks the second major transfer of its kind this year as Mexico responds to U.S. pressure to crack down on drug trafficking organizations. The extradited individuals face charges in American courts for violent offenses and organized crime. The move demonstrates continued collaboration between the two countries on security issues, even as diplomatic tensions persist over how to best combat the flow of illegal drugs across the border.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile or sensitive cases. The change aims to combat misinformation and enhance public trust through greater transparency, particularly following cases where online speculation led to unrest, such as the 2024 Southport riots. While the decision to release such information will remain with individual forces, the move is intended to create more consistency. The guidance also clarifies that verifying a suspect's immigration status is the responsibility of the Home Office.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, believes the company has the potential to become the UK's most valuable firm by leveraging its nuclear technology to power the energy-intensive AI industry. The engineering giant is developing small modular reactors (SMRs) to provide a stable energy source for data centers, with deals already signed with the UK and Czech governments. Despite SMRs being an unproven technology on land, Erginbilgic is confident in its massive market potential. This strategic pivot into energy comes as the company's core aircraft engine business rebounds strongly. (not investment advice)</p>
