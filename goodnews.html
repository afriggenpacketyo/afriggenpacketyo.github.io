        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Driven by growing concerns about ultra-processed foods, retailers and brands are increasingly offering products with fewer ingredients. This trend is welcomed by consumers with allergies and those seeking simpler, more natural food options. However, some nutritionists caution that focusing solely on ingredient lists may overlook the importance of nutrient fortification. The article explores the debate surrounding processed foods and the challenges of balancing simplicity with nutritional value. The article is neutral in tone, reflecting the ongoing debate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have tested key components for quantum-based communication in a space flight, aiming to build an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a rocket to assess their robustness against the stresses of space travel. This test marks a step toward constructing a quantum secure direct communication network. QSDC is considered a potentially more secure alternative to quantum key distribution, skipping the key-sharing step and sending messages directly through a quantum channel. The article's tone is forward-looking, reflecting the potential of the technology.</p>
