          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced a boost as the Trump administration prepared to roll back the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. A Department of Commerce spokesperson stated the rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation, while Nvidia welcomed the administration's new direction on AI policy, stating it would create a once-in-a-generation opportunity for America to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD's CEO also supported the decision, emphasizing the need to balance national security with the industry's growth.</p>

          <p>In a House hearing focusing on colleges beyond the Ivy League, presidents from Haverford College, DePaul University, and California Polytechnic State University faced scrutiny regarding their handling of antisemitism on campus. Three college presidents apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing on Wednesday, in what Republicans billed as an effort to examine colleges beyond the Ivy League. Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democrats accused Republicans of using antisemitism as a political weapon. The hearing reflected ongoing tensions between higher education and the federal government regarding campus protests and accusations of antisemitism.</p>

He also criticized the California High-Speed Rail project, while acknowledging a good relationship with Newsom.
