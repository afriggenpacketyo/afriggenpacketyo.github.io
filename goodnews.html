          <p>Los Angeles has a new architectural landmark in the form of a five-story vertical mausoleum at the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The Gower Mausoleum was designed to address the growing demand for burial space in the dense urban environment by building upwards rather than outwards. The modern structure, which features marble, natural light, and views of the city, provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people. This development is part of the cemetery's broader effort to integrate itself into the community by hosting cultural events, making it a place for both the living and the deceased.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. The letters captured their fears about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from whether they had a girlfriend yet to their dreams of attending university. The emotional exercise, organized by their teacher, allowed the now 16-year-old students to reflect on their personal growth and the unique challenges they faced during their disrupted secondary school education as they prepared to receive their GCSE exam results.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight boxing prospect Moses Itauma delivered a statement performance by stopping veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their bout. In his first headline fight, Itauma showcased his power and precision, sending Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hook just 119 seconds into the match. The referee waved off the fight after Whyte rose to his feet but was deemed unfit to continue. The decisive victory extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13 wins and strengthens his position as a future star in the heavyweight division.</p>

          <p>Nine prison guards who were held hostage by rioting inmates in Guatemala City for three days have been freed by authorities. The riots were initiated by members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs, who were demanding the return of ten of their leaders from solitary confinement at another facility. The situation had been tense, with one prison official having been shot and killed a day earlier amid the unrest. This incident is part of a larger pattern of gang-related violence that plagues the country's prison system and society at large.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, challenging stereotypes of Chinese cuisine and using Singapore as a key test market before entering other regions. Brands like Luckin Coffee and Nong Geng Ji are introducing diverse, authentic regional dishes, moving beyond the simplified fare common in Western countries. This culinary expansion is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and reflects a broader rise in Chinese soft power. While this trend introduces more variety for global diners, it also creates significant pressure for local restaurant businesses who struggle to compete with the well-funded and strategically savvy Chinese chains.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled “Sunset Boulevard” sheds light on the final burst of creativity from Elvis Presley, collecting music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. The collection features hits like “Burning Love” and soulful ballads such as “Separate Ways,” showcasing his expressive vocal abilities in his later years. According to his longtime friend Jerry Schilling, this period also included a significant disappointment when Presley lost the co-starring role in “A Star Is Born” opposite Barbra Streisand. Schilling believes this missed opportunity marked a turning point that contributed to the decline preceding Presley's death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Samsung is regaining ground in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip series, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard smartphone design. The success of these premium devices, along with a wide range of products at various price points, has renewed the competitive dynamic between the two tech giants, pressuring Apple to innovate its own device lineup.
