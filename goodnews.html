          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones after reporting urinary symptoms. The cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, was detected after Biden saw a doctor for these symptoms. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options, with doctors noting the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. The announcement has prompted discussions about Biden's health and future endeavors, given his previous concerns about age during his presidency.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick revealed that he spent $5,000 on special milk requested by Antonio Brown for Tom Brady during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots. The milk, intended to support Brady's nutrition-oriented lifestyle and foster a good relationship with Brown, went bad due to a mix-up in the mailroom. Belichick authorized the expense to avoid ruining the relationship between the two players. While Brown's time with the Patriots was short-lived, he and Brady later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
