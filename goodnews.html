          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a highly publicized trial. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene, but convicted her of driving while intoxicated, for which she received a one-year probation order. Read thanked her supporters and maintained her fight for justice for O'Keefe, while her father acknowledged the legal team and content providers who helped spread the word about the case. The trial garnered significant public attention, leading to a TV show and a Netflix documentary.</p>

          <p>The FDA approved Gilead's lenacapavir injection (Yeztugo) for HIV prevention, offering a more convenient option than daily pills or bi-monthly injections. Clinical trials showed the injection virtually eliminated new HIV infections when administered every six months. While the annual list price is $28,218, Gilead plans to ensure accessibility through insurance coverage and assistance programs. Experts believe Yeztugo could significantly reduce new infections, particularly among marginalized communities where adherence to daily pills is challenging, however, the launch of the injectable drug faces potential threats, including the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts assess the potential environmental impact if the U.S. were to use a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. Because the plant processes uranium isotopes in gas form, experts suggest any contamination would likely remain localized due to the gas's heavy molecules. While the two main uranium isotopes present a low-level radiation hazard, the uranium hexafluoride gas could react with air to form hydrofluoric acid, posing a risk. However, the mountain's collapse from the strike would likely inhibit any environmental release.</p>
