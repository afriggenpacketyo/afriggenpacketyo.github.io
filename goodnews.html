          <h2>China Advances Commercial Nuclear Power with New Gigawatt-Level Fast Reactor Design</h2>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its next-generation nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for a commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. The reactor, named CFR-1000, is a gigawatt-level facility designed for greater fuel efficiency and is now awaiting government approval for construction. This development positions China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, who are also developing advanced reactor technologies. The project aims to become operational after 2030 and represents a key part of China's strategy to enhance its energy independence and technological capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Key performances came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak with a double and a sacrifice fly. The improved hitting provided solid support for the pitching staff, including a scoreless effort from the bullpen, as the team looks to build momentum ahead of the trade deadline.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Quant Hedge Funds Recruit Top Talent Amid US Academic and Visa Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on difficulties faced by international PhD students in the United States, such as funding cuts and stricter visa policies, to recruit top talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract scientists and engineers who might have previously stayed in the US. This brain gain is helping fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which is the world's second-largest and increasingly leverages artificial intelligence. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for elite financial and technological expertise, driven by both US policies and China's market growth.</p>

          <p>A small business owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her three-year trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the Leicester-based salon 'nkd', is fighting to re-register her business's trademark, which L'Oréal opposes. The French firm argues that the 'nkd' name is too similar to its 'Naked' line of beauty products and could cause consumer confusion. After significant delays and personal expense, a hearing date has been set with the UK's Intellectual Property Office, with Dowdeswell stating she is ready to continue the fight against what she sees as corporate overreach.</p>

          <h2>UK's Warm and Sunny Spring Leads to Boom in Some Insect Populations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a key food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. However, experts caution that the long-term trend for flying insects is one of decline. The current lack of rain could also negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland areas and affecting egg-laying, highlighting the complex effects of changing weather patterns on ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents unlawfully obstruct federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins stated that the policies do not improperly regulate federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor praised the decision, affirming their commitment to policies they argue enhance public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the legacy of the Hollywood blacklist, which arose from the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigations into alleged Communist influence in the 1940s and 50s. The exhibit focuses on the “Hollywood Ten,” a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled industry figures to name names, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The display serves as a historical lesson on the fragility of free speech and the dangers of political persecution.</p>

          <h2>Texas Wildlife Biologists Relocate Bighorn Sheep to Save Species from Disease</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease. After losing about half the population in five years, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, protected colony away from the source of the disease. Recent observations have confirmed the relocated sheep are surviving and have even produced new lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery in the region.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis examines the scientific basis for popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. While a new study suggests 7,000 steps may be sufficient for health benefits, experts offer nuanced views on other goals. A kidney specialist notes the body is well-equipped to regulate hydration through thirst, while a sleep expert emphasizes that consistently getting at least seven hours of quality sleep is vital for long-term health. The consensus suggests that while these numbers are useful guides, a balanced and consistent approach to overall wellness is more important than rigidly adhering to specific targets.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how elite competition uniquely affects the female body. Researchers are studying topics once considered taboo, such as how breast movement impacts running mechanics and the performance benefits of a proper sports bra. Other key areas include the effects of the menstrual cycle on performance and the higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, in female athletes. This shift away from treating female athletes as “mini-men” is leading to better support, improved performance, and a greater understanding of how to keep women healthy and active in sports.</p>
