          <p>A new Lending Tree study reveals that nearly six million full-time workers without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, challenging the traditional view of college as the sole path to financial success. The report highlights diverse fields, including software development, sales engineering, and elevator repair, where a significant percentage of non-degree holders achieve six-figure salaries. This trend aligns with growing skepticism among young people about the value of a college degree amid rising tuition costs and student debt. Many companies are also relaxing degree requirements, opening more opportunities for skilled workers.</p>

          <p>Google has cut more than 35% of its managers overseeing small teams in the past year as part of an ongoing effort to reduce bureaucracy and enhance efficiency. This move follows several rounds of layoffs, buyouts, and reorganizations across the company, aiming for managers to constitute a smaller percentage of the overall workforce. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated the need for Google to scale efficiently without solely relying on headcount increases. The company has also offered voluntary buyouts, which executives report have been successful, with many employees opting for career breaks.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement announcement, numerous brands quickly capitalized on the news, offering well-wishes and promotional deals across social media. Companies from food chains to airlines integrated the couple's news into their marketing strategies, often with Swift-themed captions and product placements. Experts note this trend reflects brands' efforts to connect with audiences through pop culture, though some caution against opportunistic and inauthentic engagement. While some brands like Ralph Lauren and Starbucks garnered praise for their relevant and witty responses, others risk audience fatigue by jumping on every cultural moment without genuine connection.</p>

          <p>Toni, a popular pygmy hippo from Berlin Zoo, has successfully relocated to her new home at the French town of Mulhouse. The move was described as smooth and relaxed, with hopes that Toni will breed with another hippo named Voobadee in the coming two years. Toni gained fame after a viral video of her birth, and her name was chosen by football star Antonio Rüdiger. Pygmy hippos are an endangered species native to West Africa, with fewer than 2,500 remaining in the wild, making this breeding effort crucial for conservation.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has decided to revert to its original logo, scrapping a recent redesign that sparked public outcry and a significant dip in the company's market value. The new logo, which removed the iconic 'Uncle Herschel' figure and the 'Old Country Store' phrase, was criticized for being generic and abandoning the brand's folksy image. The reversal came after widespread social media backlash and a public urging from President Donald Trump. Marketing experts noted the misstep highlighted the importance of understanding customer emotional investment in a legacy brand's story and identity.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce is described as existentially fitting for an artist whose identity is deeply intertwined with the concept of 'forever love.' From her teenage songs like 'Love Story' to more recent works, marriage and lasting commitment have been recurring motifs throughout her discography. While her lyrics have also explored the tension between ambition and relationships, Kelce appears to embrace her fame and intellect. The announcement, soundtracked by 'So High School,' suggests a return to a youthful longing for love before her astronomical fame, marking a significant personal milestone for the pop superstar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies have found that direct cash transfers to low-income individuals did not consistently produce lasting improvements in mental health or financial well-being, complicating the ongoing debate over universal basic income (UBI). While the concept has gained traction as a solution for economic justice, these findings have led to renewed scrutiny and polarized reactions. Critics on the right use the research to question welfare policies, while proponents on the left argue that cash aid primarily aims to reduce poverty and provide basic security, not to 'fix' people or solve all systemic issues. The discussion highlights the nuances of measuring the impact of such interventions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is expected to report robust fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts forecasting $1.01 adjusted earnings per share and $46.02 billion in revenue, representing a 53% year-over-year growth.

Key questions for analysts include the performance of Nvidia's Blackwell chips and the state of its China business, especially after recent export control changes and China's push for homegrown chips.

The airline also plans to remove the €80 monthly cap on staff earnings from this bonus. O'Leary defended the policy as necessary for faster boarding and fewer delays, while also dismissing sustainable aviation fuel targets as 'nonsense' due to supply issues.</p>

Known for their city of Petra and extensive trade routes, the Nabataeans built caravanserais and churches to support their voyages, transitioning to Christianity in the 4th century A.D. The discovery of intact baptismal pools, including a cross-shaped one for adults, offers a tangible link to their past.
