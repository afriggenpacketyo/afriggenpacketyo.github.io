          <p>The mayor of Nagasaki is considering Taiwan's request to attend this year's ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of the city in August. Taiwan, which has never been officially invited, has expressed its wish to join for the first time, though Nagasaki's policy remains unchanged. The city plans to send invitations to countries and regions with diplomatic missions in Japan or representative offices at the UN, which excludes Taiwan. This contrasts with Hiroshima, which indicated it would include Taiwan after Taipei expressed interest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the votes, while Trzaskowski received 49.1%, marking a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The result is likely to energize the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, potentially impacting the 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major international trial has demonstrated that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can reduce the risk of dying by a third. The three-year exercise program, which started soon after chemotherapy, aimed to get patients to double the exercise guidelines for the general population, with weekly coaching sessions. Results showed that 80% of people exercising remained cancer-free after five years, compared to 74% in the other group. The study suggests that exercise has a significant beneficial effect on cancer survival, although the exact reasons are still unknown.</p>

          <h2>Vogue Declares 'Chic' Dead; Alternatives Explored</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 06:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vogue argues that the word "chic" has lost its essence due to overuse and co-option by influencers, who mistake it for monied strains of taste rather than unique style. The article explores the possibility of rehabilitating alternatives such as "snazzy," "trendy," and "swish" to add linguistic plurality. While the author acknowledges the usefulness of "chic," they suggest it may be time to embrace more creative and interesting descriptors. Despite this, the author concedes that "chic" is likely too ingrained to disappear.</p>

          <h2>California Aims to Solve Reading Crisis with Phonics-Based Instruction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is on track to mandate phonics-based reading instruction in schools, a move supported by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has allocated $200 million for teacher training. This decision follows decades of debate on the best approach to teaching reading, with the state historically favoring a "whole language" approach. The proposed law requires districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading," which emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Early results from districts implementing this approach show significant gains in reading proficiency.</p>
