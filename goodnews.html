The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Some Republican senators have voiced concerns about Medicaid provisions, highlighting the challenges in securing enough votes for the bill's passage.

In the 2024-25 season, he made 43 appearances for Sunderland, scoring four goals and providing three assists.
