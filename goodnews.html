          <p>Sanshiro Murao clinched his first judo world championship title in the men's 90-kilogram division, defeating compatriot Goki Tajima in the final after a series of ippon wins. Shiho Tanaka also secured her maiden world title in the women's 70-kg final, overcoming top-ranked Lara Cvjetko of Croatia. Tanaka's victory was especially poignant, as she had recovered from a severe knee injury sustained in 2022 that threatened her career. These wins contribute to Japan's total of six gold medals at the ongoing world championships, marking their best performance since 2018. The article reflects the athletes' dedication and perseverance on the world stage, showcasing Japan's continued dominance in judo. </p>

          <p>A U.S. judge appointed by Biden has issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's policy of only allowing male or female gender designations on U.S. passports. The ruling extends a previous decision that blocked the policy for six individuals, now applying it to all Americans. The judge stated that the policy discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in prejudice towards transgender Americans, causing psychological distress and safety concerns for those whose passports do not align with their gender identity. Trump's executive order, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," directed agencies to recognize only two sexes.</p>
