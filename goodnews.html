          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize a deal transferring the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily suspended by a High Court injunction. Two Chagossian women filed a case against the Foreign Office, leading to the judge's order to halt any conclusive steps in the negotiations. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was scheduled to attend a virtual signing ceremony with Mauritian government representatives, but the court will now hear the case again. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using an airbase on the archipelago, despite the transfer of sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Mayuri Chari and Janhavi Khemka, two Indian women artists, are making their mark with unique artistic visions shaped by their personal experiences. Khemka, a hearing-impaired artist, explores sound through vibration and tactile mediums, drawing inspiration from her mother. Chari's work challenges societal views on the female body, often sparking controversy but resonating with Indian women. Both artists have faced challenges, including institutional rejection and societal pressures, but their art continues to garner international attention and empower others to express their own realities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing in April was higher than anticipated, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, a ¬£1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since records began in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. The ONS estimates borrowing for the financial year ending in March to be ¬£148.3 billion, slightly less than initially projected but still above the government's independent forecast.</p>

          <p>China is calling on the European Union to provide a fair and transparent business environment for Chinese companies after Brussels proposed a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc. The European Commission's proposal includes a two-euro fee for packages valued under 150 euros sent directly from overseas, mainly impacting China's e-commerce firms. A lower fee of 50 cents would apply to parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment for all parties involved.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a recent drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price rise reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt and pro-crypto initiatives from President Trump's administration have contributed to the rally. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, previously a Bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to purchase the digital currency (not investment advice).</p>
