        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court addressed the extent of presidential authority over federal agencies, ruling that while President Trump could fire members of certain federal boards, the Federal Reserve board members have greater protection against presidential removal. The court's decision clarifies the boundaries of executive power in relation to independent agencies. The justices suggested the Federal Reserve's unique structure affords its members more job security. This ruling comes after challenges to Trump's firing of Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris from other federal agencies' boards, with implications for the independence of various regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are projected to be the cheapest since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, averaging $3.08 per gallon, which is significantly lower than last year. This decline is attributed to economic uncertainty and increased oil production, with some analysts predicting prices could drop below $3 a gallon later in the summer. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses are expected to increase, potentially offsetting savings at the pump. The article also lists the states with the highest and lowest average gas prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have developed blood and urine tests capable of detecting the amount of ultraprocessed foods a person consumes. By utilizing machine learning, scientists identified metabolites correlated with processed food intake, creating a biomarker score to predict ultraprocessed food consumption. The tests could reduce errors associated with self-reported dietary questionnaires, providing objective biomarkers for future studies linking processed foods to chronic diseases. While the new method requires further validation across various age groups and diets, researchers suggest using Nutrition Facts labels to limit intake of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.</p>

          <p>David Brooks argues against the populist narrative that America experienced economic decline due to globalization and neoliberalism. He contends that government policy became more progressive and wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO. Brooks suggests that manufacturing job losses are primarily due to increased productivity and technological advancements, not solely foreign competition. He emphasizes that the forces driving populism are mainly about immigration, cultural values, and distrust in institutions, rather than purely economic factors, and concludes that the economic policies of the past 30 years have been largely successful.</p>

While the findings are not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had a notably lower risk of obesity-related cancer and all-cause mortality, prompting researchers to call for further investigation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing an amendment to a domestic policy bill that would create $1,000 "Trump accounts" for newborns, aimed at kickstarting wealth creation. These accounts, managed by banks or investment firms, would be invested in the stock market and could be used for specific expenses like education or a down payment on a home. While families could contribute up to $5,000 annually, some experts are questioning the accounts' tax benefits and whether the initial government contribution will be sufficient for long-term goals.

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to a new low in 2025, averaging 8.23%, making it an opportune time for homeowners to consider this financing option. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing protection against potential future rate hikes, and are currently more attractive than HELOCs due to increasing HELOC rates. Homeowners with pressing financing needs, such as consolidating high-interest debt, may benefit from taking advantage of the low rates now. The article does not offer investment advice.</p>

          <p>The House Republicans have advanced a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package that could significantly impact household finances. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proposes making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and includes provisions affecting student loans, health savings accounts, and car ownership. The bill also includes Medicaid and SNAP cuts to offset the costs of the tax relief, and offers a bonus tax deduction for older adults. The bill would also eliminate subsidized federal student loans and create a tax deduction for car owners who pay interest on an auto loan for vehicles assembled in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally on Thursday, hitting a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Factors contributing to the surge include easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has highlighted alternative stores of value. Unlike previous rallies, this one has been slower and more gradual, reflecting growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation and a pro-crypto agenda pushed by President Trump.
