          <p>India has won its first Test series under the new captaincy of Shubman Gill, achieving a clean sweep against the West Indies. The decisive seven-wicket victory was secured on the fifth morning in Delhi, with opener KL Rahul scoring an unbeaten half-century. This win solidifies India's third-place position in the early World Test Championship standings. The foundation for the victory was laid by first-innings centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Gill himself, overcoming a resilient second-innings fightback from the West Indies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is launching the Janus Project, a significant new program to deploy commercial nuclear microreactors for powering its bases worldwide. This initiative aims to address the logistical challenges of fuel supply, especially in remote or contested areas, and support the increasing energy demands of modern military technology. Using a contracting model inspired by NASA's commercial partnerships, the Army will collaborate with private companies to build and operate these small, factory-built reactors. The program is designed to enhance energy independence and is seen as a game-changer for military operations, particularly in strategic locations like the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced an end to the Israel-Hamas war following the release of remaining Israeli hostages and over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. While the initial steps of a 20-point peace plan have been executed, Middle East experts emphasize that the most challenging negotiations lie ahead. Key unresolved issues include the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of an international body to govern the territory. The fragility of the ceasefire was highlighted when Hamas reportedly failed to return the remains of all hostages who died in captivity.</p>

          <p>Doctors are debunking several claims about acetaminophen, widely known as Tylenol, following President Trump's recent assertions linking its use in pregnancy to a higher risk of autism. Experts have refuted the unproven theory that low autism rates in the Amish community are due to their avoidance of medications like Tylenol, noting that the Amish do use the drug and that genetic factors can influence autism prevalence. Medical professionals also countered the administration's advice against giving Tylenol to young children, stating it is safe and necessary in certain situations when used correctly. The article highlights the dangers of circulating medical misinformation.</p>

          <p>Randy Insko, who previously served as sheriff of Robertson County, Kentucky, for 21 years, has been appointed to complete the term of his successor, Terry Gray. Gray resigned from his post while in jail following his third DUI arrest in less than two years, a demand initiated by Governor Andy Beshear. At the time of his latest arrest, Gray was reportedly in uniform, armed, and driving a department vehicle at high speed with a blood alcohol content nearly three times the legal limit. The county judge-executive appointed the retired Insko to avoid giving any potential candidate an unfair advantage in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Candid New York," compiles the groundbreaking work of George Bradford Brainerd, a civil engineer and photographer from the 1870s. Brainerd is recognized as a pioneer of "instantaneous photography" for developing early handheld cameras that allowed him to capture spontaneous moments of daily life on New York City streets. His work provides a unique historical record, documenting a wide array of city dwellers, from musicians and paperboys to beggars. The book, authored by Erik Hesselberg, highlights Brainerd's significant but often overlooked contribution to the evolution of candid photography.</p>

          <h2>Global Trade Growth to Slow but Remain Resilient Despite Tariff Hikes, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 05:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from DHL and New York University suggests that global trade has proven resilient against the Trump administration's tariff increases and is not heading toward a reversal of globalization. The study forecasts that global trade volume will grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but slower than earlier predictions. While trade saw a surge in the first half of the year, likely due to businesses front-loading shipments to avoid tariffs, growth is expected to slow significantly in the coming year. The research indicates that a collapse of global trade is a risk but not the current reality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is publicly supporting the introduction of a targeted screening program for prostate cancer, arguing it could "save countless lives." A new report from Prostate Cancer Research, a charity for which Sunak is a patron, outlines a cost-effective initiative focusing on men at highest risk, such as black men and those with a family history of the disease. While proponents, including public figures like Sir Steve McQueen, emphasize the potential to reduce inequalities and catch the cancer early, some medical experts remain cautious. They cite concerns about the reliability of PSA tests and the risk of over-treatment for non-aggressive cancers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 is on track to achieve its third consecutive year of double-digit percentage gains, a feat that has only occurred 11 times in the past century. Historical data shows that following such a streak, the market's performance in the fourth year is unpredictable, with stocks falling nearly as often as they rise. In four of the past instances, the rally extended into a fourth year, most notably during World War II and the dot-com boom of the 1990s. The article concludes that while the next year is uncertain, a long-term investment perspective in the S&P 500 has historically been successful. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission involved the Starship upper stage and its Super Heavy booster, both of which completed their flight paths as planned, with the booster splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico and the upper stage in the Indian Ocean. This flight marks the final test of the current prototype before SpaceX moves to a new version with upgrades designed for future missions to the Moon and Mars. The successful test is considered another significant step for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified Starship for lunar landings.</p>

Despite struggling with his control, walking a batter to load the bases, Treinen managed to secure the final out and preserve the win. The performance marked a potential turning point for the pitcher, who has had a difficult season after being a key part of the team's World Series run last year. The save provided a much-needed contribution from the bullpen and demonstrated manager Dave Roberts' continued confidence in the veteran player.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in schools after the tragic loss of both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to help his father, who died of a cardiac arrest, if he had been taught life-saving skills at a younger age. He has already successfully persuaded his own school to introduce the training and is now taking his "Pulse of Life" campaign to the Scottish Parliament. Health organizations support the initiative, noting that Scotland's low survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests could be improved if more people were equipped to perform CPR.</p>

The AI then replicated this style to generate the missing characters, resulting in a complete 919-character scroll. This project demonstrates the potential of combining AI with cultural preservation, allowing traditional art forms to find new life and expression in the digital age.</p>
