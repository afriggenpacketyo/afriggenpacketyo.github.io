          <p>A new cooperation agreement aims to significantly boost cross-border e-commerce and economic ties between China and Kazakhstan. The pact involves Freedom Bank, virtual payment provider Verum Payments, and UnionPay Business, and will facilitate simplified payment channels in both yuan and U.S. dollars. Timur Turlov, CEO of Freedom Holding, emphasized the goal of building interoperable platforms for digital lending, tokenized assets, and AI-driven credit scoring. This development reflects the strengthening relationship between the two countries, with Kazakhstan being a primary destination for China's Belt and Road Initiative investments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan measure to repeal the legal authorizations used for the 1991 and 2003 wars in Iraq. Proponents argue that these decades-old Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to engage in military action without new congressional approval. The amendment, which was attached to the annual defense spending bill, represents a significant move by Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over declaring war. Similar efforts have previously stalled, but this vote indicates growing bipartisan consensus on the issue.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 has fallen from the list of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to early data from the CDC for 2024. The virus, which was the third leading cause of death in 2020, now ranks lower, reflecting a significant decrease in mortality and a broader 4% decline in overall U.S. deaths. Heart disease and cancer continue to be the top two causes of death. This statistical shift marks a major milestone in the nation's transition away from the most acute phase of the pandemic.</p>

The itinerary includes a formal welcome with a royal salute, a state banquet, and bilateral talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. A key moment of the visit will be when President Trump pays his respects to the late Queen Elizabeth II by laying a wreath at her tomb in St George's Chapel.

          <p>The Department of Labor's internal watchdog has launched a review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and its methods for collecting and reporting key economic data. The probe will examine how the agency compiles its monthly jobs and inflation reports, such as the Consumer Price Index. This action follows significant downward revisions to previously reported job numbers and President Trump's recent firing of the BLS commissioner, whom he accused of political bias. The investigation has sparked concern among economists about the potential for political interference to undermine trust in official government statistics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina to enforce its ban on transgender students using public school bathrooms that align with their gender identity. This decision allows a ninth-grade transgender boy to continue using the boys' restroom while his legal challenge against the state law proceeds. The court's unsigned order is not a final ruling on the case's merits but represents a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the student and transgender rights advocates. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the state's request.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service has reversed a decades-long ban and will now provide N95 respirator masks to federal firefighters. The agency had previously argued that masks posed a heat exhaustion risk, despite growing evidence of long-term health dangers from smoke inhalation, including increased cancer rates. This policy change, which follows media reports and pressure from lawmakers, aligns U.S. practice with that of other nations like Canada and Australia, which already provide such protective equipment. The move is being hailed as a crucial step toward protecting the health and safety of wildland firefighters.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock value surged by nearly 36%, marking its best single-day performance since 1992 and adding an astounding $244 billion to its market capitalization. This historic rally was triggered by the company's announcement of a massive $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, shattering analyst expectations. The unprecedented demand is being driven by Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which has become a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom. The stock's performance briefly elevated founder Larry Ellison to the status of the world's richest person, underscoring Oracle's ascendant role in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced a landmark discovery from its Perseverance rover, which has collected a rock sample on Mars containing "potential biosignatures." Scientists describe this as the closest humanity has come to finding evidence of ancient life on another planet. The sample, from the Jezero Crater, has mineral compositions and textures that, on Earth, are typically associated with microbial life. While non-biological processes cannot be entirely ruled out with current data, the finding is a major breakthrough. The next crucial step is the ambitious Mars Sample Return mission to bring the rock to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

He contends that this pricing model, where costs fluctuate based on demand, will exclude many passionate fans by making tickets unaffordable, thereby prioritizing profit over the event's atmosphere. The petition demands an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale values, and a 15% allocation of tickets for local residents to ensure community access to the global event.</p>

          <p>A widespread bus strike that was set to disrupt dozens of routes in London over the weekend has been largely called off. The Unite union announced that a majority of the workers, employed by the company London United, voted to accept an above-inflation pay offer, thus canceling their planned walkout. However, negotiations are still underway with a second operator, London Transit. If these talks fail, a much smaller-scale strike will still affect a handful of routes, but the widespread travel chaos initially feared by Londoners has been averted.</p>
