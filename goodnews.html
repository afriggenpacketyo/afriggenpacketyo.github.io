        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 has turned positive for the year after a significant rally from its April 8 closing low, driven by easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Eight stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust portfolio, including Meta Platforms, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and Nvidia, have also turned positive for the year after initially being down. The article underscores the importance of remaining invested during market downturns. It remains uncertain where the market and these individual stocks will go in the near future, but easing U.S.-China trade tensions and recent business deals are positives for market sentiment.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 13:10:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates have experienced fluctuations in 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain the federal funds rate. After declining to an 18-month low in January, HELOC rates have recently increased slightly in response to market conditions, but they are still lower than they were in September 2024. HELOCs remain a relatively affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans and credit cards, and they are well-positioned to exploit potential rate cuts later in the year. Homeowners considering HELOCs should account for potential volatility, but they could find it to be a beneficial borrowing option in the current financial climate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report highlighting high levels of arsenic in rice brands sold across the U.S., experts recommend several strategies to reduce exposure. These include diversifying your diet with rice alternatives like quinoa, barley, and couscous, which contain lower levels of heavy metals. Checking labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California has lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S., and cooking rice like pasta, using a high water-to-rice ratio and draining the excess water, can also help reduce arsenic content.</p>
