          <p>Rice prices in Japan have surged, more than doubling in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar rises in previous months. This spike has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles in an attempt to moderate prices. Concurrently, Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations and remaining above the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) 2% target for the 38th consecutive month. While a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman anticipates a waning of food price pressures in the coming months, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could impact energy prices.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling supports a lawsuit brought by 20 states arguing that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. This decision prevents the administration from withholding critical funds used for maintaining roads, airports, and other infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Three major players in the autonomous vehicle industry, Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla, are preparing for expanded robotaxi services. Waymo is already offering paid rides in several cities and recently expanded its service areas in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Zoox opened a new production facility with the capacity to produce 10,000 robotaxis per year, while Tesla is testing driverless vehicles in Austin. The success and safety of these companies' testing will be critical for the continued expansion of robotaxis and the acceptance of autonomous vehicles.</p>
