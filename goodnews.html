          <h2>Expansion of Free School Meals Planned for England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 14:29:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils by September 2026, benefiting children whose parents receive Universal Credit, regardless of their income. This measure aims to save parents ¬£500 annually and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While Labour supports the expansion, they also face calls to address child poverty by scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics claim the policy could reduce school funding, but the government has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change, with details to be outlined in the upcoming spending review. The move has been welcomed by celebrities and organizations focused on child poverty. The optimism score of this article is relatively high, as it reflects a positive step towards addressing child poverty and improving educational outcomes for vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has announced the return of its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a previous decision to discontinue it. The company acknowledged the cancellation of the Hemi engine as a mistake, attributing the move to tightening fuel economy regulations and a push toward electric vehicles. This decision reflects automakers' adjustments to plans as EV adoption has been slower than anticipated, and as the Trump administration has sought to unwind initiatives pushing for electric vehicles. The Hemi is expected to account for a significant portion of Ram 1500 sales.
