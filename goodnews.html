          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While some coastal areas in Russia and Japan experienced flooding, initial waves were smaller than feared in many locations, leading authorities to downgrade warnings to advisories. Officials still urged caution as the event unfolded, with transportation disruptions and evacuations occurring in numerous countries. The powerful quake is among the strongest ever recorded, prompting a significant but ultimately manageable international response.</p>

          <p>Cincinnati Bengals star defensive end Trey Hendrickson is set to end his training camp holdout and rejoin the team, according to reports. The move comes despite not yet securing the new long-term contract extension he has been seeking. Hendrickson, who led the NFL in sacks last season, was the final player in the league holding out over a contract dispute. His return is a positive step for the Bengals as they prepare for the upcoming season, though negotiations are expected to continue.</p>

          <p>Industry leaders suggest that the regulatory environment in Washington D.C. has become more favorable toward cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under the Trump administration. Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie noted a shift from an "antagonistic" to a more welcoming and innovative-friendly attitude from regulators. This change follows President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, aligning with his goal of making the U.S. a "crypto capital." The perceived friendlier climate is encouraging for firms looking to launch new crypto-related financial products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting, but the decision is surrounded by significant intrigue. Two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have advocated for a rate cut, creating the potential for rare public dissent on the committee. The meeting also occurs against a backdrop of intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who has demanded policy easing. Despite these factors, the committee is likely to maintain its current stance, delaying any potential cuts until at least September while navigating economic data and political scrutiny.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that Ukrainian refugees who fled to the United States following Russia's invasion will likely be allowed to stay until the conflict ends. This statement comes after months of uncertainty regarding the "Uniting for Ukraine" parole program, which the administration had previously considered terminating. Approximately 240,000 Ukrainians have sought refuge in the U.S. since 2022.

          <p>Germany's government has approved a draft budget for 2026 that includes significant spending of €520.5 billion, supported by new borrowing of about €174 billion.

The goal is to revive economic growth after a period of stagnation.

This strategy is notable as they utilize some of the league's youngest and lowest-paid defenders to execute it against high-priced attackers.

The state used a small, dedicated office and is now piloting AI to scan and compare regulations for inconsistencies and excessive stringency.

While online dating was the primary way 39 percent of straight couples met in 2017, only 20 percent met through friends, a stark reversal from previous decades. Experts suggest this shift is due to the vast choice and control offered by apps, which contrasts with the limited and sometimes awkward nature of a setup.
