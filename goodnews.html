          <p>Taiga Nishino, a 15-year-old Japanese figure skater, is generating buzz after successfully landing two quadruple jumps. Despite being too young for the next Winter Olympics, Nishino has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. He landed a quad toe loop at a competition in Yokohama and previously executed a quad salchow at the junior high school nationals. Nishino, who started skating at 5, aims for success at the world junior championships and Junior Grand Prix Final, showing significant growth and potential in the sport.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed military academies to base future admissions solely on merit, ensuring the most qualified candidates are admitted. In a memo to West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy, Hegseth stated that prioritizing merit ensures lethality and warfighting readiness. Military departments have 30 days to certify that race, ethnicity, or sex will not be considered in applications, with merit potentially weighted by athletic talent, prior military service, or performance at a preparatory school. Hegseth emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards for a strong officer corps.</p>

          <p>While giving a live interview, Washington D.C.'s interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin was spat on by a woman who called him "disgusting." The incident, captured on video, occurred while Martin discussed the withdrawal of his nomination to be the permanent U.S. attorney, a position that was instead filled by Jeanine Pirro. Martin's nomination failed after Senator Thom Tillis withdrew his support. He will now serve as an associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney. The woman's motive remains unclear, but the incident reflects heightened political tensions.</p>

          <p>The Soviet spacecraft Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space and is expected to return within the next few days. While the exact landing location is unknown, experts believe it will likely splash down in the ocean. Although the spacecraft was designed with a heat shield, it is expected to break apart upon impact, and any surviving pieces legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams's previously dropped federal corruption case. While the official purpose was to discuss city priorities, Trump suggested Adams was there to thank him. The released documents indicate an F.B.I. investigation into witness tampering, though Adams was not charged. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case led to resignations within the department, and Adams is now running for re-election as an independent.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that the U.S. may reduce tariffs on China, writing on Truth Social that "80% Tariff on China seems right!" ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The conciliatory tone follows Trump's earlier announcement of tariffs up to 145% on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliation from China. Wall Street analysts believe that the market is eager for a resolution to the trade war, and that a reduction below 80% would likely result in a positive reaction. Trump also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, raising hopes for further agreements.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British artists have signed a letter urging Prime Minister Starmer to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill to protect creators from AI. They seek transparency from AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material in training AI models, arguing that failing to do so would essentially give away their work to tech firms. The amendment, proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, aims to allow for licensing agreements between creators and AI companies. The government says it is consulting on measures to balance the interests of creative industries and AI companies.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels along the West Coast from Oregon to the Mexican border, effective through October 31. Naturally occurring toxins, which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning, make the mussels potentially poisonous to humans. Biotoxins accumulate in the mussels' tissue as they consume toxic algae, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to frequent testing.</p>

Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked, allegedly due to her political speech. Judge Sessions criticized the government's lack of evidence against her, aside from an op-ed she co-wrote. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was targeted for criticizing the university's response to resolutions regarding Israel. She testified about her humanitarian work and involvement in school groups, and the judge cited declarations attesting to her peaceful character.</p>
