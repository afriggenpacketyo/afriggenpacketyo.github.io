          <p>The European Union and Southeast Asian nations are seeking collaborative strategies to protect undersea cables, essential for telecommunications and international trade, from sabotage and accidental damage.

          <p>Tottenham is reportedly close to appointing Brentford's Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham, though confirmation of dialogue between the clubs is pending.

Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, with sources suggesting it would cost Tottenham over ¬£10m to release him from his contract, which runs until 2027.</p>
