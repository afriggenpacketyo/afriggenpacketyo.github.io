          <p>OpenAI has entered a significant, multi-year agreement to purchase gigawatts of AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a move seen as a major challenge to Nvidia's dominance in the sector. The deal, which AMD expects to generate tens of billions in revenue, caused AMD's stock to surge while Nvidia's saw a slight dip. OpenAI, which also has a major investment deal with Nvidia, stated the need for immense computing power to meet demand for its AI products like ChatGPT. This diversification of chip suppliers highlights the escalating demand and competition within the AI hardware industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Bisignano will hold both roles simultaneously, overseeing daily operations at the IRS while continuing to lead the SSA. The Treasury Department cited the shared technological and customer service goals of both agencies as a key reason for the dual appointment. This move follows recent leadership instability at the IRS, with its previous commissioner stepping down after only two months on the job.</p>

          <p>South Africa's women's cricket team staged a remarkable comeback at the World Cup, defeating New Zealand by six wickets after a devastating opening loss to England. The victory was anchored by a brilliant century from batter Tazmin Brits, who scored 101 runs, her fifth one-day international hundred this year. After dismissing New Zealand for 231, the Proteas comfortably chased the target in just over 40 overs. The win revitalizes South Africa's campaign, while New Zealand's lackluster performance puts them under pressure in the group stage of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed processing student debt forgiveness for some borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, according to a trade group. The program, which cancels remaining debt after 20-25 years of payments, had been partially paused since July while the Education Department assessed court actions related to other repayment plans. The resumption of discharges comes amid a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the administration of unlawfully depriving borrowers of their rights. However, advocates note that significant backlogs remain for other forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.</p>

The acquisition is aimed at strengthening Firefly's national security offerings by integrating SciTec's software capabilities, including missile warning and tracking systems. The news caused Firefly's stock to climb 7%, recovering from a recent drop after a rocket explosion during a ground test.

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has selected former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. A hardline conservative and supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vision, Takaichi faces immediate challenges, including addressing inflation and managing diplomatic relations. Her staunchly conservative positions, including visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, are already straining her party's long-standing coalition with the centrist Komeito party. Takaichi has vowed to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance as a cornerstone of her foreign policy.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the routine protests and serious threats she has faced since joining the court, stating that she is not afraid and refuses to live in fear. She explained that she has learned to be "businesslike" about protests and does not let them affect her emotionally or guide her decisions. Barrett, promoting her new book, also discussed her judicial philosophy of originalism, emphasizing that she views cases based on the law and the Constitution, not personal feelings or loyalty to a specific president. She asserted this disciplined, analytical approach is crucial for maintaining the Court's long-term perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent drop in interest rates, the monthly payments on a $550,000 mortgage are now considerably lower than they were at the beginning of the year. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.34%, which would result in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $3,419, over $200 less than at the start of 2025. Similarly, 15-year mortgage rates have also decreased, offering savings for those seeking to pay off their loans faster. For existing homeowners, refinancing at these lower rates could also lead to substantial savings, though closing costs must be considered.</p>
