          <p>European stock markets closed higher on Monday, with major indices in the U.K., France, and Germany all posting gains. Investor focus was on a critical confidence vote in France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was expected to be ousted over proposed budget cuts. Despite the political instability, markets were buoyed by positive corporate news, including a significant investment by ASML into French AI startup Mistral AI. The positive sentiment was also influenced by hopes for a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut following weaker-than-expected American hiring data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed an $83.3 million judgment against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court rejected Trump's claims of presidential immunity and arguments that the damages awarded were excessive. The ruling stated that Trump acted with reckless disregard for the truth when he denied Carroll's sexual abuse allegations and continued his attacks throughout the litigation. The decision upholds both the $18.3 million in compensatory damages and the $65 million in punitive damages, concluding they were fair and reasonable given the harm and death threats Carroll received.</p>

          <p>Nearly six years after a controversy involving the NBA and China over a pro-Hong Kong tweet, LeBron James has authored an essay in the state-run People's Daily. The essay, published during his "Forever King Tour" in China, expressed gratitude for the warm reception from Chinese fans and a desire to contribute to the country's basketball development. This move is notable given James's past criticism of former Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey for being "misinformed" on the Hong Kong issue. The publication suggests a significant thawing of tensions between the NBA and the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>The BBC has announced that food critic Grace Dent and chef Anna Haugh will take over as the new hosts of the popular cooking competition "MasterChef." They replace Gregg Wallace and John Torode, who were dismissed after a 20-year tenure following a report that upheld claims made against them. Dent has been a frequent guest on the show, while Haugh has served as a judge on the professional spin-off series. The change marks a significant new era for the long-running program, with Matt Tebbutt also set to join "MasterChef: The Professionals."</p>

Following surgery that removed most of his tongue and reconstructed it with tissue from his thigh, he had to relearn how to speak and sing. A year after his treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Blevins has clear screenings and has returned to performing, with his first ticketed show in August. Inspired by their experience, Blevins and his wife have launched "The Tough Crowd Project," a nonprofit to support other families facing cancer.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many Americans are exploring debt relief strategies to manage their financial burdens. This article explains various options available, such as debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, and credit counseling for creating manageable payment plans. More aggressive methods include debt settlement, where a reduced amount is negotiated with creditors, and bankruptcy, which legally eliminates or restructures debts under court supervision. The article advises that while these tools can provide crucial assistance, they come with significant trade-offs, including potential impacts on credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. job market shows signs of slowing, experts are offering guidance for the more than 40 million Americans with student loans who may be facing unemployment. For federal loan borrowers, options include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly payments to as little as $0 based on current income. Other relief measures like the Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment can pause payments temporarily, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Borrowers with private loans are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to inquire about available hardship programs. (not investment advice)</p>
