          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of first-choice votes. Cuomo, a former governor, acknowledged Mamdani's strong campaign, which resonated with younger voters. Despite the concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate reaching the 50% threshold, with comprehensive results expected on July 1. Cuomo's campaign indicated he might consider an independent run in the general election, potentially complicating matters for the Democratic Party in the heavily Democratic city.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut her stint short due to her political views, race, and lobbying from pro-Israel groups after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. The ABC apologized to Lattouf, stating they had "let down our staff and audiences" in their handling of the matter, and she was awarded damages.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East, suggested that an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes was leaked, calling the move "treasonous." The assessment, reportedly by U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back by a few months. Witkoff also assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program quickly. He emphasized that no one is shooting at each other and the conflict is over.</p>

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal reflects the political challenge of overhauling environmental regulations to speed up housing construction, despite resistance to changing the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The budget relies on borrowing money, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding to offset a $12 billion deficit. Key elements include changes to Medi-Cal funding, such as requiring undocumented immigrant adults to pay monthly premiums, and a housing caveat that lessens environmental review requirements for building projects.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction to the states that sued against Trump‚Äôs Department of Transportation. The ruling stated that the states' lawsuit would likely succeed, finding that the Trump administration had violated the law when it withheld the funding. The February order from the Trump administration had directed states not to spend $5 billion allocated under the Biden administration as part of the national electric vehicle infrastructure program.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, offering insights into how new stars are born. Using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin much faster than older ones. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study presents evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
