          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. According to a spokesperson, the company is not modifying any GPU designs for China to comply with these restrictions. A source familiar with the matter clarified that Nvidia is leasing new space in Shanghai for existing employees, continuing its longstanding presence in the region without transferring intellectual property or GPU designs. This statement follows reports that CEO Jensen Huang discussed establishing a new R&D center in Shanghai to assess compliance with U.S. regulations while catering to the local market, with actual production and design remaining outside China.</p>

          <p>Staff employees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts are moving to unionize, citing months of layoffs and job uncertainty following changes initiated by the Trump administration. More than 150 employees across various departments, including education, donor relations, and arts programming, are concerned about the institution's mission and legacy. Staff members report a lack of transparency and communication from leadership, with ticket sales reportedly down 50%. The unionization effort aims to restore job security and improve communication, with employees planning to vote with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump has gone missing from her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, leaving only the feet and the tree stump it stood on. This is not the first time a tribute to the former First Lady has met an unfortunate end in Sevnica, as a previous wooden statue was burned down. Local police are treating the disappearance as theft and have launched an investigation. The statue, commissioned by US artist Brad Downey, was intended to be durable and resistant to destruction, but it was ultimately removed from its base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years, according to a memo from Chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will involve consolidating functions, modernizing business practices, and offering voluntary deferred resignation programs to eligible employees. This initiative aims to ensure the Fed is right-sized and able to meet its statutory mission. The central bank had nearly 24,000 employees in 2023, and a 10% reduction would bring the number below 22,000. This decision comes amid calls for cost cuts across civil service agencies, though Powell's memo did not explicitly mention these external pressures.</p>

The debt relief follows the U.S. lifting sanctions on Syria and a meeting between President Trump and Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. The Syrian government has also signed an $800 million memorandum of understanding with DP World to develop the Mediterranean port of Tartus.</p>

          <h2>HELOC Interest Rates Fluctuate in 2025 Amid Economic Changes</h2>

          <p>HELOC interest rates have experienced fluctuations in recent months, responding to market conditions and Federal Reserve policies. While rates initially declined to an 18-month low in January, they have recently increased slightly. Despite these fluctuations, HELOCs remain a relatively affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans and credit cards. The variable nature of HELOC rates positions borrowers to potentially benefit from predicted rate cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Republican Tax Plan May Benefit Wealthy More Than Workers, Analysis Shows</h2>

          <p>A Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, and some taxpayers may actually be left in worse financial shape if the bill becomes law. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026. The analysis factors in proposed federal spending cuts. The top 0.1 percent, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026.</p>
