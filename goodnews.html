          <p>The U.S. stock market enjoyed a strong week, marked by the S&P 500's impressive nine-day winning streak, fueled by positive labor data and quarterly earnings from tech giants like Apple and Amazon. Despite some investor concerns over Apple's services revenue and Amazon's forward guidance, Microsoft and Meta Platforms emerged as top performers, driven by robust earnings reports. Eli Lilly faced a decline due to a competitor's partnership, while the market overall digested the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Investors are now looking ahead to upcoming earnings reports from companies like Ford and Disney, as well as insights from the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix's stock has surged to all-time highs, marking an 11-day winning streak fueled by strong first-quarter revenue growth driven by subscriptions and advertising dollars.

While traditional media stocks have struggled, Netflix has thrived, forecasting full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion. Despite subscription price hikes, Netflix appears to have maintained its value proposition, although the company has stopped sharing details on membership numbers.</p>

          <p>Allergy sufferers are experiencing worsened symptoms this year due to warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns, which cause plants to release pollen earlier and for longer periods. May is typically the peak pollen season, with high levels of both tree and grass pollens. Climate change is contributing to this increase, with warmer temperatures causing plants to bloom earlier and produce more pollen. Experts recommend limiting exposure by keeping windows closed, showering at night, and using over-the-counter medications, while also suggesting consulting a physician for prescription options or immunotherapy if symptoms persist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With many borrowers facing financial strain, debt forgiveness is gaining attention as a potential relief strategy, offering the possibility of paying less than the total balance owed. However, it's essential to consider key questions before pursuing this option, including whether you meet the requirements, have explored other debt relief options, and need expert help with negotiations. Debt forgiveness typically requires being significantly behind on payments and demonstrating financial hardship, and it works best with unsecured debts. Other options like debt management plans or debt consolidation may be more suitable depending on individual circumstances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April, adding 177,000 jobs with an unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2 percent, despite the onset of a global trade war. While these figures are based on surveys taken just after the Trump administration's tariff implementations, the full impact on the labor market is expected to unfold in the coming months. Analysts are closely watching consumer sentiment and business plans, as tariffs could lead to higher prices and potential economic strain for households. The Federal Reserve faces a challenge in balancing employment and inflation if the trade war leads to slower growth and rising prices.</p>

          <p>With the average homeowner possessing a substantial amount of home equity, understanding the most cost-effective ways to access it is crucial. Currently, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) offers the lowest interest rates compared to home equity loans and cash-out refinancing. While HELOCs have variable interest rates, they are expected to remain affordable, especially with potential interest rate cuts later in the year. Reverse mortgages offer an alternative with no monthly repayments, but are typically reserved for homeowners aged 62 and older. Borrowers should carefully consider repayment scenarios to ensure long-term affordability.</p>
