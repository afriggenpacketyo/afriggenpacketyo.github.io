          <p>Liverpool has reportedly accepted a deal worth approximately £65.5 million from Bayern Munich for Colombian forward Luis Diaz. The 28-year-old was left out of a recent pre-season match amid the transfer speculation and has been permitted to travel for a medical examination. This move follows Liverpool's recent acquisitions of forwards Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, as they reshape their attacking lineup. Diaz joined Liverpool in 2022 and had his most prolific scoring season in 2024-25, netting 17 goals across all competitions.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a successful weekend as two of its major films, "Superman" and "F1," each crossed the $500 million threshold in worldwide ticket sales. The success of "Superman" is a significant early victory for the new leadership at DC Studios, marking their first major theatrical release under a new 10-year plan. For Apple, which Warner Bros. distributed "F1" for, this achievement establishes a new record for its highest-grossing theatrical release, underscoring the benefits of its strategic partnership with IMAX for the film's production and exhibition.</p>

          <p>Investors are preparing for a significant week featuring a Federal Reserve policy meeting, crucial inflation and jobs data, and earnings reports from major companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.

Additionally, the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index and the July nonfarm payrolls report will provide further insight into inflation trends and the health of the labor market amid ongoing trade negotiations.

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" achieved a successful opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million in domestic ticket sales and $218 million globally. This strong performance, alongside the recent success of "Superman," suggests that well-made superhero films can still attract large audiences, countering narratives of "superhero fatigue." The film's positive reception, with an 88% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, marks a potential turning point for Marvel, which has seen inconsistent box office results and critical reviews for some of its recent post-"Endgame" releases.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured his sixth victory of the season at a rain-affected Belgian Grand Prix, extending his lead in the championship.

          <p>The United States and China are reportedly set to extend their current tariff truce by another three months during trade negotiations in Stockholm. The original 90-day suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, was due to expire on August 12. According to sources, the extension will involve a commitment from both nations to refrain from imposing new tariffs or otherwise escalating the trade conflict. While the talks are not expected to yield major breakthroughs on specific issues like industrial overcapacity, they aim to maintain a de-escalated environment for continued dialogue.</p>

          <p>Beijing and Washington are expected to extend their tariff truce by another three months at trade talks in Stockholm beginning on Monday. China and the United States agreed in May to remove most of the heavy tariffs levied on each other’s goods for 90 days while continuing trade negotiations. That suspension is set to expire on August 12. During the third round of trade negotiations between the world’s two biggest economies, both will expound their views on major sticking points – such as the US’ concerns over China’s industrial overcapacity – rather than achieve specific breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from imposing new funding restrictions on organizations that serve vulnerable populations. The lawsuit, brought by a nationwide coalition including six Rhode Island groups, challenges requirements that force grant recipients to align with the administration's views on gender identity and diversity. The groups argued the conditions would force them to abandon inclusive practices or censor support for transgender people. The ruling is a critical, temporary victory for providers serving domestic abuse survivors, LGBTQI+ youth, and unhoused communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new savings vehicle, dubbed the "Trump IRA," has been established to encourage saving for children under 18, allowing for up to $5,000 in annual contributions. The plan includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born within a specific timeframe, with funds growing and being withdrawable tax-free after age 18. However, some financial analysts argue that while the initial bonus is appealing, other established methods like 529 education plans and Roth IRAs offer more significant long-term benefits. Whole life insurance policies are also presented as a powerful alternative for locking in low premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant boosts in employee happiness, and the reason extends beyond just having more free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that the compressed schedule forces employees and teams to become more effective and productive. By eliminating busywork and streamlining processes, workers feel more in control and successful in their roles, which enhances their overall well-being. This sense of increased professional competence and team spirit is a powerful, and previously unexpected, driver of the positive outcomes observed in the studies.</p>
