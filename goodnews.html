          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reversed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players posthumously, making them eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Rose, banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, can be considered as early as 2028. Hall of Fame Chairman Jane Forbes Clark stated that anyone removed from the permanently ineligible list will be considered. Rose holds the record for hits (4,256), games (3,562), at-bats (14,053), plate appearances (15,890) and singles (3,215).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ross Douthat's New York Times article delves into the concept of successful right-wing art, questioning whether it's a category error or a meaningful description. He references Jonathan Keeperman's views on art that tells the whole truth and Christopher Scalia's book on novels conservatives will love. Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture aspects of reality in a non-propagandistic way. He uses examples like V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" to illustrate how ideological art can succeed through unsettlement and unexpected sympathy, rather than conversion.</p>

Schiff, along with other Senate Democrats, raises constitutional, legal, and national security concerns related to the possible gift from Qatar. The senators requested a "comprehensive audit and investigation" into any "fraud, waste, and abuse" when a potential transfer is completed, given that a mandatory retrofit of the plane would need to occur if it were to be used as Air Force One.</p>

Google's Gemini AI product has 35 million daily active users, compared to ChatGPT's estimated 160 million daily active users.

          <p>Former leftist president of Uruguay, Jose "Pepe" Mujica, died at the age of 89. Mujica garnered popularity as the "world's poorest president" during his term from 2010 to 2015. An ex-guerrilla fighter, he gave away much of his salary while in office to charity. Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024, when the affliction was diagnosed. Mujica oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world's most socially liberal democracies, legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacting the region's first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy.</p>
