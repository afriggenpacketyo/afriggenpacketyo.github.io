          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, unexpectedly discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy while excavating trenches. The remains, believed to belong to a woman from the pre-Inca Chancay culture, were found remarkably well-preserved with intact dark brown hair. Archaeologists note that such discoveries are common in Lima, a city with hundreds of archaeological sites, due to the region's dry desert climate which aids in natural mummification. This finding adds another piece to the rich tapestry of ancient civilizations that inhabited the area long before the Spanish colonization.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit low-key, return to boxing by defeating Tyrrell Herndon with a seventh-round stoppage. This marks Wilder's first victory since October 2022, following a series of difficult losses that had cast doubt on his career. The fight was a more measured performance from the typically explosive puncher, who stated he is working to become a more complete fighter. After the win, the 39-year-old expressed that he is on a new beginning, focused on repairing himself emotionally and rekindling his passion for the sport.</p>

          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, a chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment systems like WeChat and Alipay provide the nation with a significant edge in the global stablecoin race. He argues that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operate under a mature regulatory framework. This perspective suggests China can leverage its existing digital payment infrastructure and regulatory experience to stay competitive as stablecoins become more prominent in the global economy.
