          <p>Vietnam is undertaking a major overhaul of its tax system, aiming to abolish the simplified lump-sum method used by millions of small businesses by 2026. This reform is part of a broader strategy to empower the domestic private sector, increase tax revenue for infrastructure projects, and crack down on corruption within tax offices. All businesses will be required to adopt a more formal declaration-based system, a move that has caused distress among some small business owners facing higher costs and complexity. The government's goal is to create a fairer competitive environment and modernize its economy, though the transition presents significant challenges for entrepreneurs.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has agreed to a deal to acquire 19-year-old winger Ben Doak from Liverpool for an initial fee of £20 million, which could rise to £25 million with add-ons. Doak, a Scottish international, is expected to finalize the transfer within the next 24 hours, seeking more consistent first-team opportunities after limited appearances for Liverpool. The sale is part of a busy summer for Liverpool, which has generated significant revenue from player transfers. Bournemouth has also been active in the market, aiming to strengthen its squad under manager Andoni Iraola before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>China is closely observing the diplomatic outcomes of the recent meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, viewing it as an opportunity to understand Trump's high-stakes negotiation style. Following the talks, Trump urged Ukraine to accept a peace deal involving territorial concessions, a shift that analysts believe signals to Beijing that many issues are negotiable under his administration. While this may align with China's preference for transactional diplomacy, Trump's unpredictability also introduces a level of caution for Beijing. The summit's developments are being evaluated for potential implications on U.S.-China relations, including disputes over trade and Taiwan.</p>

          <p>China's market for public cloud services supporting artificial intelligence experienced a massive 55% growth in 2024, reaching a value of $2.7 billion. According to consultancy IDC, this surge was driven by the widespread adoption of large language models and the evolution towards more autonomous, agentic AI systems. Tech giants Baidu and Alibaba Group Holding emerged as the market leaders, each capturing approximately 25% of the market share, followed by Tencent and Huawei. The report highlights a significant shift from traditional AI applications like computer vision to a focus on generative AI, which now dominates market demand.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is spearheading a significant push for global expansion, with overseas investments surpassing domestic spending for the first time in 2024. This strategic shift is driven by intense competition and significant overcapacity within the domestic market, where EV assembly plants operated at less than 50% capacity last year. According to a report by Rhodium Group, this move reflects a broader government ambition to establish a strong offshore economic presence. Chinese EV firms are now navigating the higher costs and risks of international markets to secure future growth and escape the saturated conditions at home.</p>

          <p>In response to mounting political pressure to reduce medication costs, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash. This price is less than half of the drug's monthly list price of nearly $1,350 and follows a similar discount program for its weight-loss drug, Wegovy. The move aims to improve access for uninsured or underinsured patients and to compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions of the medication. The decision comes after President Donald Trump urged pharmaceutical companies to lower prices and adopt direct-to-consumer sales models.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear energy startup Kairos Power have announced a partnership to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. Under the agreement, TVA will purchase up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power from the Hermes 2 reactor to help supply Google's regional data centers. This collaboration marks a significant step for the advanced nuclear industry, as it utilizes a power purchase agreement model where Google and Kairos assume the financial risks of construction, shielding consumers from potential cost overruns. The project aims to demonstrate the viability of smaller, more affordable nuclear technology for meeting rising energy demands from AI.</p>

          <p>As Hurricane Erin churns in the Atlantic, understanding the system used to classify such storms is crucial for public awareness and safety. Hurricanes are rated on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which consists of five categories based on sustained wind speeds, providing an estimate of potential property damage. A Category 1 storm features winds of 74-95 mph, while a Category 5, the most severe, has winds of 157 mph or higher, capable of causing catastrophic destruction. Storms rated as Category 3 or higher are designated "major hurricanes" due to their potential for significant loss of life and damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has announced significant tax reforms that spurred a rally in the nation's stock markets. The plan involves streamlining the goods and services tax (GST) into a two-rate structure of 5% and 18%, which is expected to simplify compliance and lower the tax burden on businesses and consumers. This fiscal stimulus is designed to bolster India's domestic consumption-driven economy, which could help offset the negative impact of U.S. tariffs imposed over India's trade with Russia. Sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and automotive are anticipated to be major beneficiaries of the new tax policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has launched a new recruitment strategy aimed at Generation Z by partnering with social media influencers from the worlds of fitness, cooking, and extreme sports. These influencers create sponsored content showcasing immersive Army experiences, such as basic training exercises and skydiving, to present military life to audiences who might not otherwise be exposed to it. The campaign aims to boost enlistment numbers, which have faced shortfalls in recent years, by highlighting themes of readiness, discipline, and stability. However, the initiative has drawn some criticism online, with some commenters labeling the posts as propaganda amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts.</p>

          <p>An initiative by the Trump administration to remove "negative" historical information from U.S. national parks has been met with widespread public opposition. Following a Department of the Interior order, signs with QR codes were installed at park sites, asking visitors to report materials that "inappropriately disparage Americans." However, an analysis of nearly 500 submitted comments shows that most visitors have rejected the idea of sanitizing history, instead calling for more comprehensive information on topics like slavery and the mistreatment of Indigenous peoples. The effort is seen by critics and some park staff as a politically motivated attempt to create a whitewashed version of American history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are increasingly embracing spicy foods, a trend driven by young people, globalization, and innovations in the food industry. According to consultancy Datassential, over half of U.S. consumers are now likely to purchase a spicy item, a significant increase from 2015. This shift is attributed to greater exposure to global cuisines, the food industry's use of spice as a cost-effective flavor enhancer, and a cultural fascination with heat, as seen in viral food challenges. As consumers' tolerance for spice grows, food companies are introducing even hotter products, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of increasing spiciness in the American diet.</p>

Despite the severity of the injury, which doctors described as unprecedented in medical literature for a survivor, the patient's spinal cord remained intact.

          <p>Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken an unconventional six-city tour to promote his 2024 film "Megalopolis," which was a critical and commercial disappointment upon its release. The events, billed as "An Evening with Francis Ford Coppola," feature the director engaging in long, unmoderated discussions on the film's philosophical themes in an effort to cultivate a cult following. This director-led revival attempt is unusual, as cult classic status is typically built organically by audiences over time. While the tour has drawn crowds, it highlights the challenge of manufacturing a grassroots phenomenon and reflects an auteur's deep personal investment in his work's legacy.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after losing his reelection campaign, former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has announced he will run for the Senate again in 2026 to represent Ohio. Brown, who was the last Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio, lost his seat to Republican Bernie Moreno in the 2024 election. His 2026 bid will be for the seat previously held by Vice President JD Vance, setting up a likely contest against Republican appointee Senator Jon Husted. The race is expected to be a key battleground as Democrats aim to regain control of the Senate in a state that has trended increasingly Republican.</p>
