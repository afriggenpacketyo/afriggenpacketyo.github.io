          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for potentially record-breaking temperatures, with forecasts predicting highs of up to 33C. This could mark the hottest day of the year for two consecutive days. The Met Office anticipates that many regions will meet heatwave criteria, defined as sustained high temperatures for three straight days. Health alerts have been issued across England due to the potential impacts on public health and social care services, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. Firefighters are also urging caution as wildfires have surged, increasing by 717% compared to last year. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered a speech at a Juneteenth Celebration Service in Galveston, Texas, criticizing what he described as ongoing attempts to erase history. Speaking at the Reedy Chapel AME Church, Biden highlighted the importance of remembering the events of Juneteenth and its significance to America's story. He referenced efforts to remove aspects of history from textbooks and classrooms, seeming to allude to his successor, President Trump, without naming him directly. Biden also pointed to his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting it with the Trump administration's push to restore the old names.</p>

The uncompleted tunnel, equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation, and a track system, was discovered by the Border Patrol‚Äôs San Diego Sector. The tunnel ran underneath the Otay Mesa border point and was believed to have exited at a commercial warehouse. Authorities seized a package containing methamphetamine inside the tunnel, and contractors are expected to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that irreparable harm would occur without it. The ruling came in response to the Department of Transportation imposing conditions on grant funding, requiring adherence to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. Judge McConnell agreed with the states, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures implemented last month. The decision comes as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. This follows a rate cut last month, the first since October, aimed at cushioning the impact of trade tensions with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is increasing its influence in Central Asia, as evidenced by a recent high-level summit with its Central Asian partners. This has sparked questions about the potential waning of Russia's regional dominance, particularly as it remains focused on the conflict in Ukraine. Despite these concerns, the Kremlin has dismissed the possibility of diminished influence, emphasizing its strategic partnership with China and its historical ties with Central Asian countries. Diplomatic observers note that Moscow's capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence is limited, though Beijing is avoiding challenging Russia's role as the region's key security guarantor.</p>
