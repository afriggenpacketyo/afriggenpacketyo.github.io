        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, homeowners are evaluating borrowing options against their home equity. A $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) currently presents slightly lower monthly payments than a traditional home equity loan due to its variable interest rate. However, this also introduces unpredictability, as rates could rise in the future, whereas a fixed-rate home equity loan offers stable, predictable payments despite being marginally more expensive upfront. The article advises homeowners to weigh the benefits of potential future rate cuts against the security of a fixed payment schedule. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins at Bethpage Black, the European team is bracing for a notoriously boisterous New York audience, with the first tee expected to be a cauldron of noise. Players like Tommy Fleetwood are embracing the unique pressure, while the team has engaged in a charm offensive during practice rounds, signing autographs and interacting with fans. This strategy aims to potentially soften the crowd's intensity, though players and captains acknowledge the atmosphere will become fiercely partisan once matches start. The dynamic is a key feature of the event, with American players hoping the home crowd provides a significant advantage.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, nations are submitting updated 2035 emissions reduction targets, though many major emitters are lagging. China, the world's largest emitter, has pledged a 7-10% reduction from its peak, a target viewed by environmentalists as underwhelming but still significant. The European Union has signaled its commitment but has not yet finalized its target, while the UK has set an ambitious goal of an 81% reduction. The article highlights the global pressure on countries to strengthen their climate commitments to keep the 1.5-degree Celsius warming limit within reach.</p>

The system, rolling out in October, will replace traditional passport stamps and create a digital record of entries and exits for all non-EU visitors. The European Union states that these changes are designed to enhance security and more effectively track individuals who overstay their permitted 90-day visit.

          <p>Former Manchester United and England soccer captain Wayne Rooney has spoken candidly about his past struggles with alcohol, stating he believes he could have died without the support of his wife, Coleen. In a podcast interview, the 39-year-old revealed he was "struggling massively" with drinking during his playing career, often engaging in two-day drinking binges between matches. Rooney credited his wife with helping him manage his behavior and keeping him on the right path for over two decades. He explained that he felt unable to turn to anyone else and that her intervention was crucial in helping him gain control.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged concerns about a potential bubble while defending the company's massive infrastructure expansion, which includes a planned $850 billion buildout of AI data centers with partners like Oracle and Nvidia. Speaking from a new facility site in Texas, Altman stated the unprecedented spending is a direct response to the explosive, tenfold growth in demand for AI services like ChatGPT. He argued that this level of investment is necessary to build the supercomputing network required to advance AI capabilities. Altman conceded that in such revolutionary tech cycles, some investors will get burned by both over-investing and under-investing. (not investment advice)</p>

The pullback in the tech sector weighed on broader market performance. In company news, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has surpassed 3 billion monthly active users, a major milestone that places it in the same league as the company's other core platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. This user growth is attributed to the success of Reels and the use of AI in content recommendation systems.

During a recent meeting, she urged Beijing to engage in a "spirit of mutual understanding" to address the EU's concerns over trade practices, including export controls and market access. This marks a shift from her previously more assertive language regarding China's restrictive economic policies.

The promotion extends lower interest rates, typically reserved for buyers with high credit scores, to those with a FICO score below 620. While such programs can make vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory, they also carry a higher risk of default, especially in an uncertain economy.

          <p>The New York City Police Department is using drones to detect and prevent "subway surfing," the dangerous practice of riding on top of moving trains, which has led to 16 deaths in the past three years. Drones patrol train routes, and if someone is spotted on a train's roof, a field team is dispatched to intercept the train at the next station and remove the individual. The program has reportedly saved over 200 people, many of whom are teenagers. The initiative was highlighted by the story of Zackery Nazario, a 15-year-old who died while subway surfing, whose mother is now suing social media companies for allegedly popularizing the trend.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity rule for "pattern day traders," a change that would make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The current rule, established in 2001, requires traders who execute four or more day trades in five days to maintain a $25,000 balance. The new proposal, which awaits SEC approval, would replace this fixed threshold with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken during the day. This overhaul reflects the significant technological advancements in retail trading since the original rule was implemented. (not investment advice)</p>

This is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year, which were above 7%.

The drug, typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects, is being studied for its potential to treat a subset of children with autism who may have a blockage in folate transport to the brain. While early studies show promising effects on speech, researchers stress that more large-scale clinical trials are needed before it can be considered an FDA-approved treatment for autism. The drug's low cost presents a challenge, as there is little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund the expensive approval process.</p>
