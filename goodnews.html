          <p>China's central bank has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged after cutting them last month in response to trade tensions with the United States. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. Last month's cut was the first since October, and a number of commercial banks also reduced their deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. The loan prime rate influences corporate and household loans, while the five-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

One player described the experience as "a bit weird," implying the team was obligated to attend, while another had previously criticized Trump's policies. The event included awkward moments, such as Trump questioning whether a woman could join the team.</p>

The judge sided with 20 plaintiff states, issuing a preliminary injunction that barred the government from enforcing the new immigration rules. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. The administration's policy was deemed arbitrary and lacking specificity in how states should cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for transportation dollars.</p>
