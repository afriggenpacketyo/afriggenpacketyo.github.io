          <p>President Trump indicated the U.S. aims to strike trade deals with Japan and South Korea soon, with letters outlining deal terms to be sent to various countries within weeks. Simultaneously, the Defense Department is expected to reject most of the 20,000 troops requested by DHS for migrant arrests, raising concerns about federal law violations. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth defended the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amidst objections from Democrats about their domestic deployment. A $9.4 billion spending cut package, backed by DOGE, faces a House vote, potentially impacting funding for PBS and NPR. Optimism regarding these complex political and economic issues remains cautiously moderate.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from fossils housed in a Mongolian museum, which is believed to be the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. The 86-million-year-old skeletons reveal an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants of the dinosaur world. This discovery helps to revise the tyrannosaur family tree and provides insights into the evolution of key features, such as skull anatomy for a strong jaw. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how tyrannosaurs became powerful predators in North America and Asia.</p>
