          <p>Ken Dryden, the Hall of Fame goaltender who led the Montreal Canadiens to six Stanley Cup titles in the 1970s, has passed away at the age of 78 after battling cancer. Dryden's career spanned eight seasons, during which he won the Calder Trophy, five Vezina Trophies, and the Conn Smythe Trophy, becoming a six-time All-Star. Known for his relaxed posture on the ice, Dryden retired early at 31 but left an indelible mark on the sport. After retiring, Dryden became a broadcaster, author, and later entered politics, serving as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister. His legacy extends beyond hockey, encompassing his contributions as a public servant and author.</p>

          <p>A geopolitical contest is unfolding in central-southern Africa as China, the US, and Japan compete for control of key logistical routes to secure critical minerals for the green energy transition. The Nacala Corridor network, connecting landlocked Zambia and Malawi to the Port of Nacala in Mozambique, is a focal point of this competition. This race is not only about transporting minerals but also about establishing long-term influence over critical mineral supply chains and reducing dependence on rivals. Securing these corridors is a strategic effort by global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the reaction in Chicago to the possibility of President Trump deploying the National Guard to combat crime. While Trump cites Labor Day crime statistics as justification, local activists argue that community-led initiatives are already reducing violence. Violent crime in Chicago has decreased significantly in the past two years, but overall levels remain higher than in many other US cities. Community leaders express concern that deploying the National Guard is not the answer, advocating instead for continued funding for crime prevention programs and addressing the root causes of violence.</p>

          <p>A consumer advocacy group's report revealed that several popular sunscreens in Australia are not providing the SPF protection they claim, sparking a national scandal. The report triggered a probe by the Therapeutic Goods Association, product recalls, and raised questions about global sunscreen regulation. Customers express shaken faith in the industry, while brands defend their products and testing methods. The scandal highlights the challenges in effectively rating sunscreens and the need for consistent enforcement of regulations, as well as a reminder that regulations are only as good as they are enforced.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans and Haitians, allowing over one million people to remain and work in the United States. The judge criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for revoking protections, arguing it would force individuals to return to dangerous conditions. The ruling halts the administration's efforts to end TPS and Humanitarian Parole designations for approximately 1.5 million people. The DHS spokesperson said that the program has been "abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program" and that "unelected activist judges" cannot stop the American people's desire for a secure country.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector is experiencing a talent war, with tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Google competing for AI researchers by offering multi-million dollar compensation packages. Building AI models is capital-intensive, costing billions of dollars, which justifies the high salaries for specialized machine learning engineers. This competition creates challenges for startups and traditional industries that cannot compete with the high salaries offered by tech giants. The AI talent war is likely to continue as long as the cost of building AI models remains high, driving up the demand and salaries for AI specialists.</p>
