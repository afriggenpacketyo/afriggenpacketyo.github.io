          <h2>Trump Administration Echoes Biden's Stance on Abortion Pill Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 17:43:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising move, the Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the position previously taken by the Biden administration. The Justice Department's court filing argues that the case, brought by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. The lawsuit challenges regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to mifepristone, including its use in telemedicine and for individuals under 18. The case's initial iteration was previously rejected by the Supreme Court due to lack of standing.</p>

          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health has updated its prospectus, revealing a 50% increase in first-quarter revenue to $123.8 million, up from $82.71 million in the same period last year. The company filed to go public in March but has not yet disclosed a price range, signaling its intent to proceed with the IPO despite economic uncertainty and market volatility largely due to President Trump's tariff policies. Hinge Health's gross margin rose to 81% from 71% year-over-year, leading to an operating income of $13.1 million compared to a loss of $31.4 million in the previous year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to manufacture drugs in the United States by streamlining the approval process for new production sites. The order will enable the FDA to conduct more inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities with the same resources and increase surprise inspections of foreign drug facilities. This initiative precedes Trump's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which have already spurred domestic manufacturing investments from companies like Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, and AbbVie. However, some pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, have expressed concerns that the tariff threat could deter further U.S. investments in research and development.</p>

          <p>A controversy in Malaysia involving the publication of the country's flag without its yellow crescent in a Chinese-language newspaper during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit highlights how AI can inflame social divisions. The incident sparked outrage among the Malay-Muslim majority and non-Muslims, who perceived it as a sign of disloyalty by the Chinese vernacular outlet. The newspaper apologized and suspended its editors, but the incident underscores how AI-driven errors or manipulations can exacerbate existing tensions in polarized societies, particularly when symbols of national identity are involved.</p>
