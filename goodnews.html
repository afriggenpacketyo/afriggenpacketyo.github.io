          <p>Northampton director of rugby Phil Dowson criticized Bordeaux-Begles players for their behavior following Saints' Champions Cup final defeat, alleging foul play involving Henry Pollock. Dowson stated that Pollock was grabbed around the neck, leading to a reaction that officials will address. Bordeaux prop Jefferson Poirot confronted Pollock after an argument with fly-half Mathieu Jalibert, who accused the Northampton team of disrespecting their club's history by labeling them mercenaries. Jalibert acknowledged that while their comments might be part of match preparation, they should also show respect to other clubs, highlighting a post-match clash of cultures and expectations.</p>

          <p>The government is considering new regulations that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to complete projects within agreed timeframes. These rules aim to accelerate the construction of 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Developers would be required to commit to delivery schedules before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly miss targets could face penalties and be denied future permissions, with penalties potentially reaching thousands of pounds per unbuilt home.</p>

The wreck was located in 1972, but a detailed survey was not possible until now. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed in the same area in 1950.</p>

          <p>During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military sought ways to improve helicopter survivability, leading Sikorsky to develop a dual-hardness steel armor that could serve as the helicopter's primary structure. This armor was intended to protect against ballistic threats, and Sikorsky explored two armored helicopter options: the Aerial Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (AARV) and the Aerial Armored Personnel Carrier (AAPC). While neither project progressed to production, the Advancing Blade Concept (ABC) used in their design later influenced the development of high-speed rotorcraft like the X2 demonstrator and the S-97 Raider.</p>

          <p>Jordan Woolery hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the seventh inning to give UCLA an improbable 5-4 victory over South Carolina, forcing a decisive Game 3 in the Columbia Super Regional. Down 4-1, UCLA rallied with a pinch-hit walk, a triple, and a single before Woolery's game-winning shot. Pitcher Taylor Tinsley threw a complete game, keeping the Bruins within striking distance despite South Carolina's early lead. The Bruins overcame a base running blunder by South Carolina to set the stage for Woolery's heroics, exemplifying what coach Inouye-Perez calls 'Bruin magic'.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes for "It Was Just an Accident," spoke out against the Iranian regime's restrictions. Panahi, who has faced imprisonment and filmmaking bans, urged Iranians to unite and demand freedom, stating that no one should dictate their choices. The film, shot in secret and based on Panahi's prison experiences, tells the story of Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them.

          <p>Jafar Panahi's Palme d'Or win at Cannes is celebrated as a victory for the world's most courageous filmmaker, according to The Guardian. Panahi, who has faced arrest and imprisonment for his art and democracy activism, has created a rich body of work that reveals Iranian society with subtlety and depth. "It Was Just an Accident," his winning film, is described as his most emotionally explicit work, revealing how political oppression and resistance are embedded in Iranian life. The victory is seen as well-deserved for a director who has taken real risks for cinema and spoken truth to power.</p>

          <p>President Trump used his West Point commencement address to congratulate cadets and take credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He emphasized a shift in foreign policy away from nation-building and touted the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies. Trump claimed his administration achieved a new peacetime recruiting record, though military records show enlistments began rebounding before his return to office. The address followed Vice President Vance's emphasis on ending forever wars at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>
