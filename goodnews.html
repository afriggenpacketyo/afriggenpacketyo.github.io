        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new court filing, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has asserted that she never committed mortgage fraud and that the allegations are a pretext for her removal by President Trump. The filing argues that any inconsistencies in her mortgage applications were known to the White House and Senate during her confirmation process in 2022. Lowell contends that the true motive behind the firing attempt is to pressure the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates, thereby threatening the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock jump 8% after a federal judge ruled against the most severe penalties proposed by the Department of Justice in its landmark antitrust case. The court decided that Google will not be required to sell its Chrome browser, a crucial asset for its advertising business. While the company was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, investors reacted positively to the avoidance of a forced divestiture, viewing the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant.

Pegula secured her spot with an impressive 6-3 6-3 victory over Barbora Krejcikova, continuing her strong performance in the tournament without dropping a single set.

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that will ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. Citing concerns from parents and health experts about the negative health effects on children, including headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues, the ban aims to formalize what is currently a voluntary practice by most supermarkets. The new regulation will apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, and online stores, to protect youth health.</p>
