          <p>Actor Celia Rose Gooding shared her experience playing the iconic role of a young Nyota Uhura in the prequel series "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds." Coming from a family of 'Trekkies,' Gooding has been warmly received by the devoted fanbase for her portrayal of the Starfleet cadet. She explained that to maintain authenticity, she intentionally avoids learning about Uhura's future storylines, as her character would be unaware of what lies ahead. The current season explores Uhura's development as she navigates her responsibilities as an officer and experiences personal moments, including a budding romance, adding new dimensions to the well-known character.</p>

          <p>South African authorities have arrested six individuals, including well-known rhino breeder John Hume, in connection with a major international rhino horn trafficking ring. The arrests followed a seven-year investigation by the elite Hawks police unit into a scheme that allegedly smuggled 964 horns, valued at over $14 million, to markets in Southeast Asia. Hume, the former owner of the world's largest rhino conservation farm, and the other suspects face charges of fraud, theft, and violating biodiversity laws. While domestic trade of rhino horns is legal in South Africa, international export is banned, making this a significant disruption of organized crime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a Texas law that would have required all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, set to take effect September 1, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses by unconstitutionally coercing students into religious observance. The lawsuit was brought by a diverse group of families and civil liberties organizations, including the ACLU, who argued the mandate infringes on parents' rights to guide their children's religious education. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has announced the state will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 30 major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has urged the UK government to develop a national strategy for stablecoins to avoid falling behind the United States. In an open letter to the Finance Minister, the group argued that the UK should view stablecoins as a financial infrastructure to be embraced responsibly, rather than a risk to be contained. They expressed concern that the current regulatory approach is hindering the growth of pound-pegged stablecoins, which have a market capitalization of less than £500,000 compared to the overall $280 billion market. A national strategy could bolster the UK's position as a global financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lowe's reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by increased demand for home projects. Concurrently, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion, a strategic move to strengthen its business with home professionals. CEO Marvin Ellison noted that while sales improved through the quarter, the market for larger projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates. The acquisition, along with a revised full-year sales forecast of $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion, positions Lowe's to better serve lucrative professional contractors and capitalize on future housing market growth.

          <p>Germany and Japan are enhancing their defense and security ties in response to China's growing military influence in the Indo-Pacific region. During a visit to a Japanese naval base, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized that borders should not be shifted by force, a clear message regarding Taiwan. This deepening partnership includes joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and potential collaboration in the defense industry. Both nations, which are heavily reliant on trade, view stability in the Taiwan Strait as crucial and are working to diversify supply chains to reduce economic dependence on China, particularly for critical raw materials like rare earths.</p>

          <p>The business of IT asset disposition (ITAD), which involves securely erasing data from discarded electronic devices, is rapidly growing due to increasing cybersecurity and privacy concerns. With global e-waste projected to reach 82 million metric tons by 2030, the data left on old smartphones, computers, and servers presents a significant risk for identity theft and corporate espionage. ITAD providers use methods like physical destruction, specialized software wiping, and degaussing to ensure data is permanently removed before devices are resold, refurbished, or recycled. This service is becoming crucial for corporations, governments, and consumers to prevent data breaches from improperly handled end-of-life equipment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are reducing traditional search traffic to publishers, they are creating a new, more valuable form of engagement. The author posits that high-value conversations within AI assistants like Google's Gemini, focused on topics such as travel or financial planning, can be monetized at a much higher rate than simple search clicks. This shift could transform Google's business from a per-click model to a per-conversation one. Publishers can also leverage this trend by hosting their own trusted LLM conversations, moving from a pageview-driven model to one based on building valuable user relationships.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has turned down an improved bid of £40 million from Newcastle United for their striker, Yoane Wissa. The offer reportedly consisted of a £35 million initial payment with an additional £5 million in add-ons, which Brentford deemed below their valuation of the player. The 28-year-old DR Congo international, who scored 19 league goals last season, has expressed a desire to move to Newcastle. The rejection comes after Wissa held direct talks with Brentford's owner, signaling a potentially contentious transfer saga as the clubs remain apart on the final transfer fee.</p>

          <p>Researchers have created a nutritional supplement for honeybees that could help protect them from threats like climate change and habitat loss. In trials, bee colonies that consumed this 'superfood' produced up to 15 times more offspring that survived to adulthood. The breakthrough, led by scientists at the University of Oxford, involved engineering a yeast to produce six essential lipids, called sterols, that bees need for development but are often lacking in conventional supplementary feed. This development could provide a complete nutritional source for bees when natural pollen is scarce, helping to bolster declining populations vital for global crop pollination.</p>

However, students may face increased competition for spots in sixth form colleges due to a larger population of 16-year-olds and the growing popularity of these institutions. This cohort of students began their secondary education under pandemic restrictions, and their results will mark a significant milestone as grading standards have now fully returned to pre-COVID benchmarks.</p>
