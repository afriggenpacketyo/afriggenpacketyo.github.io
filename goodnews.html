          <p>England fast bowler Mark Wood has stated he is "quietly confident" about being fit for the first Ashes Test against Australia, scheduled for November 21 in Perth. Wood has been sidelined by a knee injury since February and underwent surgery in March, causing him to miss the entire summer cricket season. He described his rehabilitation as having ups and downs but noted positive progress during a recent training camp, where his bowling pace has been increasing. Wood is hopeful that strong performances in practice games will secure his spot for the crucial series opener.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to lift an order preventing the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The three-judge panel found that the deployment was a likely violation of the Tenth Amendment and that the administration failed to provide sufficient evidence of a "rebellion" that would justify such federal action. The court stated that political opposition and protests against federal immigration policies do not constitute a rebellion. This decision maintains the temporary restraining order, keeping federalized Guard troops from being deployed within the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Greene King, Nick Mackenzie, has identified cafes and food delivery apps as emerging rivals for the traditional pub industry. He noted that as a growing portion of the population, especially younger people, consumes less alcohol, businesses like coffee shops are capturing consumers' leisure time. In response, the pub chain is adapting by improving its coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, food-led environments. Mackenzie emphasized that while pubs must evolve to cater to changing trends, their unique role as community hubs remains a key strength.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is pursuing opportunities to export its fresh durians directly to China, aiming to significantly increase profits by cutting out intermediaries in countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these neighboring nations assist Indonesian growers with the necessary cold-chain storage and phytosanitary approvals required by Chinese customs. An Indonesian deputy agriculture minister stated the goal is to raise profits from an average of 10% to 30%. Analysts believe that by improving its own certification and logistics processes, Indonesia can independently access the massive Chinese market.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a new record high for the third day in a row, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. The market's positive performance bucked a broader downward trend across other Asia-Pacific markets, which were weakened by concerns over the U.S. banking sector and trade tensions. While Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225 saw significant losses, the Kospi's resilience highlights investor confidence in the potential outcomes of the trade talks. The index touched an intraday high before closing with a marginal gain. (not investment advice)</p>

Known for his composure, strength, and clinical finishing, Camarda has been a prodigy since his youth academy days. Despite the immense expectations, he remains focused on his development, with both his club and the national team carefully managing his promising career.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, allowing them to prove their status easily via a smartphone app. While physical cards will still be issued, the new digital version is designed to simplify access to dedicated services like healthcare, housing support, and retail discounts. Ministers suggest this initiative will also serve as a case study for a planned, more comprehensive digital ID system for all UK residents. The digital veteran card will be the first document stored in the government's "One Login" app.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts is demonstrating his elite defensive skills at shortstop, a position he only recently transitioned to, solidifying his status as a Gold Glove finalist. His spectacular play in the ninth inning of a 3-1 playoff win over the Milwaukee Brewers was a key moment, helping put the Dodgers one victory away from the World Series. Originally a six-time Gold Glove-winning outfielder, Betts has made the difficult move to the infield look seamless, impressing his manager and teammates with his relentless work ethic. His offensive performance has also been strong throughout the postseason.</p>
