          <h2>India's Inflation Rate Continues Downward Trend in April</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 06:44:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's inflation rate slowed to 3.16% in April, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, according to recent data. This figure is lower than both the previous month's reading of 3.34% and economists' expectations of 3.27%. The dip was largely influenced by a decrease in food inflation, which fell to 1.78% from 2.69% in March. Despite this positive trend, analysts anticipate a potential rise in core inflation due to increasing gold prices, driven by ongoing trade tensions impacting global markets.</p>

          <p>The United States has returned 25 smuggled artifacts to Egypt, including sarcophagus lids, a Greco-Roman portrait, and fragments believed to be from Queen Hatshepsut's temple. The antiquities, seized in separate investigations starting in 2022, were recovered through a collaborative effort involving Egypt's consulate in New York, the New York District Attorney's Office, and U.S. security agencies. The collection also features jewelry, a granite foot fragment, ivory figurines, and a rare gold coin from the reign of Ptolemy I. Egyptian authorities estimate they have successfully repatriated nearly 30,000 artifacts in the last decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant investments aimed at revitalizing American manufacturing, the sector is struggling to fill nearly half a million open jobs. Factors contributing to this shortage include a tight labor market, the need for specialized skills, and an aging workforce anticipating a wave of retirements. While some positions require college degrees, many in-demand roles, such as maintenance technicians and machine operators, do not. Experts suggest that higher wages, improved public perception of manufacturing jobs, and increased investment in apprenticeship programs could help address the workforce gap.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered sweeping cuts to prescription drug prices in the U.S., aiming to align them with prices in other developed countries. The plan directs the Health Secretary to negotiate price reductions and enforce a "most favored nation" pricing model, potentially cutting prices by 59% to 90%. This initiative targets Medicare, Medicaid, and treatments covered by private health insurance, including slimming drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. However, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to strongly resist the changes, citing potential impacts on investment in new treatments and innovation.</p>

          <p>California is considering amending its 'housing first' policy to allow state funding for sober living homes, amid growing evidence that many homeless individuals prefer a sober environment. Assemblyman Matt Haney is pushing legislation to authorize local jurisdictions to channel up to a fourth of their state homelessness funds to residential programs that practice sobriety. This move comes as some proponents of 'housing first' recognize the need to support those seeking sobriety, and reconcile the two philosophical positions. The bill requires a harm reduction option to be available to anyone offered recovery housing, and relapse cannot be a cause for eviction.</p>

          <p>Bob Worsley, a conservative Republican, is advocating for a more generous immigration policy, arguing that America needs a secure workforce as much as it needs a secure border. Worsley believes that now that the border has been practically sealed shut, it's time to address the need for more legal avenues for workers to come to the U.S. He suggests creating bigger portals and legal openings to meet the demands of industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality. Worsley emphasizes the importance of understanding and empathizing with immigrants, having worked in various capacities in South America.</p>

          <p>Seven Democratic candidates vying for California governor in 2026 sought support from labor leaders, pledging to support pro-union agreements on housing and infrastructure projects, regulate artificial intelligence, and fund university research. However, the candidates faced scrutiny on issues such as providing unemployment benefits to striking workers and targeting the state's oil and gas industry. Lorena Gonzalez, president of the California Labor Federation, praised the candidates' strong support for unionized workers and expressed hope for more receptive stance than Newsom on key union concerns.</p>
