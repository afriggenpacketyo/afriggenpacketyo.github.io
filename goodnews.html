          <p>A security guard swiftly intercepted an anti-Israel protester who breached a barricade during a stage of the Tour de France. The individual ran onto the course near the finish line, reportedly shouting objections to the participation of an Israeli team, before being tackled and removed from the path of the cyclists. The incident followed calls from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for demonstrations against the Israel Premier-Tech team at major cycling events. Video of the forceful intervention spread quickly online, highlighting the security's decisive action to prevent disruption to the race.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly" as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed deal reportedly includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts, including a recent visit to Washington by the director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. A Hamas spokesperson indicated the group favors an interim truce but could revert to demanding a full package deal.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, found solace during the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel in a mountain meadow, an image conjured while listening to a music box from his sister. After struggling with PTSD for years, Harrison decided to make his vision a reality to help his own healing process. He bought a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spent 26 years carving new animals for it, eventually opening the nonprofit Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado. The carousel has since brought joy to over a million visitors and provided Harrison with profound purpose and healing.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan bill establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions, allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Hailed by the administration as a revolution in financial technology, the act is intended to bring digital currency into the mainstream financial system and strengthen the dollar's role. The signing ceremony was attended by top crypto executives who see the legislation as a major validation for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenized assets. Shin Hyun-Song warned that the rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges to existing infrastructures for payments, clearing, and settlement. He noted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of these digital tokens could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and conduct customer due diligence. The call for new regulations comes as the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies fuels market growth and attracts increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged over 10% in extended trading after it was announced the company will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Stocks often experience a rally upon being added to a major index, as this forces index-tracking funds to purchase the company's shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing influence of technology companies within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild leg swelling, medical experts have clarified the condition. CVI occurs when veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool, and affects about one in three U.S. adults, particularly those over 70. White House physician Dr. Sean P. Barbabella described the president's condition as "benign and common" and confirmed no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, with doctors emphasizing that the condition is manageable.</p>

          <p>The CEO of California Forever, a project backed by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced plans for a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub within the development.

The project, which has acquired over 65,000 acres of farmland, has faced skepticism from local residents who question the need for an entire new city to accommodate such industries.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will no longer use engineers based in China to provide technical support for its U.S. Department of Defense cloud clients. The policy change is a direct response to a ProPublica report that raised national security and cybersecurity concerns about the practice. The report detailed how Microsoft's Azure cloud services for the Pentagon were being supported by Chinese engineers, supervised by U.S.-based "digital escorts." Microsoft stated the move ensures that no China-based teams will assist with DoD cloud services, aiming to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in its government work.</p>

          <p>A vaccination program in Northern Ireland for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) will be expanded to include premature babies. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to infants born too early to have benefited from the RSV vaccine given to their mothers during pregnancy. RSV is a highly infectious virus that is a leading cause of hospitalization in infants, and the new injection offers approximately 80% protection. Health officials stated the program will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and better protect vulnerable children from serious illness.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable story from 2005, a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl who was kidnapped and beaten by men attempting to force her into marriage was reportedly saved by a pride of lions. According to police, the girl had been missing for a week when three lions chased off her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found. A wildlife expert at the time suggested the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for a lion cub's mewing, which could explain the pride's protective behavior. Authorities and locals considered the event a miracle, as lions in the region would normally be expected to attack humans.</p>

A senior U.S. official confirmed that with this release, no U.S. nationals are currently being held by the Maduro government in Venezuela, and expressed deep gratitude to President Bukele for facilitating the deal.</p>
