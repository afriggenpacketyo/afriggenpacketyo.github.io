          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union are meeting in London to announce a freshly struck deal aimed at strengthening trade and defense relationships, marking a major reset of post-Brexit relations. The summit addresses how Europe and Britain are reorienting themselves in a world where America is a less reliable ally on defense and trade. A new defense and security partnership is expected, outlining future military cooperation, along with an agreement on fishing access and collaboration on geopolitical issues. The deal includes extending access to U.K. fishing waters for European boats until June 30, 2038 and a youth mobility program, facilitating work, study, and travel for young people between the U.K. and EU.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has rescinded a $37.7 million fine against Grand Canyon University for alleged deceptive practices, a decision welcomed by university president Brian Mueller. The fine, initially imposed in October 2023, was based on claims that doctoral students incurred additional costs due to extra courses. Mueller had accused the federal government of targeting Christian universities, noting a similar fine threatened against Liberty University. The department's move ends a years-long legal battle for Grand Canyon University, which maintains its commitment to transparency and best practices in higher education.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the shift in attitude towards cryptocurrency under President Trump's administration, which is now embracing and promoting crypto after years of it being seen as a fringe investment. Financial regulators and the SEC are easing regulations, leading to companies like Coinbase joining the S&P 500. While advocates welcome the developments as the U.S. taking a global leadership role in finance, critics warn of potential risks to average Americans and the possibility of a financial crisis. Trump himself and his family stand to benefit financially from this crypto boom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing popularity of miniatures, fueled by social media and the pandemic, where artists create intricate, scaled-down scenes. Miniaturists attribute the trend to a desire for control, the visual appeal of detailed scenes, and the craving for deep attention in a distraction-filled world. The art form involves crafting tiny objects and environments, often telling a story through the details, and requires a range of skills from woodworking to found object art. The miniatures community is welcoming, with online support and in-person events, encouraging creativity and artistic expression regardless of perfection.</p>

          <h2>The Challenges of Switching to Natural Food Dyes: A Pickled Pepper Maker's Perspective</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's push for all-natural food dyes faces challenges, as highlighted by a pickled pepper maker's experience switching from synthetic dyes. While he found a solution for his yellow banana peppers using turmeric, other companies reliant on multiple petroleum-based dyes may face greater difficulties. Extracting natural colors is complex and costly, with some colors like blue being particularly hard to reproduce. Consumer preferences for vivid colors and established habits also pose obstacles to adopting natural dyes in the food industry.</p>

          <h2>Vegan Diet Matches Meat for Muscle Gains in Strength Training, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research indicates that a vegan diet can be just as effective as a meat-based diet for muscle growth during strength training, overturning previous assumptions about the superiority of animal protein. Studies show that as long as enough plant-based protein is consumed, the differences in protein synthesis between animal and plant sources are negligible. Mindful plant-based eating, with a variety of protein-rich foods, can deliver the necessary amino acids for muscle development. The key factor remains consistent resistance training, which is crucial for building muscle regardless of the protein source.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest Beijing may refrain from aggressive fiscal stimulus due to China's economic resilience against US tariff pressures, evidenced by April's macroeconomic data. Investment banks have revised growth outlooks following a tariff truce with the US and supportive central bank policies. While industrial output growth slowed slightly from the first quarter, it still surpassed forecasts, and retail sales increased. Additionally, China's exports exceeded expectations despite US tariffs, indicating a degree of economic stability despite external pressures.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict a typical household bill will fall by ¬£129 annually, a nearly 7% reduction. This decrease would bring the typical annual dual-fuel bill for direct debit customers to ¬£1,720, down from the current ¬£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, meaning that total bills depend on individual consumption.</p>
