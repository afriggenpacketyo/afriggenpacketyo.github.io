          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia, have been successfully rehabilitated at the New York Aquarium after being seized by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials. The coral, protected under the Endangered Species Act, was in poor health after spending five days in transit and was likely destined for pet shops. Aquarium staff have nursed the animals back to health, describing the facility as a "coral hospital." Many of the recovered corals are now on public display to educate visitors about marine conservation and the illegal wildlife trade.</p>

          <p>American pharmaceutical company Pfizer has announced its acquisition of Metsera, a developer of next-generation weight-loss drugs, in a deal valued at up to $7.3 billion. Analysts believe this major investment will encourage Chinese pharmaceutical firms already in the obesity drug space to increase their research and development spending on innovative treatments. The deal signals continued high-level interest from global pharma giants in acquiring differentiated innovation for metabolic diseases. Metsera's drug candidates aim to provide better efficacy and tolerability with fewer injections than current market offerings.</p>

The eight-member group, who writes and produces their own music, explains they manage the high output by dividing tasks and working on demos whenever they have free time. In an interview, the members expressed humility about their global success, with leader Bang Chan stating they are "still very hungry to achieve more milestones." They attribute their drive to the strong connection they feel with their fanbase, known as STAY, which motivates their continuous creative efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official, Yang Weimin, has urged the government to prioritize increasing household income in its upcoming five-year plan. He argues that weak consumer demand, a key challenge for China's economy, is fundamentally an issue of insufficient income. As Beijing prepares for its next major policy meeting, Yang's comments highlight a push to shift the country's growth model towards greater reliance on domestic consumption. This would involve raising the share of disposable household income in the national total, empowering consumers to drive economic expansion from within.</p>

          <p>In comments to reporters, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that an Israeli annexation of the West Bank "is not going to happen" and that "it's time to stop." The statement comes as right-wing members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have been pushing for annexation, particularly in response to several European nations recognizing Palestinian statehood. Trump's remarks were made following a phone call with Netanyahu about the Gaza conflict and a meeting with leaders from several Arab and Muslim nations who warned against the destabilizing effects of such a move.</p>

          <p>After facing intense takeover speculation earlier this year, British energy company BP has seen its fortunes improve, with its share price climbing over 32% since April. This positive shift is attributed to a strategic reset, strong quarterly results that beat expectations, and recent successful oil discoveries. Consequently, rumors of a potential acquisition by rivals like Shell or Exxon Mobil have subsided. The company's CEO has emphasized a focus on internal growth to drive shareholder value, moving the firm out of the takeover spotlight. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation allows affected homeowners to pause their mortgage payments for up to one year without penalties or negative credit reporting, by attesting that the fires caused them financial hardship. The law aims to ease the financial burden on families who are simultaneously paying for temporary housing while trying to rebuild their damaged or destroyed homes. This measure offers more extensive support than a previous voluntary 90-day forbearance program.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that officially approves a deal to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and review the app's code for security. The order declares the deal a "qualified divestiture" under a law passed by Congress, pushing back the enforcement deadline to allow the new structure to be finalized.
