          <p>President Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would serve as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter and former Westchester County district attorney, has been a vocal defender of the president and received a pardon for her ex-husband during Trump's previous term. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and history as a top district attorney. Martin's nomination faced strong opposition due to his support for individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot, leading to the withdrawal of his nomination.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to appoint Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., following the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination. Pirro, a former Republican district attorney, has been a long-time supporter of the president and offers him a reliable connection to a crucial prosecutor's office within the Justice Department. Her appointment resolves a challenging situation for Trump, who faced pressure from Senate Republicans regarding Martin's nomination. Pirro's background in law enforcement and unwavering support for Trump make her a suitable choice for the role, which has a term limit expiring May 20th.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden stated that he takes some responsibility for President Trump's victory in the 2024 election, while defending his own record and the timing of his departure from the campaign.

He also defended his accomplishments in office and criticized Trump's policies. Biden denied allegations that his cognitive abilities had declined and dismissed Trump's claims about the validity of pardons he issued.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when drawing congressional lines and mandated the continued use of a court-ordered map. The panel determined that the state's 2023 map violated the Voting Rights Act by confining Black voters to a single majority-Black district. They criticized Alabama's deliberate disregard for the court's order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred candidate. The ruling follows a February trial and is expected to be appealed by the state.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is claiming a limited victory with a new trade deal with the United States, amidst a series of complex trade agreements. While ministers are highlighting the real-world benefits of the deal, critics argue it primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a deep free trade agreement. The agreement avoids issues related to the NHS and food standards and does not dilute the UK's Digital Services Tax. The deal provides some relief for key UK industries, particularly car manufacturing and steel, but the full implications will depend on further details and future actions by the US.</p>

Trump proposes creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year and taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This change would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts. The president believes a tax increase on the rich would help protect Medicaid, a healthcare program for the poor, as Republicans prepare to cut spending on the program to offset the cost of tax cuts.</p>
