          <h2>Meta AI Users Can Now Prevent Prompt Sharing on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 17:06:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta AI users concerned about privacy can now adjust settings to prevent their prompts from being shared publicly on Facebook and Instagram. The company spokesperson emphasized that Meta AI chats are private by default, and public sharing requires a four-step process with a pre-post preview and the option to hide posts. To adjust privacy settings, users can navigate to the 'data and privacy' section in the app, then to the 'suggesting your prompts on other apps' tab to toggle sharing preferences for Facebook and Instagram. Users can also manage their information to make all public prompts visible only to themselves and delete their prompt history. The company has invested heavily in AI, including a $14 billion investment in startup Scale AI, to enhance its offerings and compete with other tech giants. The optimism score for this article is moderately high, reflecting the empowerment of users to control their privacy on Meta's platforms.</p>

          <h2>Dak Prescott Prioritizes Super Bowl Pursuit Over Legacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 16:57:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stated that his primary focus is winning a Super Bowl, rather than securing his personal legacy. Entering his 10th season with the Cowboys, Prescott acknowledges the past decade has gone by quickly and expresses gratitude for the opportunity to play the game he loves. With changes to the team's roster and coaching staff, including the addition of wide receiver George Pickens and the promotion of Brian Schottenheimer to head coach, Prescott is determined to improve upon the team's previous season's record. Prescott missed nine games last season due to a hamstring injury, and the Cowboys failed to reach the playoffs. His commitment to winning a championship for his personal well-being and the team contributes to a moderately high optimism score.</p>

          <h2>JBS Shares Rise in U.S. Public Debut Amid Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS experienced a rise during their U.S. public market debut on Friday, valuing the company at roughly $30 billion. JBS operates a sprawling business worldwide, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns more than 80% of Pilgrim's Pride, the U.S. poultry giant. The company's history of corruption and bribery allegations has faced opposition from lawmakers, including a $3.2 billion fine in 2017 for bribery charges. The SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April, and shareholders approved the move by a narrow margin the following month. The rise in shares indicates investor confidence despite the company's controversial past, contributing to a moderate optimism score.</p>

          <p>George Mills broke the British 5,000m record, surpassing a record previously held by Mo Farah. Despite finishing fourth in the race, Mills' performance was a significant achievement. His father, Danny Mills, noted that George has grown up in a family environment that emphasizes continuous improvement. While Mills was overtaken in the final stretch, his performance laid down a marker in a race which turned into an assault on the world record. This achievement contributes to a high optimism score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, indicating a swell of optimism as President Donald Trump rolled back some tariffs in recent weeks. The resurgence of shopper attitudes ended six consecutive months of worsening sentiment. Year-ahead inflation expectations dropped sharply from 6.6% last month to 5.1% in June. While economists are not always correct, the improvement of sentiment was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, wealth, political party and geographic region. (not investment advice) The improvement in consumer sentiment and easing of tariffs contributes to a moderately high optimism score.</p>
