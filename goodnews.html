          <h2>Trump Hints at Potential Tariff Reduction on Chinese Goods Amid Trade Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:39:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested a possible reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% ahead of trade talks in Switzerland, a shift from the previously announced tariffs of up to 145%. The upcoming meeting marks the first publicly acknowledged discussion between the U.S. and China since the trade war intensified, with China claiming the U.S. initiated the talks. Analysts suggest that a reduction to 50%-60% is expected, and failure to meet these expectations could negatively impact markets. UBS analysts anticipate tariffs settling around 34%, indicating a constructive tone for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction in 1972, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, is likely to survive the atmospheric dive, with potential debris reaching the surface. Despite the uncertainty, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, and any recovered pieces legally belong to Russia.</p>

Kari found a journal entry by Maribeth expressing gratitude for her loving family, which inspired the Coxes to continue fostering children despite their grief.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California public health officials have announced the annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels along the West Coast from Oregon to the Mexican border, effective through October 31. The quarantine warns against consuming mussels due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. These toxins accumulate in mussels during algae blooms, making them dangerous to eat, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the risk. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to frequent testing.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Left-Handedness to Higher Risk of Certain Neurological Disorders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that left-handedness and mixed-handedness may be associated with certain psychiatric and psychological conditions, particularly those affecting language or neurodevelopment, such as schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD. Researchers analyzed data from over 200,000 individuals and found that people with autism are 3.5 times more likely to be left-handed. While the study identifies a correlation, it does not establish causation, and experts caution against drawing conclusions that being left-handed implies a person will develop these disorders. The findings may offer insights into brain organization and development, potentially aiding in neurorehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked, allegedly due to a column she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, aside from the op-ed, and highlighted declarations attesting to her peaceful character. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was targeted for her views, while the Department of Homeland Security claimed she supported Hamas, a claim the judge dismissed.</p>

The purchases are the first from Australia since last year, with wheat shipments slowing after large domestic harvests. Despite China's large wheat inventories, concerns over crop damage have prompted the increased imports. Chinese buyers are likely avoiding U.S. wheat due to ongoing tariffs and trade war.</p>
