          <h2>Trump Administration Pauses Social Security Benefit Cuts for Defaulted Student Loans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a temporary halt to its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. An Education Department spokesperson stated the administration's commitment to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on fixed incomes. This decision marks a reversal from the administration's announcement in April that it would resume collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio, ending a nearly half-decade pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pause provides older borrowers with defaulted loans an opportunity to become current and avoid reduced benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eaglet Sunny, part of the Big Bear bald eagle family monitored by a live webcam, has successfully fledged, taking her first flight from the nest. The event thrilled viewers of the webcam, with sibling Gizmo observing Sunny's departure. While it's bittersweet for observers, Sunny remained nearby, perching in a tree close to the family's nest. Parents Jackie and Shadow will continue to protect and provide food for Sunny for several weeks or months as she adjusts to independence, while Gizmo has yet to fledge.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two shark divers from South Florida who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. had been convicted in 2022 for theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they freed the animals, believing the line was illegal. The pardons erase their felony convictions, restoring their rights to vote, own firearms, and travel freely. The divers spotted the longline off Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and reported the incident to wildlife officials.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing the success of Pop Mart, the company behind the collectible character Labubu, to that of Sanrio and its Hello Kitty property. Labubu, a popular plush clip-on charm, has attracted high-profile fans and boosted Pop Mart's Hong Kong-listed shares. The character's popularity is driven by its appeal to universal emotions through strong design and clever marketing, opening doors for other Chinese brands to succeed internationally. International sales for Pop Mart have surged, particularly in the US and Europe, making it a favorite among investors.</p>

          <p>NPR is collecting data on songs parents sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that found singing to babies improves their moods and overall well-being. The study, which surveyed parents about their babies' happiness and crying patterns, indicated that frequent singing has a positive impact. NPR encourages parents to share their favorite songs and even upload recordings of themselves singing. The songs don't have to be traditional lullabies, as any song that allows a baby to hear a parent's voice is beneficial.</p>
