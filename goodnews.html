          <p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, his spokesperson confirmed. The diagnosis, announced in May, was characterized by a high-grade Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone, indicating a challenging prognosis. Despite the cancer's aggressive nature, its hormone-sensitive properties offer a viable treatment path, and the 82-year-old has stated he feels good as the treatment progresses. This update on his health follows his decision not to seek re-election in 2024.</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to challenges from streaming services and high ticket prices by fostering community and unique experiences. Filmmaker Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey operates as a non-profit, hosting special events to survive, while Vidiots in Los Angeles has successfully expanded from a film store into a non-profit theater and community hub. In contrast, New York's Metrograph demonstrates a for-profit model can succeed by offering a boutique experience with a bookstore, restaurant, and curated film programming, proving audiences still seek social cinematic experiences.</p>

Her images capture young women in challenging circumstances, from Venezuelan migrants to those who have faced gender-based violence, yet still exhibit joy and strength. The day is intended to recognize the limitless potential of girls and advocate for their rights and opportunities. Villasana hopes her photographs convey the message that with support and resources, girls are an unstoppable force for positive change.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's total investment in five major Japanese trading houses—Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo—has grown to over $30 billion. This represents a nearly 400% increase from the initial $6.3 billion investment revealed in 2020, driven by both additional purchases and significant stock price appreciation. The company has recently increased its stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi to over 10%, indicating continued confidence in these long-term holdings. Warren Buffett has previously stated that Berkshire intends to hold these positions for decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wales's Plaid Cymru party has announced a plan to offer new teachers up to £30,000 in incentive payments if they win the next Senedd election. The policy aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by making Welsh teaching positions more competitive with those in England. The payments would be targeted at trainees in priority subjects like math and science, as well as those who can teach in the Welsh medium. To receive the full amount, teachers would be required to work in Wales for at least five years after qualifying, a move the party believes will help retain local talent.</p>

          <p>Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival, Queen Camilla paid a warm tribute to her late friend, author Dame Jilly Cooper, who passed away at age 88. The Queen fondly recalled a humorous anecdote from a party where Dame Jilly declared her intention to "get so absolutely plastered." She also noted the author's fondness for the Vesper Martini, the cocktail famously invented for James Bond. The tribute was part of a broader outpouring of affection for the beloved "bonkbuster" novelist, with other literary figures like Sir Ian Rankin and Sir Salman Rushdie also sharing their memories at the festival.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired a 2.5% stake in electrical products manufacturer Atkore and is publicly urging the company's board to consider a sale. Irenic's move comes as Atkore faces significant challenges, including declining revenue, a falling stock price, and the recent unexpected retirement of its CEO. The firm argues that after a pandemic-era boom, Atkore's aggressive pricing strategy backfired, leading to increased competition and poor capital allocation into non-core ventures. Irenic suggests that a sale to private equity could unlock greater value than a standalone restructuring plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Exploring How to Productively Engage with the Emotion of Regret</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of regret as an unavoidable consequence of free will, suggesting that instead of avoiding it with a "no regrets" mentality, one can use it constructively. While looking back can feel like a refusal to accept the past, the emotion of regret offers a learning opportunity. By allowing oneself to experience the sadness, disappointment, or guilt associated with past mistakes, it's possible to gain new insights about oneself in the present. This process can transform regret from a purely negative feeling about what could have been into a tool for personal growth and future decision-making.</p>

          <p>The world is on track for a record grain harvest this year, highlighting a major human achievement: the dramatic reduction of large-scale famines. Thanks to the Green Revolution, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation, global food availability per person has steadily climbed for decades, making famines caused by crop failure exceptionally rare. While hunger and malnutrition persist due to affordability issues, modern famines, such as those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily the result of political failures and conflict that block access to an abundant global food supply. This progress remains threatened by climate change and trade restrictions.</p>

          <p>An injury-plagued Novak Djokovic was eliminated from the Shanghai Masters in a stunning upset by Valentin Vacherot, a qualifier from Monaco ranked 204th in the world. Vacherot won the semi-final match 6-3, 6-4 to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 finalist in history. Djokovic, who had been struggling with illness and received medical treatment for his back during the match, was visibly hampered throughout. Vacherot's historic run ensures he will break into the top 100 rankings for the first time, and he will now face his cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, in the final.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old woman, is sharing her story of survival after suffering an amniotic fluid embolism, a rare and often fatal complication during childbirth. While in labor, amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream, causing her heart to stop and her major organs to shut down. Thanks to the quick reaction of her nurse and a multi-disciplinary medical team, she was resuscitated, and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. Despite the high mortality rate and risk of lifelong complications associated with the condition, both Choate and her baby survived without long-term medical issues, a recovery doctors called miraculous.</p>
