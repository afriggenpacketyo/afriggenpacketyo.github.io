          <p>In a significant departure from the long-standing policy of immediate evacuation, the Los Angeles County Fire Chief is now backing a new approach to battling wildfires. The strategy involves training and equipping residents to stay behind and actively defend their homes, a recognition of the hard reality that there will never be enough firefighters to protect every structure during major fire events. This shift in official guidance is informed by instances where homeowners successfully saved their properties with simple tools like garden hoses, prompting the creation of community fire brigades.</p>

          <p>During an official event announcing the relocation of U.S. Space Command headquarters to Huntsville, Alabama, President Donald Trump engaged in some lighthearted college football banter. The president jokingly referenced the University of Alabama's recent stunning loss, which prompted a cheerful response from Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, the former head coach of rival team Auburn University. Tuberville took the opportunity to gloat that his former team had won their game, a moment of levity that drew laughs from the audience.</p>

          <p>Nearly twenty-five years after the 9/11 attacks prompted a major overhaul of aviation security, airlines are beginning to roll out a new safety feature mandated by Congress. New commercial aircraft are now being equipped with secondary cockpit barriers, which are essentially retractable gates that block access to the flight deck when the main fortified door is open. This additional layer of protection is designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the cockpit during vulnerable moments, such as when pilots need to use the restroom.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of assault, battery, and other claims in a civil lawsuit filed by a security guard who sought $24 million in damages. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleged that the artist spat on her and cut her face with a fingernail during a confrontation outside an obstetrician's office in 2018. Cardi B testified that the argument was strictly verbal and stemmed from her fear that the guard was filming her and would reveal her then-private pregnancy to the public.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, can resume her role at the agency after she was fired by President Donald Trump. The court's 2-1 decision upheld a lower court ruling, affirming that the president cannot remove FTC commissioners without cause, a legal standard established nearly a century ago to insulate such agencies from partisan politics. The ruling is a significant check on presidential power and a victory for those advocating for the independence of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google, ordering the company to share certain search and user data with competitors but stopping short of the harshest penalties sought by the Department of Justice. The judge denied the government's request to force Google to sell its dominant Chrome web browser and Android operating system. The decision bars Google from entering into exclusive contracts to be the default search engine on devices and is seen as a move to restore competition in the search market.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Power and the Palace" is making headlines with several notable claims about the British royal family's relationship with politics and its members' personal lives. Among the anecdotes reported by author Valentine Low are an account of Queen Camilla fighting off a sexual assault as a teenager and the late Queen Elizabeth II's private belief that the UK was better off remaining in the European Union. The book also delves into the Palace's shrewd negotiations over public funding and the government's desire for a "maximalist" coronation for King Charles.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, shooting fountains of lava up to 330 feet into the sky from its summit crater. This event marks the 32nd episode of the current eruption, which began in December 2024. So far, all lava flow has been contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, posing no immediate threat to surrounding communities but creating a spectacular natural display that is being closely monitored by scientists.</p>

          <p>Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, surged 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case. Investors reacted with relief as the decision, while finding Google held an illegal monopoly in search, did not impose the worst-case penalties sought by the Department of Justice. The court rejected the forced sale of the Chrome browser and Android operating system, leading to a market perception that the company had avoided the most damaging potential outcomes.

          <p>The landslide victory of Zack Polanski as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales signals a significant shift in the party's direction and could have wider implications for UK politics. This analysis suggests Polanski's brash, blunt, and distinctly left-wing style presents a new challenge to the Labour Party's left flank, which is already facing pressure from figures like Jeremy Corbyn. However, this new approach also risks alienating the Green Party's more moderate, rural voter base, which was crucial to its recent electoral successes.</p>
