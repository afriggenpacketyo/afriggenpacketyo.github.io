          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Shows Signs of Revival in Victory Over Red Sox</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite being without shortstop Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production, scoring five or more runs for the seventh time in their last ten games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who delivered a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who had multiple hits and a sacrifice fly. The performance provided a much-needed boost for the team's lineup ahead of the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on difficulties faced by international PhD students in the United States, such as funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are aggressively recruiting top science and engineering talent, offering competitive salaries to fuel their expansion and integration of artificial intelligence. This trend allows China's quant sector to secure the intellectual capital needed to grow in the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. The influx of talent is helping these firms compete with both local rivals and established global financial giants.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her ongoing trademark battle with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of 'nkd' salon, has been fighting the French firm since it opposed her attempt to re-register her business's trademark in 2022. L'Oréal argues that the 'nkd' name is too similar to its 'Naked' line of beauty products and could cause consumer confusion. After significant delays, a hearing with the UK's Intellectual Property Office has been scheduled, with Dowdeswell stating she feels ready to continue her fight despite the personal and financial toll.</p>

          <h2>UK's Warm and Sunny Spring Leads to Boom in Some Insect Populations</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal conditions for butterflies to thrive after a poor season last year. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying up wetland habitats. While this year has been a bumper one for some species, the long-term trend for the UK's flying insect population remains one of decline.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that these local ordinances unlawfully obstruct federal immigration enforcement. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker both praised the decision, affirming that the city's welcoming ordinance is lawful and enhances public safety by allowing police to focus on local community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases personal artifacts, such as letters from screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's daughter, and testimonies from those who named suspected Communists. The display examines the broad impact of the Red Scare on both Hollywood and the wider American society.</p>

          <p>A new analysis explores how President Donald Trump has integrated the sport of golf into his business and political strategies, a practice that sets him apart from previous presidents. For Trump, golf is not just a leisure activity but a venue for fierce competition, high-level networking, and deal-making. The article details how he has used his golf courses, including his properties in Scotland, to forge relationships with world leaders like Japan's Shinzo Abe and political allies like Senator Lindsey Graham. While his passion for the game is evident, golf also serves as a transactional tool for building connections away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, a species whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a recent effort, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only disease-free herd to an isolated, disease-free mountain range over 200 miles away. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is surviving and has produced new lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery in Texas.</p>

          <p>An article explores the validity and flexibility of widely accepted health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. While some experts emphasize the critical importance of certain targets, like achieving at least seven hours of quality sleep to reduce long-term health risks, others suggest more flexibility. For instance, one kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, drinking when thirsty is a sufficient hydration strategy. The consensus among experts suggests that while these benchmarks are useful guides, individuals should focus on consistency and adapting healthy habits to their own lifestyles rather than rigidly fixating on numbers.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on the unique physiological needs of female athletes, who were once treated as "mini-men." Researchers are studying how factors like breast biomechanics, the menstrual cycle, and a higher susceptibility to certain injuries, such as ACL tears, affect performance. This research is leading to practical applications, from custom-fitted sports bras that can improve running efficiency to teams tracking menstrual cycles to optimize training and reduce anxiety. The goal is to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and provide tailored support that improves both performance and long-term health for women in sports.</p>

          <p>Now with the Boston Red Sox, pitcher Walker Buehler took time to reflect on his seven-year tenure with the Los Angeles Dodgers before facing them for the first time. Buehler, a key figure in the Dodgers' 2020 and 2024 World Series victories, acknowledged that leaving was difficult but that he has enjoyed his time in Boston. He received his 2024 World Series ring from his former manager and teammates before Friday's game, a moment that drew cheers from traveling Dodgers fans. Buehler's departure came after the Dodgers opted not to extend him a qualifying offer, instead signing other high-profile pitchers.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired in the UK, some psychologists and social experts are arguing that reality television may have a positive impact on viewers. While often dismissed as superficial, the genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering a window into different social landscapes. Experts suggest that watching unfiltered interactions can help viewers understand different perspectives, overcome biases, and spark important national conversations on topics like coercive control and racism. Despite valid concerns about contestant welfare, these shows can serve as a tool for greater social understanding and self-reflection.</p>
