          <p>Cartier owner Richemont announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by robust demand for jewelry. Revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, totaling 5.17 billion euros, exceeding analysts' forecasts, with the Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, leading the growth. However, sales in specialist watchmakers experienced a decline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with full-year sales rising 4% to 21.4 billion euros. Richemont's chairman cautioned about ongoing global uncertainties requiring agility and discipline, while BofA Global Research noted potential headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to a framework that would allow the UAE to purchase advanced AI semiconductors from American companies, according to U.S. President Donald Trump. This agreement could involve the import of 500,000 Nvidia H100 chips annually, which would significantly boost the UAE's AI development capabilities. The move comes as the Trump administration plans to potentially rescind a Biden-era rule that imposed strict export controls on AI chips, raising concerns about the technology ending up in the hands of rivals like China. The UAE has been investing heavily in AI infrastructure, aiming to become a global technology hub.</p>

          <p>Japan's equities and long-term bonds saw record foreign inflows in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets amidst trade tensions initiated by President Donald Trump. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of Japanese assets, marking the largest net inflows since 1996, according to Morningstar. This shift was attributed to changing global investor outlook on the U.S. economy due to tariff shocks. With the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact future inflows into Japanese markets. The inflows were largely driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers.</p>

          <p>China's decision to hold trade discussions with the US in Geneva sends a clear message that it prefers a multilateral approach to resolving trade concerns. By having the meetings at the UN ambassador's residence in Switzerland, China signals that trade issues should be addressed through the World Trade Organization. The presence of Li Chenggang, a WTO expert, alongside the negotiating team further reinforces this message. While headline tariffs were reduced, these cuts largely reversed measures that were non-compliant with WTO rules, indicating that no true bilateral deal was struck.</p>
