          <p>England, Scotland, and Ireland have all advanced to the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals following an exciting second round of fixtures. Scotland secured their spot for the first time since 2002 by defeating Fiji, while South Africa achieved a historic win over Italy to also reach the knockout stage. The tournament featured thrilling matches, including a 31-31 draw between Australia and the United States, and memorable moments for underdog teams like Samoa and Brazil, who scored their first World Cup points and try, respectively. Wales, despite a youthful side showing promise, bowed out after a defeat to Canada.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged nearly 19% after reporting better-than-expected net income for its June quarter. The robust performance was driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit, fueled by strong artificial intelligence demand, and a continued revival of its e-commerce business. Cloud revenue jumped 26% year-on-year, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Despite heavy investments in competitive "quick commerce" and a decrease in income from operations, investors were optimistic, leading to a 40% rally in its US-listed stock this year.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, advocating for enhanced artificial intelligence cooperation among member states and explicitly denouncing a "Cold War mentality." The summit, the largest to date, gathered over 20 foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Xi underscored China's self-portrayal as a global peacemaker amidst persistent trade tensions with the United States and ongoing conflicts. He pledged significant investments and educational support for SCO countries, aiming to foster high-quality development and cooperation. The meeting also saw Xi affirming the importance of India-China relations, with analysts suggesting improved ties could bolster Beijing's influence and further global multipolarity.</p>

          <p>Former England and Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has stated that this season could be a "now or never" moment for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, expecting him to deliver silverware. Rooney's comments followed Arsenal's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, where Dominik Szoboszlai scored the winning goal. While acknowledging Arsenal's quality, Rooney believes Liverpool remains the Premier League title favorite due to their experience in winning the league. He also criticized Arsenal's approach at Anfield, suggesting they should have been "a little bit braver" and taken the game more to Liverpool, rather than playing "to not lose them."</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's state-owned rail operator, has permanently abolished peak time fares starting September 1, offering significant savings for many passengers and aiming to simplify ticketing. This policy change, championed by the Scottish Greens, is designed to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, directly contributing to environmental goals. For instance, a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will be nearly 50% cheaper, and trips between Perth and Dundee will be a third less than previously. The move follows a previous pilot scheme that ended due to budget pressures but was reinstated by First Minister John Swinney, who highlighted its dual benefits for public finances and carbon emission reduction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in August, reaching its fastest pace in five months according to a private survey, defying economist estimates. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.5, indicating growth driven by a recovery in new orders and export business, partly attributed to an extended trade-war truce with the U.S. Despite this upturn, domestic demand remains weak, and employment in the sector continues to decline. Analysts caution that the durability of this improvement depends on export stability and a pickup in domestic demand, suggesting the economy is still under significant strain amidst ongoing price wars and capacity issues.

          <p>India is re-evaluating its foreign policy amidst US tariffs and growing geopolitical complexities, leading to a renewed engagement with China. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin signals a potential shift, driven partly by the Trump administration's imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian imports for not halting Russian oil purchases. This article explores India's "strategic autonomy" as it seeks alternative opportunities with the world's second-largest economy. Despite a significant trade deficit and lingering border disputes, the two Asian giants are taking steps towards normalizing relations, though this pivot could create new challenges for India's ties with other multilateral forums like the Quad.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit officially commenced with President Xi Jinping hosting leaders from its ten member nations, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Founded in 2001 as a Eurasian security bloc with six original members, the SCO has since expanded to include Belarus, India, Iran, and Pakistan, broadening its scope to encompass trade, economics, and cultural cooperation. This grouping is increasingly viewed as an Asian counterweight to Western influence. During the summit, leaders are expected to sign a declaration aimed at strengthening security, economic, and cultural cooperation, underscoring the bloc's growing role in global affairs and fostering dialogue among diverse nations on shared interests.</p>
