          <h2>US Mortgage Rates Remain Near Yearly Highs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 03:21:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to the highest levels of the year, according to Freddie Mac. This rate, while stable from the previous week, is lower than the 7.09% average from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors like global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season, as existing home sales declined in March, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, amounting to $26 billion, due to reduced oil prices and production. The company's free cash flow also decreased to $19.2 billion from $22.8 billion in the same period last year, reflecting continuing strain on the company's balance sheet. Despite the profit dip, Aramco increased its first-quarter base dividend by 4.2% year-on-year to $21.1 billion, while cutting its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024 to $200 million, a figure repeated for the first quarter of this year.</p>

          <p>The recent appointment of several individuals with business backgrounds to top cabinet positions in Germany's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has raised concerns about potential lobbying influences. Critics point to the new minister of economic affairs and energy, Katherina Reiche, and the minister for digitalization and state modernization, Karsten Wildberger, as examples of individuals with close ties to industry. Experts on lobbying regulation emphasize the need for stricter rules to prevent conflicts of interest, as Germany's lobbying regulations currently lack effective measures to curtail such issues.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that being a perfect mother is harmful and that flaws are an essential part of a mother's job. She encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are good enough, highlighting the importance of children learning that flaws are okay and to accept their own. She also acknowledges the historical tendency of psychiatrists to blame mothers for their children's problems and emphasizes the need to give mothers the credit they deserve.</p>
