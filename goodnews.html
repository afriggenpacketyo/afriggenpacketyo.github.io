          <h2>Ancient Chinese Burials Reveal Earliest Known Matrilineal Society</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 05:57:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological findings in Shandong, eastern China, have uncovered evidence of a matrilineal society dating back approximately 4,500 years. A Chinese-led team analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals from between 2750 and 2500 BC, confirming the existence of a Neolithic community that traced its lineage through the female line. The society farmed millet, raised animals, and possibly engaged in fishing, maintaining a stable lineage for at least 10 generations over 250 years. This discovery supports the hypothesis that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation, shedding light on early human social structures. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of ancient family organization.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new travel ban, which places restrictions on citizens from several countries entering the United States, has raised concerns about its potential impact on the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games, both of which will be hosted by the U.S. The policy contains an exemption that could apply to participants in these events, and organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics express confidence that the ban will not disrupt the Games or preparations. LA28 chair Casey Wasserman noted that the federal government understands the Olympics require special consideration and will be accommodating.

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a premarket surge following a period of turbulence fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a verbal exchange between the two. Trump initially praised Musk's handling of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but his tone shifted after Musk's criticism. The stock's rebound suggests investor confidence remains despite the tensions between the tech leader and the president, highlighting the complex relationship between political dynamics and market performance.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a five-year plan to enhance the country's infrastructure resilience against disasters, with a budget exceeding 20 trillion yen ($139 billion). The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and specifies 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. This initiative responds to prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake and the formation of a large sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture. The plan allocates funds for maintaining vital services, repairing sewer pipes, reinforcing bridges, and improving disaster prevention infrastructure, including erosion control dams and river embankments. These efforts aim to enhance disaster preparedness and mitigate the impact of increasingly severe weather events.</p>

          <p>A recent jobs report is expected to indicate a slowdown in job growth for May, influenced by President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Economists predict the U.S. added 125,000 jobs, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000, as Trump rolled back some "Liberation Day" tariffs. Trade agreements, such as the one with China, have impacted the economic outlook, leading to softened forecasts of a downturn. However, uncertainty remains due to ongoing tariffs and potential effects on consumer spending and company performance. The unemployment rate remains historically low, but the labor market's resilience is being tested by trade-related economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that enables aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radio signals. The technology, detailed in China's Journal of Radars, uses a "space-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method" to detect moving vehicles with crystal clarity, even in complex environments. This innovation overcomes challenges caused by reflections from land, sea, or buildings, allowing for silent tracking. The silent Cessna was able to detect all three moving vehicles with crystal clarity. This advancement has significant implications for military surveillance and reconnaissance.</p>

The regulations will mandate developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. Miliband said the move was "just common sense" adding that solar panels would save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could harm government efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>
