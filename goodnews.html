          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have achieved 'substantial progress' in trade talks held in Geneva, with details to be released soon. The talks aimed to de-escalate the trade war initiated by the US, which has seen both countries imposing steep tariffs on each other's imports. While specifics of the agreement remain undisclosed, it is anticipated to ease financial market concerns and address national security issues related to trade practices, potentially leading to the reduction of tariffs and the resolution of trade imbalances between the two economic powers. The US has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with 125% tariffs on some US goods.</p>

          <p>The US and Iran have completed a fourth round of discussions in Oman regarding Tehran's nuclear program, with both sides agreeing to reconvene. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff described the talks in Muscat as encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi found them 'difficult but useful.' The US insists Iran must cease uranium enrichment to prevent nuclear weapons development, a goal Iran denies pursuing. These talks follow President Trump's withdrawal from a prior nuclear agreement in 2018 and his warning of potential military action if the current negotiations fail.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has temporarily banned chess due to concerns that the game encourages gambling. Officials stated that the suspension will remain in effect until the game's compatibility with Islamic law can be determined. This action is part of a series of restrictions imposed by the Taliban since seizing power in 2021, reflecting their strict interpretation of Islamic law, with women already facing significant limitations in sports participation. The decision has affected local businesses, as chess competitions were a source of activity for young people.</p>

          <p>European officials are holding firm on food safety standards, which are seen as a 'red line' in trade negotiations with the US, as the Trump administration pushes for greater access for American agricultural products like beef and chicken. European regulations, including a ban on hormones in meat production, are at odds with American practices, leading to a potential trade conflict. While the US argues that American meat is superior, Europeans prioritize hormone-free, grass-fed products and maintain strict health and safety standards to protect their food culture and smaller family farms. The EU is willing to make other concessions to avert a trade war, but not when it comes to food safety.</p>
