          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index soared to a new record, driven by investor optimism following positive U.S. inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Tech investment giant SoftBank Group was a major contributor, with its stock jumping nearly 10% after a report of a massive cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, with which SoftBank is jointly involved in the Stargate AI initiative. While the Nikkei saw significant gains led by energy and utilities, other regional markets like Hong Kong and mainland China experienced declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has inaugurated the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, significantly reducing travel time between the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou. The 10.3km structure is a major engineering feat, as it is the first to integrate an expressway, a local road, and an intercity railway on a single crossing. Its design features an innovative asymmetrical lower deck to balance the different weights of the high-speed railway and the conventional road. The bridge represents a significant advancement in China's infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating an incident at the Port of Long Beach where approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel during offloading. The mishap resulted in a minor oil spill from a damaged clean-air barge, one worker sustaining a sprained ankle, and significant waterlogged cargo. The U.S. Coast Guard has established a safety zone and is working to recover the containers, which held general goods like furniture and electronics. While the cause remains unknown, officials stated the port remains fully operational despite the disruption.</p>

          <h2>China Pursues a Practical, State-Driven Strategy for AI Development</h2>

          <p>China is adopting a focused and pragmatic approach to artificial intelligence, contrasting with the massive private investment model seen in the U.S. Beijing has launched a national AI fund and is implementing its "AI+" initiative to integrate the technology across key sectors like the power grid and industry. Chinese officials believe their strategy of focusing on practical applications is effective even with restricted access to the most advanced chips, arguing their current hardware is sufficient for their goals. This state-led consolidation of resources aims to achieve significant, targeted advancements in AI deployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Capital A, the parent company of Malaysian airline AirAsia, has confirmed it is in active discussions to purchase the C919 passenger jet from China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac. This potential deal marks a significant step for the Chinese aircraft, as AirAsia would be the first foreign airline to formally work towards acquiring the C919. The single-aisle jet is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, and growing interest reflects expanding economic and travel connections between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Following a successful initial public offering where its stock climbed 14.5% on the first day, financial technology company Klarna is still a recommended buy, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer. He noted that despite the initial surge, the company's valuation has not yet reached excessive levels and its fundamentals, including improving profitability and strong growth, are encouraging. Cramer highlighted Klarna's diverse revenue streams beyond its well-known "buy now, pay later" service, though he noted the IPO primarily benefited existing shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional "stand and stir" television cooking shows are experiencing a sharp decline in commissions, with major broadcasters producing far fewer new programs. This trend coincides with the explosive growth of food content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where influencers can react to trends almost instantly. Analysts suggest that the high production costs, regulatory compliance, and slower pace of television cannot compete with the authenticity, speed, and direct community engagement offered by online creators. This shift reflects a broader cultural change in media consumption towards more raw, user-generated content.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer reflected on the changes in market psychology over the past three decades. He recalled the early days of the show in the 1990s, when there was widespread optimism and excitement among individual investors, a sentiment he believes is returning to the market today. Cramer noted that after the dot-com bust, many investors shifted to index funds out of fear, but now sees a renewed interest in single-stock rewards. He credited the show with helping to democratize access to market information for everyday people.</p>

          <p>A White House official has emphasized the need for the United States to actively defend its leadership in artificial intelligence against rapid advancements from China. The official stated that the U.S. lead has narrowed significantly and proposed exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks" to allied nations. This strategy involves providing not just hardware like chips, but also integrated algorithms and applications, to build a global ecosystem around American technology. The goal is to prevent China from gaining global market share and to strengthen technological alliances with partner countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Scientists hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA," the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose function is largely unknown. This mysterious DNA, which is three times more abundant in peacock spiders than in humans, might enable them to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By studying this extreme case of variation, researchers hope to gain broader insights into the evolutionary processes that create biodiversity across the natural world.</p>
