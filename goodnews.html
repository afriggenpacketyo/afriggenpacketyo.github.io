          <p>Climate activists in the U.S. are organizing a national "Sun Day" to advocate for solar power and energy efficiency, pushing back against the Trump administration's extensive rollbacks of climate protections. Led by Bill McKibben, the event aims to showcase renewable energy solutions, such as solar panel installations and electric school bus fleets, rather than traditional protests. Organizers acknowledge criticisms that the optimistic tone might seem out of sync with current environmental challenges but believe it fosters hope and attracts new allies to the climate movement, including conservatives interested in independent power supplies. The initiative seeks to accelerate the transition to fossil-free energy despite federal opposition, recognizing its crucial role in catching up with global warming's physics.</p>

          <p>Renowned actor Sylvester Stallone expressed profound humility and disbelief after receiving a prestigious Kennedy Center honor, an award he described as something he never anticipated achieving. He told Fox News Digital that he would perform his work for free, making the recognition for his contributions to American culture deeply surprising and cherished. President Donald Trump, serving as the Kennedy Center chairman, personally oversaw the selection of this year's honorees, including country legend George Strait and rock band KISS, with an aim to reshape the celebration into a more star-studded event. Stallone also reflected on his current hit series, "Tulsa King," identifying it as the role most authentically reflecting his true personality and discussing the creative challenges of maintaining its quality for future seasons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three practical steps for adults to rediscover and integrate creativity into their lives, countering the societal tendency to abandon playful pursuits after childhood. It suggests tapping into past interests, keeping creative endeavors low-pressure, and sharing creations without the intent of monetization to foster genuine enjoyment and sustained engagement. Experts emphasize that unstructured, exploratory thinking from hobbies can enhance creativity in other life domains and provide emotional benefits, such as reducing sadness and anger. The article encourages individuals to prioritize creative activities by connecting them to their core identity, rather than viewing them as another skill to master or monetize, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling sense of self.</p>

Shu expressed profound pride in the company's growth and accelerating profitability over 13 years, stating he wishes to pursue new challenges and contemplate his next venture.

While beneficial for local consumers in the short term, economists warn that this could disincentivize producers from investing, potentially leading to reduced production, lower productivity, and even losses in quality, ultimately causing prices to rise again. The tariffs were imposed in response to the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the second day of his UK state visit, President Donald Trump traveled to Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence, for bilateral talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Following a ceremonial farewell from King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, the leaders were expected to discuss critical global issues including Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, its growing threat to NATO's eastern flank, and the expanding war in Gaza. This meeting marks a significant shift from the previous day's royal pomp and pageantry to substantive political and geopolitical discussions, culminating in a joint press conference later in the day, aiming to refine trade deals and address international conflicts.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, announced mixed fiscal first-quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share missing analyst expectations while revenue aligned with forecasts. Strong performance from its flagship Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse brands helped offset continued weakness in its fine-dining business, which saw a smaller-than-projected sales decline. The company raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to 7.5%-8.5% but reiterated its earnings projections, leading to a 6% dip in shares during premarket trading. Net sales climbed 10.4% to $3.04 billion, significantly boosted by the acquisition of Chuy's Tex Mex restaurants, demonstrating overall portfolio strength despite some segment challenges.

          <p>Intel's stock surged over 30% in premarket trading following the announcement that Nvidia will invest $5 billion in the chipmaker and collaborate on developing data center and PC chips. This "historic collaboration" aims to integrate Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem, laying the foundation for the next era of computing, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The investment, pending regulatory approvals, does not currently include manufacturing Nvidia chips at Intel's foundry. This significant partnership comes after Intel recently secured a 10% investment from the U.S. government, signaling renewed support and a strong rebound for the company after hitting decade-lows earlier this year.

          <p>This article examines the growing trend of individuals and even doctors using AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical information and second opinions, highlighting both its potential benefits and significant risks. While AI can process vast amounts of medical data and occasionally offer accurate diagnoses that human doctors miss, it also has a "stubborn tendency to hallucinate" and provide dangerously incorrect advice, such as suggesting toxic substances. Experts caution patients against relying on chatbots for direct medical advice due to privacy concerns and the difficulty in discerning factual from fabricated information. However, AI can be a valuable tool for understanding existing diagnoses or formulating questions for a doctor, enhancing patient-physician conversations without replacing professional care.</p>

          <p>New Zealand is undertaking a monumental conservation effort to save its unique flightless birds, like the kākāpō and takahē, from invasive predators introduced by human settlers. The country aims to eliminate all invasive predators by 2050, a project estimated to cost over $100 million annually, making it the largest invasive species removal project globally. To achieve this ambitious goal, New Zealand is increasingly relying on advanced technology, including AI-powered automated traps that identify specific species and genomic research to potentially develop gene drives that could prevent invasive animals from breeding. While facing significant challenges and ethical considerations, the initiative hopes to create thriving native wildlife populations and develop tools applicable worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio's new film, "One Battle After Another," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is a political satire and black comedy that aims to reflect the growing polarization and divisiveness in contemporary culture. DiCaprio, who stars as a paranoid ex-revolutionary, notes that the article doesn't have a singular central message but explores an "interesting undercurrent about extremism." The film, which has received warm critical acclaim for its "ferocious" and "swaggering" qualities, finds humanity in its flawed characters and touches on themes of dissent and not fitting in, which are particularly relevant in the current political climate. DiCaprio expressed that the film holds a mirror up to society's polarity.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in U.S. investment, expected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google are committing billions, aiming to deepen economic ties between the two nations. This positive news comes amidst challenges, including stalled steel tariff deals and pharmaceutical companies halting UK investments due to perceived difficulties, such as undervaluing innovative medicines. While a significant boost, the announcement contrasts with a domestic slowdown in investment and falling payroll numbers in the UK, reflecting a complex economic landscape.

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported 15.89 million visa-free entries by foreign nationals from January to August, representing roughly two-thirds of all international arrivals. This significant growth is largely attributed to new reciprocal visa-free agreements, notably with Malaysia, which saw 150,000 visa-free trips to China since July 17. Russia is also anticipated to become a major source of visa-free visitors, indicating a strategic effort by China to boost tourism and international exchange through relaxed travel policies. This surge in arrivals suggests a successful policy shift in attracting foreign visitors and strengthening regional ties, contributing positively to China's global engagement and economy.</p>

          <p>“Phasmagorica” is a unique, immersive séance experience at L.A.'s Heritage Square Museum, reimagined as art by composer-turned-magician BC Smith. Designed for both believers and skeptics, the event aims to recreate the feeling of late 1880s séances, focusing on historical context rather than illusions, with Smith purposefully absent from the room. Participants engage with spirit boards and scrying mirrors in pitch darkness, creating a deeply personal and unmediated encounter. The sold-out event taps into a modern search for connection and meaning, offering a safe space for personal exploration into the mysterious and the historical practices of communing with the deceased, ultimately transforming Smith into a "hopeful skeptic."</p>
