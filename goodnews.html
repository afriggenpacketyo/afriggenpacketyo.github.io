          <p>The Department of Education has confirmed that approximately $6 billion in federal education funding, which had been frozen by the Trump administration, is now being released. A spokesperson stated on Friday that the funds will support a variety of critical education initiatives across the country. These programs include funding for English language acquisition for students, professional development programs for teachers, and resources for adult education. The release of these funds marks a significant development for educational institutions and programs that rely on this federal support.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:43:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by the substantial revenue generated from his administration's tariffs. He suggested the payments could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, though specific details were not provided. The administration has collected around $100 billion from tariffs, which could rise significantly. While Trump also mentioned using the funds to pay down the national debt, economists note that recent tax cuts and spending are projected to increase the deficit, making the feasibility of both goals uncertain.

          <p>England's Joe Root scored a masterful 150 against India, moving him to second on the all-time Test run-scorers list, ahead of Australian legend Ricky Ponting. His 38th Test century anchored England's dominant performance at Old Trafford, helping the team reach 544-7 with a lead of 186 runs. Root's partnerships with Ollie Pope and Ben Stokes solidified England's control of the fourth Test. With two days remaining, England is in a strong position to secure a victory and win the series 3-1, as India struggled with injuries and tactical missteps.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has joined the ranks of the 20 most valuable U.S. companies, with its market capitalization reaching $375 billion. The company's stock has more than doubled this year, driven by strong investor confidence in its artificial intelligence capabilities and growing contracts with the U.S. government. In its last quarter, Palantir's government business revenue saw a 45% increase, contributing to a 39% rise in total sales. Despite its rapid growth, the company trades at a high forward earnings multiple, reflecting significant investor expectations for future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a typical Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) takes two to six weeks to close, it may be possible to complete the process in under two weeks. Success depends on the lender's efficiency, often favoring online institutions, and the borrower's preparedness with necessary documents like tax returns and pay stubs. A key factor in speeding up the timeline is obtaining an appraisal waiver, which allows lenders to use an automated valuation model instead of a lengthy in-person appraisal. However, a federally mandated three-day rescission period after approval makes closing within the same week nearly impossible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in the Texas Hill Country that killed over 130 people, numerous organizations are collecting donations to support recovery efforts. The fast-moving waters of the Guadalupe River washed away homes and vehicles, devastating communities like Kerrville and a girls' summer camp. Relief funds have been established by local community foundations to direct aid to vetted nonprofits and first responders. National organizations like the American Red Cross and Salvation Army, along with local groups and businesses, are also providing meals, supplies, and financial assistance to affected families.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses how to handle a friend who frequently makes disparaging comments about their own body, causing anxiety for the listener. Experts suggest first assessing the friendship's value and considering distancing oneself if the negativity is harmful. Alternatively, one could try to guide the conversation toward positivity by suggesting affirmations or asking how to provide genuine support beyond simple reassurance. The key is to set a boundary, explaining that the negative self-talk is distressing, and shift the focus to constructive actions or, if necessary, create space to protect one's own mental well-being.</p>

          <p>England forward Lauren James is recovering from an ankle injury and her availability for the Euro 2025 final against Spain on Sunday remains uncertain. James was substituted at halftime during England's semi-final win over Italy and has been a key player, scoring two goals in the tournament. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that James is receiving treatment and that they are giving her time to recover, hoping to have all 23 players available. Wiegman also addressed debates about her substitution strategies, explaining that such decisions are carefully planned but ultimately depend on the feeling during the game.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file employees. The legislation would offer a 3% corporate tax rate reduction to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of their workforce. Proponents argue the bill would expand ownership to millions of middle-class Americans, helping to address wealth inequality and foster employee loyalty. The plan is designed so the tax benefits would offset the costs of share dilution for participating companies. (not investment advice)</p>
