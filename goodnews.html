          <h2>Clean Energy Transition Hinges on Critical Minerals Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 15:12:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on the availability of critical minerals, such as lithium, copper, and cobalt, essential for technologies like solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. However, the uneven distribution of these minerals and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. The US is working to increase domestic production and secure access to these resources. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials and technologies to reduce dependence on critical minerals, but scaling these innovations will take time and investment.</p>
