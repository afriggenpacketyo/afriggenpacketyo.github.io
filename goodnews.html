          <p>According to former President Donald Trump, Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with a formal proposal to be delivered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a hostage release framework. A Hamas official stated the group is prepared to agree if the proposal leads to a complete end to the war. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Amazon has deployed its one-millionth robot and announced a new generative AI model, "DeepFleet," to optimize its robotic fleet's efficiency in fulfillment centers. The company states that these robots work alongside human employees, handling repetitive tasks and creating new technical roles. However, this expansion comes as Amazon and other tech firms reduce their workforce, raising concerns about job displacement due to automation. CEO Andy Jassy has acknowledged that while AI will create new jobs, it will also automate others, likely leading to a smaller overall workforce in the coming years.</p>

          <p>This opinion article praises former President Donald Trump for successfully pushing European NATO allies to commit to spending 5% of their GDP on defense, a significant increase. However, the author argues this achievement will be meaningless unless the U.S. rapidly accelerates its own arms production to counter the rearming of Russia and the strategic threat from China. The piece suggests that to truly secure the alliance, the Trump administration must expedite the delivery of new Abrams tanks, fix the Patriot missile shortage, and reform the bureaucratic arms export process.</p>

          <p>A veterinarian in Wisconsin successfully saved a severely injured bald eagle by using an innovative procedure involving a fish skin graft. The eagle, named Kere, was found with a deep leg infection, and euthanasia was initially considered the only option. Dr. Kimberly Ammann used sterilized cod skin, provided by the company Kerecis, to repair the wound, a technique more common in human medicine. After a 10-month rehabilitation, the eagle was successfully released back into the wild just before the Fourth of July, a symbolic moment for America's national bird.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is framing his climate policy as a direct solution to affordability issues, a strategy his supporters believe can build broad popular support. Instead of focusing on complex carbon taxes, his platform emphasizes tangible benefits like making buses free to reduce transit costs and carbon emissions simultaneously. His housing plan includes a rent freeze, which aims to prevent displacement and ensure residents are not priced out by the costs of green building upgrades. This approach connects environmental goals with immediate improvements to residents' quality of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While both are forms of digital money, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) like China's digital yuan have fundamental differences. The digital yuan is a state-issued currency, controlled by China's central bank and intended primarily for domestic retail payments. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued cryptocurrency tokens, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar and backed by reserve assets held by the issuer. This distinction in control, purpose, and underlying technology is central to the global debate over the future of digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American summer holidays, traces its roots back to the Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean. The word itself is derived from the Ta√≠no term "barabicu," which described the wooden frame used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa," which was first documented in print in 1526. Over centuries, this cooking style transformed and diversified as it spread through the U.S., influenced by various immigrant cultures to create the many regional varieties known today.</p>

          <p>The latest version of former President Trump's "big beautiful bill" includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor companies from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to further incentivize chipmakers like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced manufacturing facilities within the United States. The proposed tax break expands on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting Washington's ongoing bipartisan effort to onshore the chip supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. The bill must still pass the House before the new credits can become law. (not investment advice)</p>
