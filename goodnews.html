          <h2>Louisiana's Incentives to Attract Meta's Data Center</h2>

          <p>To secure Meta's $10 billion data center, Louisiana offered significant incentives, including a 20-year sales tax exemption. The data center, set to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, is expected to transform Louisiana's economy, though it will only create 500 permanent jobs. The state purchased the 2,250-acre site in Richland Parish in 2006, and Entergy plans to build three gas-fired power plants to meet the data center's energy needs. The project highlights the competition among states to attract data centers, despite their high resource consumption and low employment numbers.</p>
