          <h2>Chinese Exports Slump to the US Amidst Trade War, Southeast Asia Trade Jumps</h2>

          <p>New York Times article: Chinese exports experienced a significant decline in shipments to the United States in April due to President Trump's high tariffs. However, overall exports from China saw an increase, driven by a surge in trade with Southeast Asian countries. This shift indicates a redirection of trade as Chinese factories are increasingly leveraging their presence in countries like Vietnam and Thailand to fulfill orders destined for the United States, with Chinese exports to the United States plunging by 21 percent. The April data provides temporary relief for Beijing policymakers amidst concerns about the trade war's economic impact, but economists caution about potential unemployment spikes if factory orders continue to decline.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal to reduce or remove tariffs on certain goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While this is not a comprehensive trade deal, it reverses some of President Trump's tariffs on specific goods. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a limited number of UK exports, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped, though quotas may apply. The agreement also addresses pharmaceuticals, with both countries intending to negotiate preferential treatment outcomes, but leaves the UK's digital services tax unchanged.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports from the U.S. for steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a significant shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after President Trump imposed tariffs on Indian exports, pushing India to rethink its approach. Experts suggest that this could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its global market presence. However, concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing and the potential for a flood of U.S. goods into the Indian market.</p>
