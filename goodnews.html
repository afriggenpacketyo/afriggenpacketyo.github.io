          <p>A group of nearly 200 protestors, known as the We Are America march, has arrived in Washington D.C. after a 14-day, 160-mile walk from Philadelphia. The marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, aimed to unite a movement to hold political leaders accountable amid concerns over the Trump administration's actions. Along their journey through multiple states, they were supported by local communities with food and shelter. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a comprehensive package of climate and environmental legislation designed to lower electricity costs, stabilize gas prices, and support California's oil industry. A key component extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, which is expected to generate billions of dollars for utility bill relief and public transit projects. The package also includes a controversial bill allowing for new oil and gas wells in Kern County, a trade-off that has drawn criticism from some environmental groups. Additionally, the legislation aims to create a Western states electricity market to more efficiently share renewable energy resources like solar and wind power.</p>

          <p>The Canadian women's rugby team delivered a stunning performance, defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand Black Ferns 34-19 in the World Cup semi-final. This victory ended New Zealand's 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament and marked their first loss in a World Cup knockout game since 1991. Canada, who had to fundraise to even attend the tournament, dominated the first half and successfully held off a second-half resurgence from the defending champions. The result, described as "seismic," sends Canada to their first World Cup final since 2014, where they will face either England or France.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has thrown out President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and four of its reporters, citing its "decidedly improper and impermissible" length. The judge criticized the 85-page complaint for its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail," which violated federal rules requiring allegations to be simple and concise. The ruling noted that the first 79 pages of the filing were unnecessarily long for a two-count complaint. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended version of the complaint, with a new limit of 40 pages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, but a final agreement was not reached during a phone call on Friday. A White House official confirmed the advancement in talks, with Trump later stating a deal "is well on its way." The popular video app faces a potential ban in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divests its American business due to national security concerns. Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for the divestiture, expressing a desire to keep the platform operational in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has proposed a new community policing initiative that would require every police force in England and Wales to open counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. They suggest the plan could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they claim would save over £100 million. The policy was announced at the start of the party's annual conference as it seeks to appeal to voters concerned about crime.</p>

Durant originally invested in the cryptocurrency when its value was a small fraction of its current price, which is now around $116,000 per coin. The high-profile case has drawn attention to customer service challenges at the cryptocurrency exchange, prompting the CEO to promise improvements.</p>
