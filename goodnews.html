          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that Americans hold mixed opinions regarding the Trump administration's deportation program, with approval contingent on the perceived targets. A majority supports the program if it prioritizes deporting dangerous criminals, believing it enhances U.S. safety. However, support declines sharply if the program is viewed as targeting non-criminals or deporting an unexpectedly large number of people. Views on the program's economic impact are also divided, with more Americans believing it will weaken the economy, particularly those who think immigrants fill jobs Americans won't do.

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles for resolving disputes in the South China Sea, aiming to foster peace and cooperation in the region. These principles include resolving disputes through equal consultation, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving mutually beneficial outcomes through cooperation, and opposing external interference. China's expansive claims over the South China Sea are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs, particularly with the Philippines, near disputed territories.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the recent Holyrood by-election, alleging that the SNP's tactics pushed voters toward Reform UK. Swinney defended his remarks by stating that Labour's vote share had collapsed, and SNP data showed a surge for Reform. Labour's Davy Russell won the seat, defeating the SNP candidate. The by-election was triggered by the death of Christina McKelvie, who had held the seat since 2011.</p>
