          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is expected to make landfall in South Carolina early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding to the coastal regions of the Carolinas.

          <p>A growing number of young Chinese travelers, particularly recent university graduates, are fueling a boom in the cruise ship industry. These travelers are choosing cruises as a social and convenient way to vacation with friends and alumni groups, valuing the communal spaces and activities available on board. Entrepreneurs like Dong Wenxin are organizing group trips to destinations like Japan, with costs varying based on the ship's luxury. This trend reflects a shift in travel preferences among China's youth, who are seeking unique group bonding experiences.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 23:36:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority by April 2026, with a goal of up to 1,000 centers by 2028. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative builds on the concept of "Sure Start" centres from the early 2000s, aiming to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. While the government touts it as a "lifeline" for families, the opposition has questioned how much of the plan is new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores the Life and Enduring Legacy of American Author Mark Twain</h2>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," delves into the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey that would form the basis for his book "Life on the Mississippi." The passage captures Samuel Clemens's experience traveling incognito to observe the changes to the river and its culture, which had been the defining landscape of his youth. Chernow's book examines how Twain's early life in Hannibal, Missouri, and his time as a steamboat pilot profoundly shaped his identity and his iconic literary voice. The biography explores the complexities of the man who helped define American literature.</p>

          <h2>New Communist Party Regulations Suggest Xi Jinping May Be Delegating More Authority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 22:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently introduced rules governing the Chinese Communist Party's central commissions and leading groups may indicate that President Xi Jinping is delegating more power to his deputies. According to state media, the new regulations are designed to standardize the policy coordination and review process at the highest levels of government. These top-level organs are now directed to focus on "planning, discussing and checking on major matters." Some analysts suggest this move could be a strategic effort to streamline governance or potentially hint at a long-term succession plan within the party leadership.</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, signaling readiness for further negotiations. The proposed 60-day deal involves the release of 10 living hostages and 15 bodies held by Hamas. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that the changes Hamas is requesting are "unacceptable," though a negotiating team will still be sent to Qatar to continue talks. The development represents a potential, albeit fragile, step toward pausing the 20-month conflict that has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for a crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, delivering a show that was noticeably more family-friendly than her typical performances. While still showcasing her signature charm and biggest hits, including "Espresso," the singer toned down some of her racier lyrics and choreography. The review notes her impressive ability to command a large stage and connect with the audience, seamlessly switching between upbeat dance numbers and vulnerable acoustic moments. The performance demonstrated her professionalism and adaptability, solidifying her status as a major pop act.</p>

          <p>New images have provided the first complete view of a mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle, or ekranoplan, being tested on the Bohai Sea. The craft, similar in concept to the large WIGs developed by the Soviet Union, is designed to fly efficiently at high speeds just above the water's surface. This capability makes it useful for logistics, search and rescue, and personnel recovery in littoral zones, while also being less vulnerable to certain naval threats. The vehicle's development indicates China's interest in this technology for potential military and logistical applications.</p>

          <h2>Peak District Walker Sparks Debate by Kicking Over Stone Stacks to Protect Environment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A walker in the UK's Peak District has gained viral attention for posting a video of himself kicking over man-made stone stacks. The walker, Stuart Cox, argues the stacks are environmentally damaging, as people are taking stones from historic walls and natural paths, which disturbs wildlife habitats and can cause erosion. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust support his view, stating the stacks are "detrimental" to the area's historic and natural environment. While some have criticized his actions, Cox hopes his video raises awareness about this harmful trend.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many young people in the UK are struggling to find summer or part-time work, often facing the challenge of needing experience to get experience. Career experts advise applicants to highlight skills learned from non-work activities like volunteering, team sports, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple and tailored, and suggest that dropping off a CV in person can still be effective at smaller businesses. Preparing for interviews by researching the company and practicing answers can also help candidates stand out in a competitive job market.</p>

          <h2>UK's Lifetime ISAs Praised by Some Savers but Criticized for Punitive Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle, is drawing both praise for its benefits and criticism for its strict rules. LISAs allow individuals under 40 to save for a first home or retirement, with the government adding a 25% bonus to contributions. However, savers face a significant penalty if they withdraw money early for unapproved reasons or use it to buy a home exceeding the £450,000 price cap, a limit unchanged since 2017. Critics argue the penalty is unfair and the price cap is outdated, effectively punishing savers and deterring others from using the product. (not investment advice)</p>
