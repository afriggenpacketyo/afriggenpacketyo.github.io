          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone this month to strengthen its naval defenses against increasing pressure from mainland China. The drone, developed under the "Kuai Chi Project" by NCSIST, will undergo combat capability evaluations, with live combat testing planned for August. The defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, aiming to begin mass production of more than 200 of these vessels by 2026. Equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, the drones are designed to autonomously lock onto and strike enemy ships, reflecting Taiwan's focus on asymmetric defense strategies.</p>

          <p>Tariffs imposed on American goods have led to changes in Chinese restaurants, with some forced to remove popular dishes like salt-baked chicken feet due to rising costs. Geng Xiaoyun, a restaurant owner in Beijing, had to replace American chicken feet with alternatives from Brazil or Russia, which he considers inferior. He hopes to serve his American phoenix talons once again, pending changes in the global political landscape.</p>
