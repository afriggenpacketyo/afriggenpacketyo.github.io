          <h2>Chinese Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Exports Surge in the UK Despite Overall EV Export Decline</h2>

          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased by 32.6% year-on-year in the first quarter, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports have seen a massive surge of nearly 600%. This increase indicates a growing British interest in more affordable Chinese car brands, especially as they face lower import tariffs compared to the European Union. The UK has become a significant export destination for Chinese EVs and hybrid vehicles, with March seeing an astounding 1,849% year-on-year increase in hybrid EV exports alone. The article highlights the shifting dynamics in the automotive market and the increasing acceptance of Chinese automotive technology in the UK.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, totaling $26 billion, due to reduced oil prices and lower production volumes. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, reflecting the impact of global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty on energy markets. Despite the challenges, Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, emphasized the company's resilience and commitment to disciplined capital planning for the long term. The article notes that OPEC+ production cuts, aimed at stabilizing the market, and reduced dividend payouts to the Saudi government further strain the balance sheet amidst costly megaprojects and weaker crude prices.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and to recognize that being flawed is a crucial part of motherhood. She argues that children learn to accept their own imperfections by observing their caregivers' imperfections. The article addresses the societal pressures on mothers and the historical tendency within psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems. Dr. Ross concludes by urging everyone to give mothers a break this Mother's Day, emphasizing that they are already good enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained steady at 6.76% for the second consecutive week, close to the highest levels seen this year, but still below the 7.09% average from a year ago. Meanwhile, the rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages has decreased slightly to 5.89%. The article notes that mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season.</p>
