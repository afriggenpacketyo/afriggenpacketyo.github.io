          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that it tricked millions of consumers into signing up for its Prime membership and intentionally made the cancellation process difficult. The agreement, which marks a major victory for the FTC, includes $1.5 billion for customer refunds and a $1 billion civil penalty. As part of the settlement, Amazon must also simplify its cancellation process and provide clearer disclosures about automatic enrollment after free trials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rising cost of senior care, with nursing homes now exceeding $120,000 per year, is prompting many to reconsider the value of long-term care insurance. This type of insurance is designed to cover services that Medicare typically does not, such as assistance with daily activities like bathing and meal preparation, which make up the bulk of long-term care needs. Experts suggest that purchasing a policy sooner is advantageous, as premiums increase with age and health issues can lead to denial of coverage. This financial planning tool can help protect retirement savings from being depleted by unpredictable and substantial healthcare expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £5 billion investment program, "Pride in Place," aimed at revitalizing 339 communities across the country that have been historically "overlooked." The funding is intended for local projects such as boosting high streets, improving parks, and saving community assets like pubs and libraries, with spending decisions to be guided by local residents. The plan also encourages councils to block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops. Critics from the Conservative party argue the investment will be overshadowed by tax increases.</p>

          <p>Actor Billy Crudup, a two-time Emmy winner for his role as Cory Ellison on "The Morning Show," reflects on a career defined by taking on challenging and unconventional parts. He initially avoided typical leading man roles, opting for complex characters in films like "Almost Famous." Crudup credits his demanding stage work, particularly a one-man show where he played 19 different characters, with giving him the confidence for his television success. He notes that this stage performance is what caught the attention of Jennifer Aniston, leading to his casting in the popular Apple TV+ series.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is ending its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks and will transition nearly all 70 million recipients to electronic payments by September 30. Beneficiaries will now receive their funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a move the agency says will improve efficiency, enhance security, and save costs. While the shift was mandated by a 2025 executive order to digitize all federal payments, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other way to receive their benefits. Advocates have raised concerns for the "unbanked" population who rely on paper checks.</p>

          <p>HSBC, in collaboration with IBM, has successfully used quantum computing to improve the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions in a trial hailed as a "world-first" for the financial industry. By combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, the bank achieved a 34% improvement in estimating the likelihood of a trade being filled at a specific price. This breakthrough demonstrates the practical application of quantum technology to solve complex financial problems in over-the-counter markets. The success suggests that quantum computing is on the verge of providing a significant competitive edge in financial services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea women's football manager Sonia Bompastor has spoken out about the discrimination women face in the sport, revealing that she is often asked in job interviews if being a mother of four is compatible with managing a top club. She stated this is a question that "they will never ask to a man." Her comments came in response to a survey that found 78% of women working in football have experienced discrimination. Bompastor, who led her team to a domestic treble, emphasized that while progress has been made, there is still significant room for improvement in achieving gender equality in football.</p>

          <h2>Fear of Future Tariffs and Price Hikes Provides Unexpected Boost to U.S. New Car Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 12:43:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. new car sales have received a surprising boost as consumers rush to purchase vehicles out of fear of impending tariffs and higher prices. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast, citing stronger-than-expected demand driven by policy uncertainty. A recent surge in electric vehicle sales also occurred ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit. While this "pull-ahead" effect has benefited automakers in the short term, analysts expect sales to slow in the fourth quarter and into the next year as these incentives disappear and potential tariff costs are priced in.

          <p>The Indian government has signed a $7 billion contract with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to acquire 97 Tejas Mk-1A fighter jets. This move is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" initiative, aimed at modernizing the country's armed forces while boosting its domestic defense industry. The new aircraft are intended to replace India's aging, mostly Soviet-era MiG-21 fleet, which is being retired. The deal reflects the government's confidence in the indigenously developed Tejas aircraft as the future mainstay of the Indian Air Force.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign off on a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a full ban mandated by a bipartisan law. The agreement involves a "qualified divestiture" where Oracle will host U.S. user data and review the app's code for security. A consortium of American investors will take a majority stake in a new U.S.-based joint venture, though parent company ByteDance will retain a minority share. The deal structure aims to satisfy national security concerns by isolating TikTok's U.S. operations and algorithm from Chinese influence.</p>
