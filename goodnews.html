          <p>Ozeki Onosato continued his undefeated streak at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, securing a win against Gonoyama and maintaining his bid for yokozuna promotion.

The 21-year-old Hakuoho continued his pursuit of the Emperor's Cup, forcing out Ura in their match.

          <p>With NJ Transit engineers on strike, supplemental chartered buses will begin running on Monday from various Park & Ride locations to Manhattan and North Jersey. However, officials have warned that the bus service can only accommodate about 20% of train riders. The contingency plan is similar to one used during the 1983 transit strike, allowing commuters with existing rail tickets to use them on the bus service. Some commuters may also switch to existing bus routes or private carriers. The article describes the strike's potential impact and the alternatives available to commuters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by opulent displays and substantial economic pledges. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and the UAE committed to a $1.4 trillion investment framework. These gestures signal the Gulf states' desire to strengthen ties with the U.S. for business, military, and technological partnerships.

          <p>A cross-party group of lawmakers in Japan is urging the Defense Ministry to create an office dedicated to investigating unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs. The proposal, presented to the defense chief, emphasizes the need to address UAP sightings as realistic and serious national security concerns. The lawmakers suggest modeling the office after the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, calling for regular reports to parliament, public information disclosure, scientific data analysis, and threat identification.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at Georgia Tech University have discovered the complex fluid dynamics that enable flamingos' unique feeding behavior. The birds create vortices in the water using their beaks, heads, and feet to stir up and trap prey. The shape of their bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water, while their webbed toes create vortices that push food towards their bills. These findings could potentially be adapted to improve water filtration technologies, providing a human application to the natural phenomenon.</p>

It claims that injunctions should only apply to the named parties in a lawsuit, and that nationwide legal issues should be addressed through class-action lawsuits.

The film uses a family tree death order structure, linking the Skyview Hotel collapse in 1968 to the freak accidents that plague the protagonist and her family. Tony Todd reprises his role, connecting the film to its predecessors. While existential themes are present, the film mostly revels in the gleefully gory and low-brow thrills that are the hallmark of the franchise.</p>
