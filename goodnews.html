          <p>Kyodo News reports Japan has confirmed simultaneous operations by two Chinese aircraft carriers in the Pacific, raising concerns over Beijing's military activities. U.S. and Chinese officials held high-level trade talks in London, focusing on lifting export controls on rare earth minerals. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to boost Japan's nominal GDP to 1,000 trillion yen by 2040, and Japan and South Korea agreed to build stable ties in their first phone talks. Four Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members were injured in an explosion near the U.S. Kadena Air Base, and Tokyo police and prosecutors will forgo an appeal in an illicit probe case. Over 70 nations are expected to call for international plastic pollution reduction targets at the U.N. Ocean Conference, while sumo great Hakuho plans to promote the sport from outside the ruling body.</p>

          <p>WWE hosted a successful double-header in Inglewood, California, featuring the Worlds Collide event with AAA stars and the Money in the Bank event. Worlds Collide broke YouTube viewership records and celebrated Mexican wrestling, while Money in the Bank had mixed reactions, particularly regarding the winners of the ladder matches. Mr. Iguana from AAA became a social media sensation, potentially leading to future appearances in NXT. The return of R-Truth at Money in the Bank was a highlight, with many speculating the event was orchestrated to appease fan backlash over his release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2bn of investment to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, which is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while critics condemn the move as a costly mistake that will burden consumers. The project faces opposition due to concerns about costs and potential environmental impact, despite the government's insistence that nuclear power is crucial for the UK's energy security. The investment is part of a series of announcements leading up to the government's Spending Review.</p>

          <p>Many newspapers lead with Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments, after restoring the payment to most pensioners, with some calling for an apology. The Daily Express celebrates the U-turn as a victory for pensioners, while the Times highlights a stand-off between Reeves and the Home Secretary over police funding. The Guardian focuses on Labour's ¬£14bn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear plant, with Energy Secretary Ed Miliband declaring a new "golden age" for the British nuclear industry. The Financial Times features a photo of a damaged Waymo car from the Los Angeles protests and reports that hedge funds are targeting French companies facing restructuring.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has pledged to meet NATO's 2 percent spending threshold this year, seven years ahead of the previously scheduled timeline. The commitment involves billions in military spending, aimed at strengthening Canada's defense capabilities and fulfilling its obligations to the alliance.

          <h2>Lyndon Johnson's Federalization of National Guard Amid Civil Rights Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 18:38:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized Alabama's National Guard to protect civil rights advocates marching from Selma to Montgomery, marking a rare instance of a president acting without a governor's cooperation. Johnson's decision came after Alabama Governor George Wallace refused to ensure the marchers' safety, citing the likelihood of violence. Johnson invoked federal authority to deploy troops and safeguard the activists, emphasizing the federal government's role in upholding civil rights. The historical context underscores the significance of federal intervention in protecting constitutional rights during times of state resistance.</p>
