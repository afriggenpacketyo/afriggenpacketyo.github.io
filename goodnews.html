Norris recovered from an initial setback to finish second, while George Russell of Mercedes claimed the final podium spot after benefiting from a virtual safety car period. Ferrari experienced tension as Lewis Hamilton was allowed to pass Charles Leclerc to pursue Antonelli, though he ultimately failed to catch the Mercedes driver.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About the Risks and Costs of Relying on Egg Freezing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, some experts are cautioning women about relying on the medical procedure, citing its high costs and lack of guarantees. The process involves financial costs, medical risks, and a gamble that it will work, with success rates dropping as women age and the number of eggs frozen decreases. Some critics argue that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be doing so to retain female employees rather than to help them, and that the emphasis on profits in private equity-backed fertility companies is creating warped incentives.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among women to preserve their fertility, but it is an expensive procedure with no guarantee of success. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, with a single cycle costing thousands of dollars. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket, and experts caution that it does not ensure a woman will be able to have a child. Women are encouraged to discuss egg freezing with their gynecologists to make informed decisions about their fertility options.</p>
