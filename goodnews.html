          <p>Roanoke College in Virginia has reinstated its varsity football program for the first time since 1942, aiming to increase overall student enrollment, particularly among men. Administrators hope the addition of football, a marching band, and a cheerleading team will enhance campus spirit and attract more students in a competitive academic landscape. While research suggests that adding football provides only a short-term spike in enrollment, Roanoke has already seen its incoming freshman class become over 55% male. The college hopes this strategy, combined with new academic programs, will ensure its long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Child development and education experts are urging parents to proactively discuss the use of generative artificial intelligence with their children, as many teens use tools like ChatGPT without guidance. The advice is to start conversations early, explore the technology together, and teach critical thinking by fact-checking AI-generated responses. While AI can be a helpful learning aid if used correctly, experts also warn of significant risks, including the potential for chatbots to provide unsafe advice on mental health issues. They recommend establishing household rules and prioritizing real-world activities to ensure a balanced approach to this evolving technology.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court stated that the tech giant removed her account without a clear justification and applied its content moderation policies inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to review and clarify its terms of use regarding moderation decisions and its definitions of implicit sexual content. This decision underscores a growing trend in South America where courts are holding social media platforms more accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team is set to face England in a World Cup quarter-final, renewing a rivalry in which they have not defeated the English side in over 25 years. England's Red Roses have dominated the matchup, with an average victory margin of nearly 50 points in their last five meetings. This gap is attributed to England's superior investment, player pathways, and larger player pool. Despite being the underdogs and facing uncertainty over coaching and contracts, the Scottish team has shown significant improvement, rising to sixth in the world rankings and expressing belief in their ability to challenge the tournament hosts.</p>

          <h2>Boxing Experts Divided on Outcome of Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford Super-Middleweight Bout</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing analysts are offering conflicting predictions for the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford's supporters point to his superior technical skill, adaptability, and reach advantage, suggesting he can outbox the aging Álvarez, similar to how Floyd Mayweather Jr. did. Conversely, those favoring Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage, as Crawford is moving up two weight classes to fight at the 168lb limit where Canelo is the undisputed champion. The fight's outcome will likely depend on whether Crawford's slick boxing can overcome Canelo's raw strength and experience at the higher weight.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led, anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim prime minister. Karki is the first woman to hold the position and is known for her strong anti-graft stance. Her appointment, which came after negotiations involving the army and protest representatives, has helped restore calm to Kathmandu, with curfews being eased. The country's president has dissolved parliament and scheduled new elections for March 5, responding to the demands of the "GenZ" protest movement.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously boost its birth rate and scientific talent pool, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The initiative will initially cover the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, providing 20 new mothers with a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010). To be eligible, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have a senior professional title. While the program's initial scope is limited, it is being viewed by some as a positive step toward addressing two of China's major policy challenges.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships began in Tokyo with athletes battling grueling heat and humidity, as Japan celebrated its first medal with a bronze in the men's 35km race walk. The event marks the return of a major global sporting event with spectators to the city, four years after the Olympics were held in empty stadiums. Organizers moved up start times for road races due to temperatures climbing to 30°C with over 90% humidity, which still proved challenging for many competitors. Despite the difficult conditions, the home crowd provided an enthusiastic atmosphere, eager to support the athletes after the spectator-less 2020 Games.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer John Daly has set a new, undesirable record on the PGA Tour Champions by scoring a 19 on a single par-5 hole during the Sanford International. The two-time major champion reportedly hit seven consecutive shots into a water hazard on the 12th hole at Minnehaha Country Club. This score surpasses the previous record high for a single hole on the senior tour by three strokes. The incident also exceeded Daly's own personal record of an 18, which he famously carded at the 1998 Bay Hill Invitational after hitting six balls into the water. Daly finished the round with a score of 88.</p>
