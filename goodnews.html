          <p>United Airlines is partnering with JetBlue Airways in a new venture called Blue Sky, marking United's return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The partnership will allow JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United flights and vice versa, and includes reciprocal loyalty benefits like priority boarding. JetBlue's CEO Joanna Geraghty sees this collaboration as a significant step forward for the industry, providing more choices for travelers. This partnership differs from JetBlue's previous alliance with American Airlines, which was blocked on antitrust grounds, and does not involve flight coordination.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance promoted the Trump administration's efforts on stablecoin legislation at Bitcoin 2025, asserting that stablecoins do not threaten the U.S. dollar but rather act as a force multiplier for economic might. He highlighted the administration's pro-crypto agenda, months after receiving significant funding from the crypto industry. The GENIUS Act, a bill regulating digital assets, recently cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate. David Sacks, President Trump's crypto advisor, suggests a legal framework for stablecoins could generate trillions in demand for U.S. Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's shares surged after posting strong earnings, triggering a rally in global semiconductor stocks despite facing headwinds from U.S. chip export restrictions to China. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to these restrictions. Despite this, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations, alleviating concerns about demand for its graphics processing units.

          <p>Modernizing building codes to allow single-stair housing in the U.S. could lead to more affordable housing options, according to advocates. The U.S. has historically favored double-staircase apartment buildings, increasing construction costs and limiting design flexibility. Allowing single-stair construction could cut costs by about 10 percent and encourage developers to build more "missing middle" housing, including family-friendly units. While fire safety officials express concerns, advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair designs just as safe.</p>

          <p>Stock market investors are using the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out) to profit from President Trump's tariff policy, buying stocks after tariff announcements and selling after reversals. Trump's threats and subsequent delays have caused market volatility, but historically, he has often backed down from implementing tariffs. However, a court invalidated most of Trump's tariffs, adding another layer of uncertainty. This strategy highlights Trump's tendency to use bluster in policymaking, prompting investors to avoid panic during short-term market downturns.</p>
