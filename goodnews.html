          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White received a technical foul and a fine for yelling at officials during a game, and she has since suggested that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay for it. The incident occurred during a decisive win over the Las Vegas Aces, with Clark, who was sidelined by an injury, enthusiastically supporting her coach from the bench. This event is highlighted as part of a more rebellious and confident team culture emerging within the Fever during Clark's second year. The team recently won the WNBA's Commissioner's Cup, celebrating with a new sense of defiance and team unity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The act of crying at work is sparking a conversation about professionalism and emotional expression in modern workplaces. While some still view it as a sign of weakness that could hinder career advancement, many experts and employees now see it as a display of emotional intelligence and humanity. Executive coaches argue that compassionate employers who support staff through emotional moments are more likely to foster loyalty and productivity. The discussion highlights a cultural shift, questioning old-school norms and suggesting that authentic leadership, which includes showing vulnerability, can be a powerful tool in building a positive and effective work environment.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals, including copepods, gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before migrating hundreds of meters deep, where they burn their fat reserves. This process effectively sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million gasoline-powered cars, a much larger impact than previously understood. The findings highlight the critical but often overlooked role of these small organisms in regulating the global climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

          <p>Germany secured a victory against Poland in their opening match of the Women's Euro 2025, with goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to team captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of two previous ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, leaving her participation in the rest of the tournament in significant doubt. While the team's performance was solid, the loss of their captain casts a shadow over their campaign as they prepare to face Denmark.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has identified five 'toxic' food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of nitrates and sodium. He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods to establish healthier lifelong eating habits.</p>
