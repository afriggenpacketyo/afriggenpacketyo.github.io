        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London have been disrupted due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, affecting services until 14:00. Some services originally scheduled to start in Glasgow are now commencing in Preston, Lancashire, leading to delays of several hours. Ticket holders are advised to use alternative services on the east coast rail line without extra cost or request a refund. Network Rail Scotland stated that repairs are underway and the line is expected to reopen around 11:30.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two critical mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, one being the decision to have Max Verstappen give back a position after contact with George Russell in Turn One. Team principal Christian Horner stated that the decision was based on recent experiences and perceived penalties, but stewards later ruled no further action was necessary. The second mistake was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision Verstappen questioned, and Horner admitted they should have left him on soft tires. The article analyzes the racing guidelines and Red Bull's misjudgments during the race.</p>

          <p>Politicians often operate with a degree of shamelessness, justifying changing positions due to shifting political winds, party loyalty, or donor pressure. The article explores how politicians, including Donald Trump, navigate these situations, sometimes offering explanations that are transparently insincere. Ross Douthat argues that Trump's willingness to contradict himself is part of his appeal, reassuring voters that extreme positions are provisional. The article also examines how different politicians are perceived when engaging in similar actions, highlighting the role of media coverage and party affiliation.</p>
