          <p>China has started mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip, developed by Professor Li Hongge's team at Beihang University. This breakthrough overcomes limitations in traditional computing by merging binary and stochastic logic, enabling fault tolerance and power efficiency. The new chip technology aims to address the power and architecture walls faced by current chip technologies. The Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers, potentially offering a more efficient alternative for intelligent control applications.</p>

The NHS also stressed the need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types that can help treat people with sickle cell disease.</p>
