          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected Q3 revenue, with its stock rising 6% after hours, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs. This positive report follows a significant $8.9 billion investment from the U.S. government and a $5 billion deal with Nvidia to integrate AI graphics processors. Despite some accounting complexities due to the government's stake and a warning of potential future revisions, Intel forecasts strong Q4 revenue and anticipates continued high demand for its chips through next year. The company is also heavily investing in its Intel Foundry division, aiming to secure major customers and revive growth in its data center CPU business, despite the substantial capital required.

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, following a constructive conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech leaders. Mayor Lurie cited recently released crime statistics showing significant declines across the city, including nearly 30% citywide crime reduction and historic lows for violent crime and homicides, as evidence of San Francisco's substantial progress. This decision follows earlier controversy ignited by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's call for federal intervention, which he later apologized for. Governor Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the reversal, emphasizing the importance of local leadership in addressing public safety concerns and preserving the city's values.</p>

          <p>Undefeated boxer Jaron "Boots" Ennis, boasting a 35-0 record, is confidently pursuing the title of boxing's next best pound-for-pound fighter after recently securing an interim WBA junior middleweight belt. Ennis attributes his exceptional comfort and unwavering confidence in the ring to his family's deep boxing roots, including his father and trainer, Derek "Bozy" Ennis, and his professional boxer brothers who laid his foundation. He embraces the high expectations, aiming to become a multi-division champion and solidify his legacy in the sport, rather than being compared to others. Ennis asserts his unique style while aspiring to match the impact of current boxing greats.</p>

          <p>Dataland, envisioned as the world's first museum dedicated to AI arts, has announced a delay in its grand opening in downtown Los Angeles, pushing it back to spring 2026. Designed by media artist Refik Anadol, the expansive 25,000-square-foot museum will feature five discrete galleries, including a re-imagined Infinity Room. This immersive space will offer a multisensory experience, combining Anadol's signature swirling visuals with AI-generated scents, all powered by a unique Large Nature Model. Anadol's concept explores the transformation of architectural space into a living canvas through "machine hallucinations," building on his decade-long research into data as a narrative material for artistic expression.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have committed in principle to providing financial support for Ukraine through 2026 and 2027 but postponed a concrete funding plan until a December meeting. The delay stems from complex deliberations over the legal and financial risks associated with leveraging hundreds of billions in frozen Russian Central Bank assets as collateral for a massive loan. While Belgium, which holds most of these assets, has signed off on the general statement, member states like Germany still differ on how Kyiv should specifically utilize the funds. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has underscored the critical urgency of securing these resources promptly to defend against Russia's aggression.</p>
