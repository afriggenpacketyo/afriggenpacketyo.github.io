          <h2>Biden Dismissed Concerns About Mental Acuity Following Hur Report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity after Special Counsel Robert Hur's report raised questions about his memory. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to remember key details, such as when his son Beau died and when he left office as vice president. In response to the report, Biden asserted that he knew what he was doing and didn't need Hur's recommendation. The Hur report and Biden's performance in a June presidential debate led to calls for him to drop out of the race, which he did in July.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, blanketing the city and surrounding areas with dust and reducing visibility to zero in some locations. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time ever for the Chicago office and the first time including the city itself. The storm was caused by 60 to 70 mph winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust into the air. The dust storm caused ground stops at Midway International Airport and significant expressway backups, but skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, including standing ovations, investment pledges, and the UAE's highest civilian honor. Trump announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the US and these nations, which are major purchasers of American military equipment. The trip contrasted sharply with the backlash Trump faces at home over tariff policies and immigration, with gulf leaders praising his approach and echoing his slogans. The president also announced the lifting of sanctions from Syria in an effort to give the war-torn country a fresh start.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Wisconsin judge pleaded not guilty to federal charges of helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts. Judge Shelley Joseph in Massachusetts was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape ICE. While the charges against Joseph were later dropped, the case sparked debate about federal overreach and the balance between state and federal authority. Both cases highlight the complexities state judges face in balancing their courtroom prerogatives with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is expanding its influence through wealth and strategic investments. Emirati corporations are investing in key sectors such as ports, mines, and renewable energy projects across the continent. Since 2019, the Emirates has announced $110 billion worth of deals in Africa, surpassing amounts pledged by other countries. This push is part of an ambitious plan to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains, while the US is fast-tracking its exit from Africa by ending billions of dollars in funding and dismantling U.S.A.I.D.</p>

          <p>Following the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult's nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subway in 1995, dozens of abused and malnourished children were rescued from its compound. These children, separated from their parents and ruthlessly indoctrinated, were initially hostile and demanded to return to the cult, but a child welfare center provided a safe space for them to recover. The children gradually began to trust and play together, and reunions with parents who had left the cult helped break Asahara's grip. After three months, all 53 children were transferred to national child guidance centers, marking the end of their relationship with the center's staff.</p>

A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1, which features wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and manoeuvrability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase, adjusting its trajectory to engage targets. The Tianxing-1 operates similarly to hypersonic glide missiles, but travels at a slower pace, potentially limiting its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
