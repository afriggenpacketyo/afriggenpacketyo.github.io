          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little successfully made a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against Pittsburgh, a distance that would have set a new NFL record. However, because the kick occurred during a preseason match, it will not be officially recorded in the NFL's record books, which are held by Baltimore's Justin Tucker for a 66-yarder. Despite the unofficial status, the kick was celebrated enthusiastically by his teammates and highlights the rookie's powerful leg as a potential weapon for the team.</p>

The country offers a surprisingly low cost of living, with affordable rent and healthcare, and allows Americans to stay for up to one year without a visa, which is a rare benefit in Europe. Combined with its stunning natural landscapes and a welcoming local culture, Albania is becoming an attractive option for digital nomads and retirees seeking a high quality of life.</p>

Analysts point to factors like Chevron's Hess acquisition, Rithm's pivot to an alternative investment model, and AT&T's strategic reinvestments as reasons for their buy ratings.

          <p>A schoolboy in Scotland discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship on a beach in Sanday, Orkney, following a storm. Researchers and the local community worked together to preserve the oak timbers and identify the vessel. The ship was determined to be the whaling ship Earl of Chatham, which was formerly the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy ship active during the American Revolution. The vessel sank in a storm in 1788, but remarkably, all 56 crew members survived the shipwreck.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Psychology Behind Our Attraction to Negative News</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 08:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores why humans are often drawn to negative news, a phenomenon rooted in an evolutionary "negativity bias" that hardwires us to focus on threats. While the media's watchdog role contributes, our own psychology plays a significant part, often causing us to overlook stories of genuine progress. The piece argues that embracing realistic optimism and highlighting positive developments, such as falling murder rates or fewer deaths from extreme weather, is necessary to inspire action and build resilience against a challenging world.</p>

          <h2>Meteorite That Struck Georgia Home Confirmed to Be Older Than Earth</h2>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite called a chondrite, created a loud boom as it entered the atmosphere in June. This is the 27th meteorite recovered from Georgia, and researchers believe modern technology and public awareness will lead to more such discoveries, aiding in the study of potential asteroid threats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Airbus A340 was designed with four smaller engines instead of two larger ones primarily due to airline preferences and regulatory standards of its time. When developed in the late 1980s, many airlines, particularly those flying long over-ocean routes, preferred the redundancy of four engines for safety. Furthermore, early twin-engine jets faced strict ETOPS regulations limiting their distance from diversion airports. However, as twin-engine reliability and ETOPS ratings improved, the four-engine A340 became less popular due to higher fuel and maintenance costs.</p>

          <p>In her new book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her experience of living in a "middle place" of eating disorder recovery, between acute illness and a complete cure. After developing anorexia as a teen following her mother's death, she found the pursuit of a perfect, all-or-nothing recovery to be unattainable and shaming. Tarpley argues that embracing an imperfect recovery, where slips are normalized and accepted, has allowed her to live a full life while still making progress, a perspective she feels is more realistic and attainable for many.</p>

          <p>This article explores ethical food choices for individuals who want to reduce animal suffering but find a strict vegetarian or vegan diet difficult due to health or other reasons. Instead of an all-or-nothing approach, it suggests a "reducetarian" diet, focusing on choices that cause less harm. Recommendations include opting for pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, eating larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, and being mindful of misleading welfare labels on food packaging.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece advocates for the Trump administration's directive for NASA to place a nuclear reactor on the moon, arguing it is essential for establishing a permanent human settlement. A lunar base would require significant energy for life support, and solar power is insufficient during the 14-day lunar nights. The author suggests that geopolitical competition with China, which is also planning a nuclear-powered lunar base, provides a necessary spur for the U.S. to advance its space exploration goals and create a global commons for research.</p>

          <p>As California wildfires grow faster and more intense, some emergency response experts argue that community fire shelters are a necessary life-saving strategy when evacuation is not possible. Citing examples from the 2018 Camp fire where over 1,200 people found refuge in makeshift safety zones, researchers are pushing to develop official standards for such shelters. Institutions like Pepperdine University have already adopted a "shelter-in-place" policy, using fire-resistant buildings and extensive brush clearance to protect students during firestorms.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California water agencies are planning for a more resilient future. To avoid a "Day Zero" crisis similar to what Cape Town faced, leaders are investing in a diversified portfolio of local water sources. Key strategies include a major wastewater recycling project in Carson, increased stormwater capture, and continued conservation efforts to ensure the region of 19 million people has a sustainable and affordable water supply.</p>

          <h2>As Flooding Worsens, Cities Look to 'Sponge City' Model for Solutions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities like Bangkok and Los Angeles are increasingly looking to the "sponge city" concept to combat chronic flooding exacerbated by climate change. This approach uses nature-based solutions, such as wetlands and permeable surfaces, to absorb and manage stormwater rather than flushing it away through concrete channels. Pioneered in China, the model aims to make urban areas more resilient by retaining, slowing, and reusing rainwater, which helps mitigate flood risk, replenish groundwater, and create valuable green spaces for communities.</p>
