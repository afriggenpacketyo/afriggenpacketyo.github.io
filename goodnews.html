          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration and Florida to cease operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Everglades, citing environmental concerns. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction that blocks the transfer of new detainees and halts further construction, requiring the removal of temporary structures within 60 days. The judge found that officials violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to conduct necessary reviews, risking irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem. Environmental groups praised the decision as a significant victory for the protection of the Everglades.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, where markets expect him to signal a potential interest rate cut in September. The address comes amid significant political pressure on the Fed from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly called for lower rates and criticized the central bank's policies. Powell is expected to discuss the economic outlook and the Fed's long-term policy framework, balancing concerns over inflation with recent signs of a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The cautious sentiment followed a five-day losing streak for the S&P 500 in the U.S. market.

          <p>Law enforcement has removed a massive illegal marijuana cultivation site from a remote area of Sequoia National Park, clearing nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash. The operation caused severe environmental damage, including diverting a creek and contaminating the soil with hazardous pesticides like methamidophos, which is banned in the U.S. and highly toxic to wildlife. Officials noted that such grows, often run by organized drug-trafficking groups, have been a persistent problem in the region for decades, posing a threat to the delicate ecosystem and public safety.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance urging baby food manufacturers to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidelines also call for companies to stop promoting snack foods for babies under one year of age and to restrict marketing claims that suggest unproven health benefits. This move follows a BBC investigation that found some popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. While the guidelines are currently voluntary, the government has indicated it will consider alternative measures if businesses fail to comply within 18 months.</p>

He suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time expense that caused an earnings miss, while overlooking the fundamental strengths of the business, including its ability to attract shoppers and manage tariff impacts.
