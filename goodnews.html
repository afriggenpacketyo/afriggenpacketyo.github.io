        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles is urging House committees to investigate Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell, accusing him of obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This follows criticism from the Trump administration, which claims O'Connell supports "pro-illegal policies." O'Connell signed an executive order to track interactions with federal immigration authorities after ICE agents arrested nearly 200 people in Nashville. Ogles argues that the executive order is being used as a political weapon against law enforcement. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan is already holding a hearing on threats to ICE operations.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz described the arduous four-year, $25 million journey to list his crypto firm, Galaxy Digital, on the Nasdaq, calling the process "unfair, infuriating, and un-American." He said the process, which should have taken 45 to 90 days, stretched to 1,320 days and required nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal strengthened the company, which funded itself primarily through investment gains and trading. He expects auditing fees to decrease by up to 40% now that Galaxy is listed.</p>

          <p>Producing a vehicle entirely from U.S.-sourced parts is currently not feasible due to the complexities of the global automotive supply chain and the high costs involved. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase U.S. investments, experts say sourcing all parts domestically would significantly raise vehicle prices, potentially pricing consumers out of the market. Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that 15% to 20% of commoditized parts are difficult to source in the U.S., including semiconductors and labor-intensive wiring harnesses. Analysts estimate that material costs alone would add thousands of dollars to a vehicle's price. Experts estimate that the average cost increase for an American-assembled U.S. full-size pickup would jump at least $7,000 to source as many components as currently possible from the U.S. and Canada.</p>
