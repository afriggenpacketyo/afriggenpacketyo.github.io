          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from immigration detention, stating her detention could chill free speech. Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student, was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa based on an essay critical of Israel. The judge emphasized the lack of evidence linking her to any threat and criticized the government's reliance on the op-ed as justification. This New York Times article provides detailed background on the case, including Ozturk's experiences in detention and the legal arguments presented.</p>
