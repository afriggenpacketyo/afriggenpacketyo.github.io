          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index-tracking ETFs is facing scrutiny from some financial experts. They argue that the index has become imbalanced, with technology stocks accounting for a record high of over 35%, reducing diversification for investors. As a result, traders are reportedly showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, such as those in the Russell 2000 index, which recently hit an all-time high. This shift comes as major tech companies are set to report their latest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, native plants are blooming, and wildlife is returning to the revitalized waterway. The restoration inspired an Indigenous youth program, "Paddle Tribal Waters," where teenagers completed the first full kayak descent of the river in more than 100 years. This successful project is now serving as a model for river restoration movements worldwide.</p>

Completed in 1801, it temporarily housed President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison after the White House was burned in 1814, and it was where the treaty ending the War of 1812 was signed. The house is also known for its reported paranormal activity, with tales of unexplained events and ghostly presences, including a story involving a young Jackie Bouvier.

          <p>In a personal essay, a mother recounts her experience of gaining 100 pounds during pregnancy and the subsequent obsession with losing the weight. She describes how her fixation on aggressive exercise and restrictive dieting distracted her from fully enjoying the precious moments with her newborn son. Looking back, she expresses regret for not embracing her post-birth body and focusing instead on being present with her child. The author advises that she should have celebrated her body for its ability to create life rather than punishing it to meet societal expectations.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a comfortable 26-6 victory over England in the first Rugby League Ashes match in 22 years at Wembley. The Kangaroos demonstrated superior quality, particularly in the second half, after a hard-fought opening. Full-back Reece Walsh was the standout player, scoring the opening try and adding another later in the game. Despite a consolation try from England's Daryl Clark, Australia's dominant performance suggests they remain the team to beat in the series, which continues next week in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. While votes were still being counted, Humphreys acknowledged Connolly's lead and congratulated her on the victory. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker, ran with the backing of several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. The presidency in Ireland is a largely ceremonial role, and Connolly will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms.</p>

This hands-on approach underscores Xi's centralized authority and personal investment in the nation's long-term strategic direction.

Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is made from a transparent hydrogel material, making it difficult to detect, and operates with low power consumption and near-silent movement. Its lifelike design makes it suitable for observing fragile marine ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, and conducting covert monitoring operations. The compact device measures 120mm in diameter and weighs only 56 grams.</p>

The Amazon founder had originally purchased the property overlooking Lake Washington in 2019 for $37.5 million, realizing a significant profit from the sale. This move coincides with Bezos reducing his ownership stake in Amazon to below 10%, having sold over 100 million shares in the past year.

Liautaud, who grew his company from a single shop into a multi-billion dollar brand, believes that aspiring business owners must be prepared to be "a grinder" and work 24/7. This philosophy echoes the work habits of other highly successful entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Elon Musk in their early careers.</p>
