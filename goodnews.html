          <p>Emma Raducanu and Cameron Norrie secured first-round victories at the Italian Open, while Katie Boulter was defeated. Raducanu overcame a tough challenge in a three-set match, demonstrating resilience after a month-long break from competitive tennis. Norrie channeled his anger from a previous defeat into a dominant performance, winning in straight sets. Boulter, however, struggled to replicate her recent form and lost her match despite Pavlyuchenkova's recent losing streak. Raducanu expressed that she used the thought of losing the match to fuel her motivation going into the deciding set, highlighting her mental fortitude.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the next US Surgeon General. Dr. Means, who replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is a proponent of Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda. She is known for advocating for addressing the root causes of illness and co-founded Levels, a health app connected to glucose monitors. Dr. Means has gained prominence for her views on the food and drug industry, aligning with Kennedy's claims about unhealthy food and lifestyle choices impacting Americans' health. She co-authored "Good Energy" after her mother's death, criticizing the focus on pills over addressing root causes.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje is anticipated to be named captain of the British and Irish Lions for their upcoming tour of Australia. The 30-year-old would be the first Englishman to hold the title since 2001, leading a squad of approximately 40 players. Itoje's leadership credentials have been bolstered by his captaincy of England during the 2025 Six Nations, where he led the team to a second-place finish. With Ireland's captain Caelan Doris undergoing shoulder surgery, Itoje has emerged as the leading candidate for the role, endorsed by former Lions such as Matt Dawson.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have initiated a public inquiry into the live music industry's business practices, focusing on issues affecting consumers. This inquiry follows an executive order from President Trump aimed at combating ticket scalpers. The DOJ and FTC are seeking public input on unfair and anti-competitive conduct in the live concert and entertainment sector. This announcement comes almost a year after the DOJ and 40 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, alleging monopolistic practices and abuse of its merger with Ticketmaster, with the goal of breaking up the company.</p>

While AppLovin anticipates lower sales for the second quarter, the first-quarter net income rose substantially compared to the same period last year.

          <p>Nvidia shares increased following the Trump administration's plan to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have restricted the export of advanced AI chips to certain countries. The Department of Commerce stated that the existing rule is overly complex and would hinder American innovation, with the intention of replacing it with a simpler rule to promote American AI dominance. Chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, have opposed the restrictions, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noting that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would be a significant loss.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate in the North Carolina Supreme Court race, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his challenge to the election results. Griffin's concession ends his six-month effort to overturn the election in the battleground state. The ruling by a Trump-appointed judge is a significant win for Democrats, ensuring Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the Republican-majority court. This outcome also improves the Democrats' chances of regaining the majority on the court in 2028.</p>
