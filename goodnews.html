          <p>President Donald Trump officially pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, had appealed to the Trump administration for pardons for her parents and spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention. The couple, famous for "Chrisley Knows Best," were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution for providing false information to banks and fabricating bank statements. The charges against the Chrisleys stem from activity that occurred as early as 2007, and prosecutors described their actions as a "fifteen-year fraud spree."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the emerging critique of his tariff policies, known as the "TACO trade," which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out." This term describes a pattern where Trump announces tariffs, markets decline, and then he eases them, causing markets to rebound. When asked about the term, Trump denied backing down and argued that his actions have helped the U.S. in trade negotiations, citing the European Union's willingness to meet after he threatened a 50% tariff. He emphasized that his approach is a negotiation tactic, not a sign of weakness.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% increase in data center sales. The company expects approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance was reduced due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry. Despite political tensions, Nvidia continues to experience strong growth due to high demand for its artificial intelligence chips, used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>

          <p>Consolidating credit card debt this June could be a smart move due to high credit card interest rates, the potential for declining rates on alternatives, and the impact of compounding interest (not investment advice). Credit card interest rates are likely to remain high, while rates on alternatives like home equity borrowing products could fall further (not investment advice). Consolidating with a HELOC or debt consolidation loan can save interest costs and allow for larger payments toward the principal (not investment advice). Speaking with a financial advisor or debt relief servicer can help build a personalized debt consolidation plan (not investment advice).</p>
