          <p>A new study found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound, and can find tumors smaller than those found by regular mammography. While MRI scans are slightly better at detecting tumors overall, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely available. The study suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography should become standard care for high-risk women with dense breasts, although it has not yet been approved by the FDA for breast cancer screening.</p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks surged Friday on a report that President Donald Trump will sign executive orders to speed the construction of reactors and secure key materials for the industry. Trump will invoke the Defense Production Act to declare a national emergency due to U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium, nuclear fuel processing and inputs for advance reactors, according to a draft summary viewed by Reuters. The president is also expected to direct federal agencies to permit and site new nuclear facilities, according to Reuters.</p>
