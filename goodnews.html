          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled Dominion Voting Systems' $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit regarding his unfounded claims of 2020 election rigging. The confidential agreement, filed in federal court, permanently dismisses the suit initiated in 2021. This settlement adds to Giuliani's legal and financial challenges, following previous settlements by Fox News and Newsmax over similar allegations. The case highlighted the significant impact of election conspiracy theories on public trust and individuals.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve received a one-game suspension and a fine from the WNBA for her conduct and comments following a playoff loss. The league cited her aggressive pursuit and verbal abuse of an official, delayed court exit, inappropriate fan comments, and critical remarks in a post-game press conference. This marks a rare playoff suspension for a WNBA coach. Reeve strongly criticized the officiating crew's competence for a semi-finals game, highlighting broader league concerns about officiating consistency.</p>

          <p>Europe has established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the USA heading into the Ryder Cup singles matches, requiring only 2.5 more points for retention. This historic lead comes despite "thuggish, moronic, and personal insults" from American galleries directed at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. The European team's exceptional performance has led to a significant American capitulation, with resale prices for Sunday tickets plummeting. Captain Luke Donald remains pragmatic, emphasizing the job isn't done, but acknowledging his team's strong fight.</p>

Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, discusses his evolving stances on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, asserting "the cases swung, not me." He expresses deep concern about the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, warning that democracy's survival is not guaranteed. Kennedy also recounts a poignant reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia before Scalia's death, emphasizing the importance of renewing friendships.</p>

          <h2>Expert Opinions Divided on Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated wellness trend. While some users report positive results, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin effectively. The body breaks down collagen into peptides, which may or may not preferentially target skin cells. Experts generally agree that topical collagen creams are ineffective, and emphasize sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as far more impactful for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>
