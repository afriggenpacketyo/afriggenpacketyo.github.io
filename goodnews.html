          <p>India claimed a dramatic victory over England by just six runs in the final Test match at The Oval, drawing the series 2-2. England's pursuit of a record 374 runs fell short in a tense final day, despite a courageous effort from an injured Chris Woakes who came out to bat. The match, filled with fluctuating fortunes and high emotion, is being hailed as one of the greatest in Test cricket history. The thrilling conclusion capped off a hard-fought and often fractious series between the two top-ranked teams.</p>

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk approximately 96 million shares of restricted stock, valued at around $29 billion, based on the company's performance. This move comes just six months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, larger 2018 pay package, ruling it was improperly negotiated with a board that was not independent. To receive the shares, Musk must pay the exercise price of $23.34 per share, as stipulated in the original plan. The award reignites the debate over the scale of executive compensation at the electric vehicle company.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is launching a second independent campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska, this time challenging incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. Despite losing his first race, Osborn significantly narrowed the Republican margin of victory in a state Donald Trump won by 20 points, fueling his new bid. He is framing his campaign as a contest between the working class and the wealthy elite, hoping to appeal to voters across the political spectrum who are frustrated with the two-party system. His candidacy has prompted political analysts to re-evaluate the race from "Safe" to "Likely" Republican.</p>

As part of the initiative, corporate and individual buyers can receive significant subsidies, up to 250,000 yuan (US$34,700), on purchases from leading Chinese manufacturers like Unitree and UBTech. The event coincides with the opening of a new specialized store for robot sales and maintenance.

          <p>A recent survey of American children aged 8 to 12 reveals a strong preference for unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socialization or adult-organized activities. However, the same survey shows that most children are not allowed significant freedom, with many parents fearing for their safety even in their own neighborhoods. The article argues that this lack of real-world independence is a key driver of the "phone-based childhood," as kids turn to screens for the unsupervised social interaction they crave. It suggests that granting children more freedom to play independently is a crucial step in reducing screen time.</p>

          <h2>Global Fur Production Plummets Over 85% in a Decade Amid Ethical and Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global production of animal fur has experienced a dramatic collapse, falling from over 140 million animals farmed in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This sharp decline is attributed to a combination of successful animal welfare campaigns, shifting consumer perceptions, and legislative action. Major fashion houses have dropped fur from their collections, and numerous countries, particularly in Europe, have banned fur farming. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend, as mink farms became hotspots for the virus, further cementing fur's shift from a luxury status symbol to an ethical misstep.</p>

          <p>CK Asset Holdings has issued a formal statement to deny widespread social media rumors that the family of billionaire Li Ka-shing is selling its historic residence at 79 Deep Water Bay Road in Hong Kong. The company, on behalf of chairman Victor Li, described the speculation as "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." In the statement, Li urged the public not to trust or spread such rumors, linking them to a rise in online scams. The denial comes at a time when other wealthy Hong Kong families have been forced to sell assets due to economic pressures.</p>

          <p>China's central bank is accelerating its strategy to internationalize the yuan, seizing on what it perceives as growing uncertainty surrounding the stability of the U.S. dollar. The People's Bank of China announced plans to expand the yuan's use in global trade and finance, enhance offshore markets, and improve its Cross-border Interbank Payment System. This renewed focus marks the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been featured as a dedicated section in the bank's midyear policy readout. The move signals Beijing's ambition to establish its currency as a more significant player in the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK Home Office minister has stated that migrants arriving on small boats will generally be allowed to keep their mobile phones. This clarification comes after the government introduced a bill aimed at giving authorities more power to seize devices from those suspected of being people-smugglers. The minister, Dame Angela Eagle, explained the goal is to target facilitators of illegal crossings, not to confiscate every phone from every arrival. The policy seeks to reverse a High Court ruling that found a previous blanket seizure policy was unlawful.</p>

          <p>A pit bull is being hailed as a hero in Pittsburgh after it crossed a busy street to get help for its two owners, who had become unresponsive in a secluded tent encampment. A local resident, Gary Thynes, was approached by the barking dog and followed it to the scene, where he found the man and woman and called 911. The pair were transported to the hospital for treatment. Thynes, who is now fostering the dog while its owners recover, praised the animal's persistence and love for its humans, stating it "definitely saved some lives."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicates a decline in major depression and suicidal thoughts among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12 to 17 fell from nearly 13% to 10%, with suicide attempts also decreasing. Experts find the trend promising, potentially linking it to increased openness among teens about mental health struggles and better access to specialized treatment. However, the report also notes that millions of teens still experience suicidal thoughts, and access to care remains a significant challenge.</p>
