          <p>The governments of Ireland, Norway, and Spain have officially recognized the state of Palestine, a move that Ireland's prime minister hopes other European nations will soon emulate. The decision in Ireland, which comes over four decades after the country first called for a Palestinian state, is rooted in a historical sense of solidarity with colonized peoples. Israel has condemned the decision and recalled its ambassador from Dublin. Palestinian diplomats, however, view the recognition as significant progress toward self-determination and the establishment of a physical state.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is creating a massive demand for electricity, positioning GE Vernova as a key supplier of essential gas-fired turbines for new data centers. This surge has led to a significant increase in orders and a financial windfall for the company, with its stock price doubling this year. However, the industry faces challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the demand, with wait times for new turbines extending for years. This situation reflects a broader energy bottleneck in the AI revolution as tech giants race to secure power for their infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

The post included photos from the home birth and a graphic image of the placenta, which was also shown being processed into pills. While many celebrities and fans offered congratulations and praised the post for normalizing childbirth, others were taken aback by the explicit nature of the photos. The practice of consuming the placenta, known as placentophagy, is claimed by some to have health benefits, though scientific evidence is lacking.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle surged by 20% after former President Donald Trump posted on social media praising the company's new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign, with the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had faced some criticism for being a double entendre, but Trump's endorsement appeared to trigger a rally in the company's stock. The event highlights the complex and often unpredictable influence of cultural and political discourse on market behavior. The surge provided a boost for the company, which has been struggling with declining sales this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a bacterium, Vibrio pectenicida, as the cause of a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion starfish along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The epidemic, which causes the animals to develop lesions and disintegrate, has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star. The discovery, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, solves a long-standing mystery and may help in conservation efforts. The loss of these predators has had cascading effects, leading to an explosion in sea urchin populations and the destruction of vital kelp forests.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 60% Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Current Impact on Borrowers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 12:57:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An important but often misunderstood regulation, the 60% reverse mortgage rule, limits how much money homeowners can withdraw during the first year of a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). This FHA rule caps the initial withdrawal at 60% of the total available proceeds, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off existing mandatory obligations. While designed to prevent borrowers from depleting their home equity too quickly, this limitation can pose challenges for seniors needing immediate access to a larger lump sum. The regulation encourages long-term financial stability but requires careful planning from borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is making his first foray into the horror genre with the new film "Weapons," in which he plays a father searching for his vanished child. Brolin stated he was drawn to the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to explore themes of masculinity and vulnerability. Known for major roles in blockbusters like "Avengers" and "Dune," he explained that he typically avoided horror projects while raising his own children. He said the genre shaped his childhood, and he was intrigued by the idea of tackling something he was not sure he could do.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. for six months, delaying measures that were set to begin this week. This decision follows a political agreement reached last month between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump. The pause is intended to provide time to finalize the details of the trade deal and restore stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The deal itself includes a 15% U.S. tariff on most European goods, including automobiles.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Eating Minimally Processed Meals Doubles Weight Loss Compared to Healthy Ultra-Processed Foods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultra-processed foods, even when the latter were designed to be healthy. Participants in the UK-based study ate fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat over eight weeks when consuming minimally processed foods. Surprisingly, those on the "healthy" ultra-processed diet also lost a small amount of weight by eating fewer calories than they typically would. The research suggests that the nature of food processing itself plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

          <h2>Vermont Engineer Restores and Installs Pay Phones for Free Public Use</h2>

          <p>To combat poor cell reception in rural Vermont, electrical engineer Patrick Schlott is restoring old pay phones and installing them for free public use. He modifies the phones to make free calls to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada using an internet connection, and he personally covers the minimal operating costs. Since installing the first phone last year, hundreds of calls have been made, proving useful for stranded drivers and for children needing to contact their parents. With Vermont set to ban cell phones in schools, Schlott anticipates a growing need for these reliable, old-fashioned communication tools.</p>
