          <p>An expert in college admissions suggests that prospective students, especially international applicants, might find an advantage in applying to Harvard University during the current political challenges. With the Trump administration's restrictions on international student enrollment, some applicants may turn to other schools, potentially reducing competition for those who remain steadfast in their goal of attending Harvard. Despite the ongoing strife, Harvard's brand remains strong, and the school is likely to maintain its appeal to top students worldwide. This presents a unique opportunity for determined applicants to stand out.</p>

Federal grants are awarded for specific purposes, such as scientific research, which trade schools are typically not equipped to conduct. Redirecting funds would require evidence that Harvard's grants were improperly awarded, which has not been alleged. While trade schools could benefit from additional government support, it is unlikely to come from research grants.</p>
