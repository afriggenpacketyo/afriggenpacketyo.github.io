          <p>In Uganda, an affordable alternative to dirt floors is providing a significant boost to human health, as Simon Tigawalana transitioned from dirt floors to clay-based earthen floors in his home. EarthEnable, a company promoting housing upgrades across Africa, has been installing these floors in Uganda since 2017, reducing dust and jigger infestations. The clay floors cost around $65, making them 70% cheaper than concrete, and can be paid in installments. The company employs local masons and touts the floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete.</p>
