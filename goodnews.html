          <p>Former President Barack Obama advised Democratic donors to "toughen up" and support candidates with a genuine chance of winning, rather than seeking a "messiah." Speaking at a fundraiser, he emphasized the need for pragmatism and courage, urging the party to back common-sense policies and electable figures in upcoming races. Obama stressed that ideological purity is less important than delivering tangible results for constituents, such as addressing housing shortages by reforming restrictive zoning laws. He called for a more aggressive and unified approach to regain political momentum following recent electoral setbacks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department successfully recovered an assault rifle and five fully loaded magazines that were misplaced after likely falling from a patrol car. The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken. A resident in the Lennox area found the hard-shelled gun case, initially mistaking it for a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the local sheriff's station. Officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's honesty and responsible actions, which prevented the high-powered weapon from remaining on the streets.</p>

          <h2>New Superalloy Cooling Technique Could Advance China's Jet Engine Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could resolve long-standing issues in the country's aircraft engine production. The method involves rapidly cooling forged superalloy turbine discs, a critical component that must withstand extreme heat and pressure. Improving the quality and durability of these discs is essential for enhancing engine power, efficiency, and lifespan. This technological advancement is particularly crucial as China works to develop advanced engines for its next-generation fighter jets, an area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally requested the Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. Maxwell's legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein should have protected her from prosecution nationwide. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was limited to the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary not explicitly covered by the deal. An attorney for Epstein's victims stated Maxwell should remain imprisoned for her "horrific crimes," reinforcing the legal consensus from lower courts.</p>

The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023.

While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the old machines use original chemical processing, producing unique black-and-white photo strips after a brief wait. The museum aims to capture the "analog magic" that has become popular with a younger, digital-native audience seeking tangible and unique visual experiences.</p>
