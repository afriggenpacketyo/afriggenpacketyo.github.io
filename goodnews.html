          <p>Mattel is partnering with OpenAI to develop generative AI-powered toys and games, aiming to innovate and stay ahead in the evolving tech landscape. The collaboration seeks to combine Mattel's popular brands, like Barbie and Hot Wheels, with OpenAI's AI capabilities to create new products and experiences. Mattel emphasizes that the AI will be used safely and securely in age-appropriate play experiences, and the company plans to use OpenAI's business tools to improve product development. Mattel has been working to leverage its intellectual property into movies, television, and mobile games in the face of flagging toy sales, and the company has paused its full-year guidance for 2025 citing tariff-driven uncertainty.</p>

Scale AI, founded in 2016, has become a prominent player in the AI industry, assisting major tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft in preparing data for training AI models.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress that lawmakers would be involved in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance, following reports that the Pentagon was reviewing the security pact between Australia, Britain, and the US. The Aukus alliance, launched in 2021, is widely viewed as a countermeasure to China‚Äôs regional influence. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated China's opposition to actions that amplify the risk of nuclear proliferation and exacerbate an arms race. The review's short timeframe was questioned, considering the years it took to develop the pact, but Hegseth affirmed Congress's involvement in the process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has seemingly reversed his stance on Chinese students studying in the United States, expressing support for them and pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This contrasts with previous administration initiatives aimed at limiting or blocking international students due to national security concerns. Trump stated that having Chinese nationals study in the US is beneficial for both the schools and the country, and he supports allowing them to work for American companies after completing their studies. He noted that if they are not allowed to stay, they would return to their countries and start businesses there.</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering revisions to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," focusing on key provisions like SNAP, SALT, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Changes are expected to lessen the burden on states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal and lower the cap on state and local tax deductions. Senator Rand Paul is advocating for lowering the amount of money allocated for border security, while Medicaid changes remain uncertain. The goal is to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path, but some changes could face challenges in the House.</p>
