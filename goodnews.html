          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, the Mannix family and other local ranchers are countering the threats of big agriculture and climate change through innovative practices. They have formed the Old Salt Co-op, a collective that focuses on regenerative ranching, which involves rotating livestock to allow land to rest and recover, improving soil health and grass production. By processing a significant portion of their cattle locally and selling directly to consumers via their own restaurants and butcher shop, they aim to create a more resilient and secure local food system. This model supports local producers and promotes long-term ecological and economic sustainability.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a major federation of UK trade unions, is publicly calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to explore implementing various wealth taxes in the upcoming budget. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak suggested options such as taxes on online gaming, windfall profits of banks, and equalizing capital gains tax with income tax. The proposal aims to generate revenue for public services by asking financial institutions and the wealthiest to contribute more, citing record bank profits. The Treasury responded by stating that the government's primary focus remains on growing the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18th-century painting by Italian artist Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis 80 years ago, has been successfully recovered in Argentina. The artwork, titled "Portrait of a Lady," was discovered after it was spotted in a photograph on an real estate website, hanging in a home belonging to the daughter of a high-ranking Nazi fugitive. The painting was part of the collection of Amsterdam art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, whose family has been working to reclaim his stolen art. The recovered piece is reported to be in good condition and has been valued at approximately $50,000.</p>

The comprehensive project involved repairing the clock mechanism, restoring the original Victorian color scheme on the clock faces, and making accessibility improvements, including a new lift. The nomination recognizes the extensive conservation and craftsmanship involved in the most significant renovation of the 160-year-old landmark to date. The tower is one of six projects competing for the esteemed prize.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee successfully intervened in a lawsuit to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being removed from the rolls. The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver’s license or partial social security number. Following negotiations, a consent agreement was reached that allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place. This outcome is being hailed as a significant victory for voting rights advocates in the state.</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried by two major streaming platforms, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, significantly expanding its audience reach. The move comes after C-SPAN faced financial deficits due to the decline of traditional cable and satellite subscriptions, which prompted the U.S. Senate to urge streaming services to add the network. The three C-SPAN channels will be added to YouTube TV's base package this fall. These deals are a crucial step for the privately funded, nonpartisan network to adapt to the changing media landscape and continue its mission of providing unfiltered coverage of government proceedings.</p>

          <p>The publisher of "Nobody's Girl," a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, has confirmed that a final version has been agreed upon with her family. Relatives had previously objected to the book's release, concerned it presented an outdated and overly positive view of her marriage, which had ended before her death by suicide in April. The publisher, Knopf, worked with Giuffre's family to add a foreword that contextualizes the narrative and reflects the changes in her life after the manuscript was completed. The book is now scheduled for publication, with all parties agreeing on the importance of her voice being heard.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova achieved a significant victory at the US Open, defeating top-ranked Iga Swiatek in the quarterfinals with a score of 6-4, 6-3.

Playing with fearless aggression on her home soil, Anisimova controlled the match with powerful groundstrokes to reach her first-ever US Open semifinal. The victory marks a major career milestone for the 24-year-old, who took a mental health break from the sport in 2023.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration, overturning its decision to revoke approximately $2 billion in research funding from Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs determined that the administration violated the university's First Amendment free speech rights when it froze the funding in April over accusations of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies. The judge stated that while Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, the government's actions appeared to be a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling blocks the administration from withholding any further federal funding from the institution.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has settled a lawsuit filed five years ago by parents who alleged the district failed to provide adequate education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement will provide tutoring and other academic support to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The lawsuit, filed at the height of campus closures, claimed that Black and Latino students were disproportionately harmed by the lack of live instruction and technology access. The settlement mandates at least 45 hours of high-dosage tutoring per year for eligible students.</p>

          <p>In a significant ruling for the tech industry, a federal judge has decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser as a remedy in its antitrust case. While Judge Amit Mehta had previously deemed Google a "monopolist" in online search, he spared the company from the most severe potential penalty, calling a divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." The decision, which caused parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%, does impose other limits, such as requiring Google to share some search data with rivals to foster competition.
