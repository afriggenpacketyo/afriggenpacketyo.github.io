          <p>Jesse Armstrong, creator of the hit show *Succession*, is back with a new film, *Mountainhead*, a satire about tech billionaires facing social unrest. Armstrong explains that his interest lies in exploring power dynamics rather than just wealth, reflecting themes similar to those in *Succession*. He emphasized the rapid production of the film to capture the anxieties surrounding technology and AI, aiming for a sense of immediacy. Armstrong also mentioned that directing the film quickly helped alleviate his anxieties about directing for the first time.</p>

Musk thanked President Trump for the opportunity to serve and expressed confidence in the future of the DOGE mission. This transition comes as the agency moves into a new phase during Trump's second term. Musk will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president and could potentially attend White House meetings.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a decline despite the company exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, boosted by artificial intelligence. While the company's results point to a stable demand environment, some analysts noted a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter. Salesforce's recent announcement of its intent to acquire Informatica for $8 billion may also be influencing investor sentiment. This deal is expected to bolster the company's AI offerings.</p>
