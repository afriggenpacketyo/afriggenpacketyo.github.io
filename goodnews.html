          <h2>Boeing to Resume China Deliveries and Increase Max Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 11:23:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month, ending a pause caused by trade tensions. Ortberg dismissed concerns about the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, noting that Boeing already pays tariffs on imported components for its Dreamliner planes but can recoup much of it upon export. The company, a major U.S. exporter, is also planning to increase production of its 737 Max aircraft. This resumption of deliveries is a positive sign for Boeing's financial outlook and its relationship with China, a key market for the company.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that home equity loan and HELOC rates are unlikely to drop in June, remaining stable with a risk of increases due to economic uncertainty and potential inflationary effects from tariffs. While the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation, its plans to lower rates may be delayed. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, while HELOCs have variable rates that adjust monthly based on the prime rate. Despite higher interest rates, these borrowing options can still be more competitive than credit cards or personal loans, but homeowners should be comfortable with the total borrowing amount and monthly payments.

          <p>Astronomers searching for the elusive "Planet Nine" have discovered a new dwarf planet, named 2017 OF201, in the outer reaches of the solar system. The object, roughly 430 miles across, is three times smaller than Pluto and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years to complete. This discovery could challenge the Planet Nine theory, as the new dwarf planet's orbit does not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. Researchers are requesting time to use the James Webb, Hubble, and ALMA telescopes to study the dwarf planet further, which could shed light on the mysteries of the outer solar system.</p>

Todd Chrisley was serving a 12-year sentence, while Julie Chrisley was serving a 7-year sentence. The Chrisleys gained fame on the show "Chrisley Knows Best," which depicted their wealthy lifestyle. The couple had sought a presidential pardon by alleging serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid and false testimony.

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer 19th-century photographs of an enslaved man and his daughter to the International African American Museum in South Carolina, settling a lawsuit with a descendant. Tamara Lanier, the great-great-great granddaughter of Renty Taylor and Delia Taylor, sued Harvard in 2019 over the "wrongful seizure, possession, and expropriation" of the images. The daguerreotypes, taken in 1850, were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz to promote white supremacist theories. The settlement includes a confidential monetary component and marks a victory for reparations.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares declined despite the company exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, driven by artificial intelligence tailwinds. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33 and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts attributed the stock's decline to a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss.

The ruling supports the developers of a proposed 88-mile railroad in Utah, which could carry crude oil to refineries along the Gulf Coast.
