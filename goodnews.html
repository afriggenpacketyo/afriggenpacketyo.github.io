          <p>The Trump administration's plan to house up to 30,000 migrants at Guant√°namo Bay has been scaled back, with tents erected for the purpose being dismantled after only three months. The operation never expanded beyond housing 32 migrants in pre-existing buildings. The decision to dismantle the tents suggests a shift away from housing tens of thousands of migrants at the base, despite the president's initial vision. The article uses satellite images to show the buildup and subsequent dismantling of the tent infrastructure, highlighting the discrepancy between the initial plan and the reality of the operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the evolving attitudes of Americans towards Israel, noting a decline in support and a rise in sympathy for Palestinians. This shift is attributed to events such as the Hamas attacks and Israel's military response in Gaza, which have sparked protests and political divisions in the United States. While the US has historically been a strong ally of Israel, recent polls suggest that this support is waning, particularly among Democrats and younger voters. The article explores the historical context of the US-Israel relationship and considers the potential implications of these changing sentiments on future policy decisions.</p>

Despite the grim realities, Attenborough remains optimistic, emphasizing the ocean's remarkable capacity to recover quickly if given the chance, citing the recovery of whale populations as a prime example.</p>

          <p>Hollywood executives are grappling with President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the US, a move aimed at revitalizing the American film industry. The proposal has sparked confusion and dread, with industry leaders unsure how such tariffs would be implemented and whether they would apply to US-based companies shooting abroad. While some applaud the intent to protect American jobs, many fear the tariffs would increase costs and hasten the industry's decline. Congressional leaders suggest that tax incentives would be a better approach to boost US film production.</p>

          <p>President Trump has falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, in an effort to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, the national average for gasoline prices is significantly higher than Trump's claim, with U.S. drivers paying over $3 per gallon. While gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this figure does not reflect the retail prices consumers pay at the pump.
