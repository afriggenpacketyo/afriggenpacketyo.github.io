          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that if the U.S. continues AI semiconductor restrictions on China, Huawei will capitalize on its position in the Chinese market. While acknowledging Nvidia's technology is ahead, Huang cautioned that restricting U.S. participation could lead to Huawei dominating China's AI development. He emphasized the importance of global AI developers using American technology and cautioned against unintended consequences of near-term actions on long-term goals. The CEO also mentioned informing the Trump administration about Nvidia's tech and industry dynamics, expressing trust in Trump's plan. Optimism is moderate given the potential shifts in global tech dominance.</p>

          <p>Sly Stone, who died at 82, is remembered as a transcender and synthesizer of situations, blending Black and white, R&B and rock, politics and carnival. During his prime from 1968 to 1971, he harmonized energies tearing the country apart, giving America a vision of racial and emotional integration. Songs like "Stand!" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" showcased his ability to balance celebration with darker lyrical themes. Despite decades of obscurity, Stone's music remains relevant, offering a reminder of the potential for unity amidst division.

          <p>This article discusses current CD interest rates, noting that leading accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate. As of June 12, 2025, the national average for a 1-year CD yield is 2.00% APY, while some banks offer rates as high as 4.41% APY for a 6-month CD. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks and short-term CDs. The inverted yield curve means short-term CDs currently have higher interest rates than longer terms. The outlook is moderately positive, with opportunities to lock in great rates with flexible terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump initially rescinded an invitation to Republican Sen. Rand Paul for the annual congressional picnic, citing Paul's opposition to the GOP-backed budget bill. Paul criticized the move as "incredibly petty," stating he was the only senator uninvited. However, Trump later reversed course, stating that Paul and his family are welcome to attend. Paul has been critical of the policy bill because it would raise the debt ceiling, accusing the White House of running a "paid influencer campaign" against him.
