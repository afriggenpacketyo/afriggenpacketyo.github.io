          <h2>India Becomes Top Smartphone Exporter to U.S., Surpassing China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 02:12:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, accounting for 44% of U.S. imports in the second quarter, a significant jump from 13% the previous year. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While Apple has increased production in India, it still relies on China's established infrastructure for its premium models. The trend reflects a broader move by global manufacturers to diversify supply chains, with Vietnam also exporting more smartphones to the U.S. than China in the same period.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the challenging journey of Indian seam bowler Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, Deep overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to temporarily abandon cricket to support his family. He later moved to Bengal, where his talent was recognized, leading to a successful domestic career, an IPL contract, and ultimately his Test debut for India. Deep's story is one of perseverance, highlighting his dedication to the sport despite immense personal and financial hardships.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 01:02:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is launching an ambitious initiative to build AI 'gigafactories' to bolster its competitive standing against the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence sector. These facilities are designed as comprehensive ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models and applications. The EU has committed an initial 20 billion euros for the gigafactories and has already received significant interest from member states. While the plan aims to enhance Europe's technological sovereignty, it faces challenges such as high energy costs and the need for substantial private investment to succeed.</p>

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their work of rescuing migrants in the English Channel, stating they make no apologies for saving lives at sea. Facing accusations of acting as a 'taxi service,' the crew emphasizes that their mission is purely humanitarian and apolitical, responding to any distress call from the Coastguard. The charity released harrowing images of a recent rescue to show the dangerous reality of the crossings, where they saved 19 people from a capsized dinghy. Crew members assert that their actions are driven by compassion for people in distress.</p>

          <p>A review of British newspaper front pages shows a focus on U.S. President Donald Trump's visit with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the England women's football team's Euro 2025 win.

The Guardian and Daily Mirror highlighted Trump's acknowledgement of 'real starvation' in Gaza. Meanwhile, The Sun celebrated the victorious football team as 'The Lion Ladies,' with other papers calling for the players and manager to receive national honors for their historic achievement.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist 'decoupling.' In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, urging Seoul to deepen pragmatic cooperation with Beijing. The discussion comes as Beijing seeks to improve ties with South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is viewed as more open to China than his predecessor. The ministers also agreed to collaborate to ensure the success of the upcoming APEC summit in Gyeongju.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The policy will provide families with 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China faces a shrinking and rapidly aging population, despite abolishing its one-child policy nearly a decade ago. The high cost of raising children is considered a major deterrent for many couples, and this nationwide handout aims to alleviate some of that financial pressure.</p>

          <p>Germany is partnering with Jordan to organize an airlift to deliver humanitarian aid directly into the besieged Gaza Strip, where concerns about widespread starvation are growing. The announcement came as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz met with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Berlin to discuss regional developments. This move reflects increasing international pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the territory. A recent survey also shows that nearly three-quarters of Germans believe their government should apply more pressure on Israel to address the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided invaluable, direct access to the American leader, though it came with political risks. The meeting, which included a freewheeling, hour-long press Q&A, saw the two leaders discuss topics ranging from Gaza to Scottish independence. For Starmer, the face time helps solidify a key international relationship, but it also requires careful navigation of Trump's unpredictable style. Downing Street views the access as crucial and is pleased with what it sees as an alignment of views on the urgent need for humanitarian aid in Gaza.</p>
