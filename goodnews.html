          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This government-coordinated operation, involving multiple departments, responds to calls from MPs to address the decimated healthcare system in the conflict zone. The World Health Organization will manage the travel logistics after children are selected based on need by local health officials. Given the difficulty of returning to Gaza, some children and their families may enter the asylum system after receiving care through the NHS.</p>

          <p>A group of advocates in Wisconsin is forming a nonprofit lake association to protect and improve Little Lake Butte des Morts, which spans five municipalities including Neenah and Appleton. The initiative aims to provide a unified voice for implementing projects and securing funding to address key environmental concerns. A recent survey identified algae blooms, excessive aquatic plant growth, and poor water quality as the top issues for local residents and property owners. The formation of the association builds on momentum from a recent aquatic plant management plan and aims to enhance public access and streamline conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously known as the last country without a national soccer team, has made its historic international debut in a match held in Springdale, Arkansas. The game was played in Arkansas due to its large Marshallese population, which gave the new team a passionate home crowd. Despite a 4-0 loss to the U.S. Virgin Islands, the event was celebrated as a major milestone, with fans cheering enthusiastically to finally see their nation represented on the global football stage. The moment was described as a significant and proud statement for the tiny island nation.</p>

          <p>A fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River in Minnesota has likely solved the nearly 60-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. The fisherman discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick, which authorities recovered and identified through its VIN as belonging to Benn, who was reported missing in 1967. Human remains found inside the vehicle are believed to be his, pending confirmation from a medical examiner. The discovery is expected to finally bring closure to Benn's family after decades of uncertainty surrounding his disappearance from the nearby community of St. Cloud.</p>

          <p>Despite growing social media calls for Los Angeles to withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics due to local issues like wildfires and budget deficits, the prospect is almost impossible. The host city contract signed with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not provide an exit clause for the city and would expose L.A. to billions of dollars in potential lawsuits and damages if breached. Unlike Denver in 1976, which rejected the Games over funding, the modern Olympic contract is iron-clad, and the scale of the event makes relocation unfeasible. Preparations are already well underway, with L.A. considered better prepared than most host cities due to its existing venues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of short-term rental listings in Los Angeles has decreased over the past year, with some hosts removing their properties from platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. This decline is attributed to several factors, including stricter city ordinances, the threat of increased fines for violations, and a shift towards more stable mid-term rentals (stays over 30 days). While the city's Home-Sharing Ordinance was intended to curb the conversion of housing stock into tourist rentals, many hosts have found the complex and evolving rules too burdensome. The trend reflects a cooling of the once-booming short-term rental market in the region.</p>

          <p>Tetsuya Nakao, the 62-year-old chef behind the acclaimed Studio City sushi restaurant Asanebo, has become a viral sensation on Instagram and TikTok.

The videos, which often end with his catchphrase "Asanebo style," feature extravagant dishes not served at the restaurant, like a Wagyu and caviar "pizza."
