          <p>Camp Homeward Bound, a nonprofit sleepaway camp operating for 41 years, offers a vital summer sanctuary for New York City children from homeless and domestic violence shelters. Many campers, like 17-year-old Cici Johnson who first attended at age 8 and is now a counselor, find a temporary home and a sense of belonging at the camp. Director Beverly McEntarfer emphasizes the camp's crucial role in character building and restoring childhoods often lost to difficult circumstances, noting the positive impact on confidence. Despite returning to challenging home lives, the camp instills lasting self-belief and a hopeful outlook for the future of these vulnerable youths.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV has issued a warning that channels including Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News, and Fox Sports could be removed from its streaming platform if a new distribution agreement with Fox Corporation is not finalized by Wednesday. YouTube asserts that Fox is demanding "far higher" payments compared to other content partners, emphasizing its commitment to a fair deal that avoids passing additional costs to subscribers. Fox, however, counters that Google is leveraging its market influence by proposing "out of step" terms. This potential blackout underscores the increasing contract disputes between content providers and streaming platforms as more consumers abandon traditional cable television services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has offloaded a record-setting 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana, totaling $473 million in value, at Port Everglades, Florida, representing the largest cocaine seizure in the agency's history. These substantial quantities of illegal narcotics were intercepted during 19 separate operations across the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, effectively preventing an estimated 23 million potentially lethal doses of cocaine from reaching American communities. Rear Admiral Adam Chamie praised the crews' arduous and hazardous efforts, stressing the critical role of maritime interdictions in disrupting drug supply chains. This achievement highlights the continuous, collaborative fight against international drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>A dramatic 3-2 victory for Liverpool against Newcastle United, clinched by 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha's historic goal in the 110th minute, has ignited an intense new Premier League rivalry. The high-octane match was heavily influenced by escalating tensions, primarily Liverpool's controversial pursuit of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and their prior acquisition of another Newcastle transfer target, Hugo Ekitike. Despite playing with 10 men and valiantly recovering from a two-goal deficit, Newcastle's spirited effort underscored the deep-seated animosity between the clubs. This sensational encounter, marked by emotional fury and late twists, firmly establishes a compelling and long-running feud in English football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and other Southern California airports implemented a ground stop due to the threat of thunderstorms, leading to grounded departures from various airports in neighboring states like Phoenix and Denver. This precautionary measure, enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration and National Weather Service, was prompted by a significant surge of monsoonal moisture across the Western U.S., which has recently caused dangerous dry lightning, major dust storms, and uncharacteristic summer rainfall. Although ground stops at Long Beach and John Wayne airports were later lifted, the event underscored the disruptive potential of these unusual weather patterns. Forecasters had predicted a 30% probability of thunderstorms near Palmdale, impacting flight routes in the region.</p>

          <p>British number one Cameron Norrie has progressed to the second round of the US Open after his American opponent, Sebastian Korda, was forced to retire due to injury. Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had recently returned to tour after a three-month lay-off from a shin stress fracture, called a medical timeout for an abdominal issue and could not continue. Norrie admitted to feeling "very nervous" about being the first player on court at 11 AM local time, but his advancement maintains his consistent positive form in Grand Slam tournaments. He is now set to face Argentina's Francisco Comesana in the next stage.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of conspiring to suppress competition within the burgeoning artificial intelligence market. The complaint, filed by Musk's entities xAI and X Corp., alleges that Apple unfairly prioritizes OpenAI and ChatGPT in its app store rankings, viewing AI as an "existential threat" to its lucrative iPhone franchise. Furthermore, Musk characterizes OpenAI as driven by profit and a potential danger to public safety, mirroring claims from a prior lawsuit he filed. OpenAI has dismissed this latest filing as consistent with Musk's "ongoing pattern of harassment," while Apple has yet to issue a public response to the allegations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advocated for investors to maintain their long-term positions in tech megacap stocks, even during market fluctuations, citing their proven track record of generating significant wealth for persistent holders. He observed Monday's market decline, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite experiencing a dip ahead of Nvidia's anticipated earnings report, yet reaffirmed his conviction in the future of generative artificial intelligence hardware, positioning Nvidia as a pivotal innovator. Cramer strongly cautioned against the difficulty of timing the market by selling and then repurchasing these substantial companies, suggesting they tend to rebound swiftly. He underscored that enduring market volatility with these investments typically yields the most favorable financial outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

The news marks a notable milestone for the brokerage service. Concurrently, Robinhood Markets, another digital brokerage, experienced a slight decline, as some investors had held expectations for its inclusion.

Returning after a 53-day absence due to bone bruising on his left arm, Draper attributed his vomiting to "nervous energy" and gut issues, not directly to his arm, which he had to "rein in" on his serve. This hard-fought win, his first since Wimbledon, showcased his resilient fighting spirit, even as his serve speeds were noticeably reduced. Draper expressed modest expectations for the tournament, prioritizing the recovery of his top form after a rapid preparation period.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly praised his "great relationship" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un during his initial White House meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. President Lee commended Trump for a recently finalized trade deal and requested his assistance in establishing enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula, even playfully suggesting a "Trump Tower" in North Korea. Trump expressed his readiness for future meetings with Kim, stating, "we can do big progress with North Korea." Earlier in the day, Trump had criticized South Korea's internal situation, citing "vicious raids on churches" and a "purge," but adopted a significantly softer tone during their official meeting, also affirming the finality of the trade agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's Notting Hill Carnival recorded "far fewer" incidents of serious violence compared to previous years, as reported by the Metropolitan Police. A total of 423 arrests were made over the two-day event, primarily for offenses like cannabis possession and carrying offensive weapons, with only two stabbings reported, neither resulting in serious injury. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward credited this significant reduction to proactive policing strategies, including the deployment of live facial recognition (LFR) technology, metal detectors, and extensive stop-and-search operations. While the use of LFR continues to draw criticism from civil liberty groups who label it a mass surveillance tool, police officials defend its accuracy and effectiveness in preventing serious crime.</p>

Executive Chairman McAndrew Rudisill underscored the company's dedication to expanding its ETH reserves and pursuing differentiated yield opportunities, specifically by staking recently acquired ETH to Electric Capital's proprietary protocol. This strategic move follows ETHZilla's recent transformation from a biotech entity into a crypto treasury firm, coinciding with Ethereum nearing a new all-time high. (not investment advice)</p>
