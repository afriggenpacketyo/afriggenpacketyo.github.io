          <p>The National Hockey League is preparing for its players to return to the Winter Olympics in 2026 for the first time in 12 years. Commissioner Gary Bettman acknowledged the decision involved balancing pros and cons but ultimately deemed it important for the league to be on a major global platform. The league's previous participation ended after the 2014 Sochi Games due to business and logistical challenges. A new agreement with the IOC, which improves commercial arrangements and player conditions, along with strong player desire to compete for their countries, prompted the return.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will automatically direct users identified as being under 18 to a version of ChatGPT with more stringent, age-appropriate content rules. This specialized version includes enhanced protections, such as blocking sexual content and mechanisms to contact law enforcement in cases of acute distress. The company is also introducing parental controls, allowing parents to link accounts, manage chat history, and set usage blackouts. These safeguards are being implemented following heightened scrutiny and concerns over the AI chatbot's potential negative impacts on teenagers.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality reported near Mount St. Helens are being caused by strong winds kicking up volcanic ash from the volcano's 1980 eruption, not new activity. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed this phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is occurring due to persistently dry weather and severe drought conditions in the area. Both the USGS and the National Weather Service have reassured the public that the volcano's alert level remains 'Normal.' However, they caution that the resuspended ash is hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to its lowest level since late 2022, providing potential relief for the housing market. This sharp decline is attributed to investor anticipation of a widely expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve. However, analysts caution that this trend may not last, as historical patterns show that long-term rates can paradoxically increase after the Fed officially announces a cut. The market remains watchful ahead of the central bank's upcoming decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that achieving global leadership in artificial intelligence requires a fundamental shift in national education strategies. The author contends that success is not just about producing elite machine-learning engineers, but about reskilling the entire workforce to understand how AI can augment their specific roles across all industries. To achieve this, governments should invest in accessible platforms that democratize AI knowledge, enabling citizens to migrate from low-value work to higher-level tasks. This broad-based approach is presented as the key to unlocking true national productivity and competitiveness.</p>

According to retail data analysis, this shift is primarily driven by persistent inflation, which has diminished the financial comfort of many middle- and even high-income households. In response to this new demographic, discount retailers are actively upgrading their store environments and expanding their product selections to include more premium brands, aiming to better cater to the expectations of these value-conscious, higher-income shoppers.</p>
