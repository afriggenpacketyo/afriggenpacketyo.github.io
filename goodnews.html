          <p>Poland's presidential election is extremely close, with exit polls suggesting a narrow victory for Warsaw's liberal Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski over conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. The margin of error makes the outcome uncertain, and the official result is expected the following morning. Trzaskowski claimed victory while Nawrocki urged his supporters to remain hopeful, highlighting the tight nature of the race. The outcome of this election will have implications for Poland's political direction and its relationship with the European Union. </p>
