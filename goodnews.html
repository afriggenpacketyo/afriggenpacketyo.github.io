          <h2>Trump Considers Tax Hike on Wealthy to Protect Medicaid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump proposes creating a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move would partially reverse tax cuts from 2017 and aims to offset spending cuts to Medicaid, addressing concerns about the optics of benefiting the rich while cutting benefits for the poor. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>India is considering a trade deal with the U.S. that would involve zero tariffs on certain imports like steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a shift from its protectionist policies. Experts suggest that while the deal could boost economic growth and foreign investment, India will be careful not to harm domestic businesses. The impact on sectors like steel and pharmaceuticals may be limited, but logistics companies are expected to benefit from increased trade.

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported disappointing first-quarter results due to inclement weather, but early signs of a stronger second quarter have boosted investor confidence. While earnings per share missed expectations, revenue exceeded estimates, and comparable store sales showed positive growth. The company's average weekly sales hit all-time highs in March, with company restaurants experiencing a 5% year-over-year increase in comparable sales in the first five weeks of the second quarter. Despite rising commodity cost inflation, Texas Roadhouse's brand strength and value proposition continue to attract customers.</p>

          <p>The enforcement of skort wearing in camogie has sparked a debate about sexism, with former All-Star Jane Adams calling for the Camogie Association to allow players a choice between skorts and shorts. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress to vote on the issue, highlighting the growing pressure from county and club teams to relax the rule. Some players argue that skorts are impractical and uncomfortable, while others believe there are more pressing issues facing women's sports.</p>
