        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady, citing expectations of higher inflation and slower economic growth, while still indicating the possibility of two rate cuts later in 2025. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept its key borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December 2024. The committee's "dot plot" suggests continued uncertainty among Fed officials about future rates, with a wide dispersion of expectations. Economic projections point to stagflationary pressures, with GDP advancing at a 1.4% pace in 2025 and inflation hitting 3% (not investment advice).</p>

The network was connected to at least 400 suspected victims worldwide, including dozens in the U.S. According to FBI data, crypto fraud was responsible for more than $5.8 billion in reported losses last year.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amid mixed economic signals. While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. The Fed's goal is to maintain low inflation and a healthy job market. The central bank expects inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, to rise to 3% by year-end and unemployment to increase to 4.5% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Gilead's twice-yearly antiviral injection, Yeztugo, for HIV prevention, a development that could significantly impact the decades-long epidemic. This new option offers a more convenient alternative to existing daily pills and less frequent injections. The annual list price for Yeztugo is $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, but Gilead offers programs to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Clinical trials have demonstrated the injection's high efficacy in preventing HIV infection, offering hope for bending the arc of the epidemic.</p>
