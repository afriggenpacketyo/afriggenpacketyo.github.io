          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year budget of €2 trillion, which includes a significant fivefold increase in defense and space funding to €131 billion. This proposal, part of a new European Competitiveness Fund, aims to bolster investment and address current geopolitical realities. The budget also allocates approximately 35% to climate and biodiversity initiatives. The plan must still gain approval from the European Parliament and member states, where it may undergo further modifications before being finalized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. decision to ease export restrictions on certain advanced AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD is being viewed by experts as a positive signal for bilateral trade relations with China. This move allows for the review of license applications to resume sales of specific chips to the Chinese market. Analysts suggest this development represents a significant win for Beijing and indicates that high-level negotiations are steering the complex relationship in a more constructive direction, potentially resetting the tone of the ongoing tech and trade standoff.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Gdańsk, Poland, have discovered the complete skeleton of a medieval knight buried beneath the site of a former ice cream shop. The well-preserved remains were found just below an engraved limestone tombstone dating to the 13th or 14th century. The knight was estimated to be around 40 years old and stood between 5'6" and 5'10" tall. Researchers are now conducting further analysis on the skeleton and other artifacts to learn more about the individual and the historical period.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with earnings per share at $2.13 against an expected $1.96. The bank's strong performance was fueled by a significant increase in trading revenues, particularly in equities, leading to a 13% rise in net income to $3.5 billion. The institutional securities and wealth management divisions both delivered robust net revenues, reflecting higher client activity and asset management fees. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of consistent earnings for the financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of America posted mixed second-quarter results, beating earnings estimates but falling short on revenue, making it the only major U.S. bank to do so. Profit climbed 3% to $7.12 billion, while revenue rose 4% to $26.61 billion, slightly below expectations. The miss was attributed to net interest income (NII) coming in lower than anticipated, as lower interest rates offset loan and deposit growth. Despite the mixed report, the CEO highlighted consumer resilience and positive momentum in the bank's markets businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

The review, prompted by safety concerns after the deaths of patients treated by PAs, also suggests they wear standardized clothing and see new patients only in limited circumstances. The government has accepted all recommendations, aiming to provide clarity on qualifications and roles, though the union representing PAs has warned the changes could lengthen patient waiting lists.</p>
