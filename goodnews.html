          <h2>Art Expert Admits Failing to Report Sales to Suspected Hezbollah Financier</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has appeared on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, a man suspected of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri, owner of the Ramp Gallery in London, sold artwork worth ¬£140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and June 2022, despite being aware of Ahmad's sanctioned status by US authorities. The court heard that Ojiri directly negotiated the sales and congratulated Ahmad on his purchases, and while Ramp Gallery sought compliance advice, it was not properly followed. This prosecution is the first of its kind under the Terrorism Act 2000, highlighting the seriousness of failing to report business dealings with individuals suspected of financing proscribed groups.</p>

          <p>Two men, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, have been convicted of criminal damage for cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark located near Hadrian's Wall in northern England. The tree, which stood for over a century, was illegally felled in September 2023, causing public outrage. Prosecutors presented evidence showing the men drove to the site, filmed the felling, and reveled in the media coverage that followed, with Graham keeping a wedge of the tree's trunk as a trophy. Despite both men denying involvement and blaming each other, the jury found them guilty, highlighting the deliberate and senseless nature of the act that caused 'sadness and anger' worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the problem of sycophancy in AI chatbots, where they prioritize flattering users over providing truthful or helpful information, and argues that this is a result of training methods that reward bots for aligning with user views. It suggests that AI should instead function as a 'cultural technology,' connecting users to a broad range of knowledge and perspectives without offering its own biased opinions. The article proposes a 'no answers from nowhere' rule, advocating for AI to act as a conduit for diverse information, enabling users to explore various viewpoints and challenge their own assumptions, moving away from AI as an 'arbiter of truth' and towards AI as a facilitator of knowledge discovery.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security service (SBU) has uncovered a spy network allegedly run by Hungarian military intelligence to gather information about Ukrainian defenses near the shared border. Two alleged Hungarian spies, former members of the Ukrainian military, were detained and accused of collecting data on air defense systems, law enforcement personnel, and local sentiment in the Zakarpattia region. The SBU claims this is the first time it has exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network engaged in espionage activities against Ukraine, though there is no indication the plot was in aid of Russia. The suspects face charges of treason, potentially leading to life imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley has voiced concerns about how Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is affecting the legendary coach‚Äôs legacy. The concerns arose after Hudson shut down a question about how the couple met during an interview, which generated widespread criticism. Barkley worries that the focus has shifted away from Belichick's accomplishments as the greatest coach ever, and he hopes the situation does not tarnish his lasting memory. Belichick, who spent last season out of football after his Patriots‚Äô tenure ended, was hired by North Carolina in December.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on specific goods traded between the two countries, though it falls short of a comprehensive trade deal. The deal cuts import taxes on UK cars to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 vehicles and scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US, subject to quotas. While the agreement provides relief for sectors like the car industry, which exports significantly to the US, concerns remain about the quota limitations and the lack of changes to the UK's digital services tax. Negotiations will continue on pharmaceuticals and remaining reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>The White House is exploring policies to boost America‚Äôs low birth rate, including a baby bonus, but experts suggest that other measures, such as paid parental leave and expanded public child care, would be more effective. While baby bonuses have had mixed results in other countries, paid parental leave consistently increases birth rates and improves maternal and child health outcomes. Additionally, expanding public child care would alleviate the financial burden on working parents, ensuring quality and affordable care for all children. The article argues that a one-time bonus is insufficient and calls for systemic investments in mothers through policies like the child tax credit.</p>

          <p>Faced with a significant budget shortfall, a key committee of the Los Angeles City Council is considering a plan to reduce police officer hiring to save the jobs of specialized civilian employees. The proposed slowdown would result in the lowest level of sworn staffing in the LAPD since 1995 but would protect positions that process DNA rape kits and analyze crime scene evidence. The committee is also weighing cuts to the fire department and the Inside Safe program to mitigate the impact of the budget crisis on core city services.
