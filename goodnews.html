          <h2>Geely Auto to Halt New Plant Construction Amid Global Overcapacity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 01:30:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Geely Auto, China's second-largest carmaker, announced it will cease building new car plants due to significant global overcapacity, as stated by Chairman Li Shufu at the Chongqing Auto Show. This decision reflects the intense price war in the Chinese automotive market, where companies like BYD and Leapmotor have slashed prices to maintain market share. Geely will instead focus on enhancing its technological capabilities to become a key player in the future of mobility, amidst concerns that most Chinese companies are struggling to maintain profitability. The move signals a strategic shift towards improving existing resources rather than expanding production capacity. </p>

          <p>Australian all-rounder Beau Webster discussed his journey from a part-time off-spinner to a seam-bowling all-rounder, a transition that significantly impacted his cricket career. Webster initially dabbled in other professions, including building and mortgage broking, but found his niche when he developed his seam-bowling skills during the Covid pandemic with the help of coach Adam Griffith. He recounts overcoming skepticism from teammates like Usman Khawaja, who initially viewed his pace bowling as a gimmick. Webster's ability to hold down a place in the Australia team at number six is a testament to his hard work. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of 34.5% in May, marking the steepest drop since February 2020, due to ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. Overall exports rose 4.8%, falling short of expectations, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Chinese officials are expected to meet with U.S. trade representatives in London for renewed trade talks, as markets watch for potential further monetary easing measures from Beijing.

          <p>China's export growth slowed in May due to reduced U.S. orders before the implementation of a 90-day tariff truce. Exports increased by 4.8% year-on-year, but exports to the United States plunged by 34.52%. Despite this, economists anticipate improvements in June, although China's manufacturing and trade sectors remain strained by lingering tariff uncertainties. The customs data released on Monday shows that China's exports were up to $316.1 billion in May. </p>

Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal would extend the prohibition of bottom trawling from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 in the UK's offshore protected areas. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France and warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling. </p>
