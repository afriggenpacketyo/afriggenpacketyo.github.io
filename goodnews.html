          <h2>Japan's Cruise Industry Experiences Post-Pandemic Revival</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic, with record domestic passenger numbers and a quadrupling of international visitors. Japanese shipping giants like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines are investing in cruise ships as a means of generating stable income streams, especially with their core cargo businesses affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs. NYK Cruises will launch the Asuka III, while Mitsui Ocean Cruises will add a third ship, and Oriental Land, which operates Tokyo Disney Resort, will take over the operation and management of cruise ships scheduled to enter service in fiscal 2028. This reflects a broader recovery in leisure travel and a boost to local economies reliant on tourism.</p>

          <p>XPrize founder Peter Diamandis emphasizes the shared nature of human biology, math, physics, and chemistry across the globe, highlighting that breakthroughs in one country benefit all of humanity. He contrasts this vision with the current political climate, where the U.S. has sought to curb international student visas and cut scientific funding. Diamandis expresses concern over these cuts, particularly at the National Institutes of Health, and their potential long-term implications for scientific discovery. Despite these challenges, Diamandis remains optimistic, aiming to help people see the world in a positive light through his work.</p>

          <h2>University Course Cuts Could Lead to Subject Cold Spots for Students</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as financial challenges lead to course cutbacks. Universities UK found that institutions are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws, which promote competition. Greater collaboration could help universities cut costs and become more efficient, ensuring students have access to desired subjects in their home regions. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial problems facing universities and aims to support collaboration where possible, though significant changes may require government action.</p>

          <p>The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives offers a look into a version of Mormon life far removed from traditional public perception, set in suburban Utah and following a group of Mormon women managing scandals and marital breakdowns. The women, who gained fame on TikTok, navigate challenges related to money, family, and competition, while also addressing the impact of having their lives watched by millions. The show highlights the importance of aftercare, with therapists on hand to support the cast through the emotional demands of filming.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa faces a political firestorm after approving a law that allows the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation. The law, intended to increase black ownership of land, has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and local political parties, who fear it threatens property rights. The government insists compensation will be paid in most cases, particularly for productive agricultural land, while legal experts suggest expropriation without compensation would occur only in limited circumstances. The new law is expected to make it easier for the government to acquire land and restore it to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing and returning her Jan. 6 pardon, citing guilt and rejecting the narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection, believes the pardons contribute to lies and propaganda. Unlike other Jan. 6 defendants who sought their pardons, Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to formally refuse the clemency. Her actions contrast with those who championed their pardons and used them in court, underscoring her belief in accountability for the events of that day.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding an election following a martial law crisis last December, where President Yoon Suk Yeol attempted a military takeover, leading to his impeachment. The leading opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, has been campaigning in a bullet-proof vest due to death threats, highlighting the country's increased polarization and political violence. This election is seen as an opportunity to steer South Korea back to stability and heal divisions, with Lee promising to prevent future martial law declarations. Recent polls show Lee ahead of his rival, Kim Moon-soo, but the election remains a referendum on the martial law crisis.</p>
