The plan includes space-based weapons sensors and research into orbital components, building on existing defense systems in Alaska and creating new sites across the country.

          <p>New York City mayoral candidates, particularly Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, are framing their campaigns as a battle against President Trump in their closing arguments. Cuomo characterizes Trump's actions as a war on Democratic states and cities, while Mamdani positions himself as the candidate to address authoritarianism from the outside and the affordability crisis within the city. Voters are considering both national and local issues, particularly affordability, as they make their choices. The election could be impacted by high temperatures and potential heat-related power outages.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, Morgan State University archivist, discusses the significance of Juneteenth, the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned of their freedom. Juneteenth allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and identities as both African and American. Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, visiting museums to understand the history, and recognizing the sacrifices made for freedom. Learning about Juneteenth helps us understand collective ancestry and the importance of intellectual nutrition.</p>
