          <p>E-commerce company Shopify saw its stock price surge by over 20% after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The company also provided an optimistic forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage range. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Hoffmeister noted that a potential negative impact from U.S. tariffs, which the company had factored into its guidance, did not occur. This strong performance suggests consumer spending remains robust despite broader macroeconomic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona Diamondbacks' designated hitter Lourdes Gurriel Jr. has set a new Major League Baseball record by hitting a home run off a pitch clocked at 103.9 mph. The historic hit occurred during a game against the San Diego Padres, off a fastball from reliever Mason Miller. The two-run homer traveled 439 feet and tied the game in the eighth inning, though the Diamondbacks ultimately lost in extra innings. This is the fastest pitch hit for a home run since MLB began tracking pitch speeds in 2008, highlighting a remarkable feat of athletic timing and power.</p>

          <h2>New Research Reveals Trees Host Vast and Diverse Internal Microbiomes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 11:44:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Nature has found that trees contain complex internal ecosystems of microbes, similar to the human microbiome. By sampling the DNA of 150 trees, researchers discovered that an average tree is home to approximately one trillion microbial cells, including a rich diversity of fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The study revealed that different parts of the tree, such as the inner heartwood and outer sapwood, host distinct and specialized microbial communities. This research redefines trees as integrated ecosystems and opens new avenues for understanding forest health, resilience, and carbon cycling.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced it will increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The announcement came as the company faces significant pressure from the Trump administration to expand its manufacturing and supply chain within the U.S. President Trump has threatened tariffs on Apple's products if it does not move more production from countries like China. The new investment is seen as a response to this pressure and the broader "reciprocal" tariff environment, which has already cost the company hundreds of millions.</p>

          <p>A series of minor earthquakes rattled parts of Southern California's Inland Empire early Wednesday morning, though no damage or injuries were reported. The sequence included four quakes with magnitudes ranging from 3.2 to 3.7, centered in the areas of Ontario and Lytle Creek. The tremors were felt locally and followed a slightly larger magnitude 4.3 earthquake that occurred in the region last week. While the seismic activity was noticeable to residents, its small scale did not cause any significant disruption or require an emergency response from authorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece from The Atlantic argues that modern "therapy culture" places an excessive and scientifically dubious burden of guilt on mothers. The author, a psychologist, critiques the notion that minor parenting missteps can cause lifelong psychological damage to children, a concept she traces back to historical mother-blaming theories. The article contends that research shows factors like genetics and peer influence often play a larger role in a child's development than small variations in parenting. It concludes that this focus on psychological perfection distracts from the real structural challenges mothers face, such as a lack of affordable childcare and maternity leave.</p>

          <p>This article from NPR's "Far-Flung Postcards" series offers a glimpse into life in a village in Gujarat, India, centered around a banyan tree. The author describes the tree as a vital community hub, providing shade, a place for rest, and a site for spiritual reverence in both Hindu and Muslim cultures. The scene captures men relaxing in the afternoon heat near a stall selling paan, a traditional chewable mixture. This tranquil moment is contrasted with the sight of young women performing the grueling daily task of carrying heavy pots of water, painting a rich and layered picture of village life.</p>

          <h2>Lending Experts Predict Housing Affordability for the Fall Will Hinge on Mortgage Rate Stability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 11:11:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Housing affordability in the upcoming fall season is expected to be heavily influenced by the stability of mortgage rates, according to lending experts. While some forecasts predict a slight drop in rates by year's end, many believe they will remain relatively steady, which could prevent the market volatility that makes planning difficult for buyers and sellers. Inventory is generally rising, which could help ease prices, but this varies significantly by market. Experts suggest that if rates stay high, prices may see a slight decline, but a significant drop below 6% could reignite buyer competition and drive prices up. (not investment advice)</p>
