        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst military strikes in Iran, concerns are rising about the potential impact on global oil supplies and energy prices. Initial market reactions saw price fluctuations, with West Texas Intermediate crude initially jumping before declining. Experts believe a complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz is unlikely, but ongoing regional tensions pose a risk to energy markets, potentially driving prices higher if oil production facilities are targeted. Disruptions to oil flow through the Strait would severely impact countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea, and a worst-case scenario could see prices spike to $130 per barrel, reducing global GDP by 0.8%.

          <p>The United Kingdom has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target expected to be agreed upon at a summit in the Netherlands. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas, providing EU countries with flexibility in meeting the target. The announcement has drawn criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who argues for immediate funding increases due to current geopolitical threats. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of economic security as national security, aiming to create jobs and growth for working people through this strategy.</p>

          <p>The Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. is considering designating Google with "strategic market status," potentially leading to changes in its online search services. This action comes under new competition rules granting the CMA expanded powers to enforce consumer protections on tech giants. Similar to the EU's Digital Markets Act, the legislation allows the CMA to take action, including imposing fines of up to 10% of global annual revenues for breaches. The CMA's consultation raises questions about Google's market power and its impact on competition within the U.K.</p>

He has been influenced by thinkers like Patrick Deneen and commentators on the new right, leading him to question the free-market fundamentalism that has crept into the Democratic Party.
