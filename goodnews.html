          <p>Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports and a fervent University of Michigan supporter, made his debut on Fox's "Big Noon Kickoff" show with a theatrical stunt. Ahead of the Ohio State versus Texas game, Portnoy appeared in a disguise, including a fake mustache and an "I Love Ryan Day" hat. This act played into a manufactured drama where he claimed to be banned from Ohio Stadium by the team's coach, a claim Ohio State officials had previously clarified was not true, stating he simply wasn't part of the credentialed desk crew allowed inside.</p>

Throughout their arduous journey, they endured severe weather and injuries while successfully raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Investment Management has acquired a significant stake in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT specializing in Southern California industrial properties. The article suggests Elliott will likely push for substantial changes due to Rexford's stock trading at a discount to its net asset value and concerns over corporate governance, such as its management-friendly Maryland domicile. Elliott's involvement could lead to strategic shifts, including a potential sale of the company to maximize shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced a 12% drop in visitors in July compared to the previous year, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline. In response to concerns that the city has become overpriced, the head of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Steve Hill, argued that the destination still offers competitive value and that resorts are actively offering promotions. Despite the fall in visitor numbers, Nevada's gaming revenue remains strong, suggesting that those who do visit are spending more.</p>

          <p>The American dining landscape is witnessing a significant evolution in Indian cuisine, moving away from buffets and takeout toward sophisticated, upscale experiences. This article highlights how chefs like Vikas Khanna are focusing on hyper-regional and authentic flavors, attracting a wave of enthusiastic diners and, consequently, serious investor interest. This boom is driven by a growing consumer desire for unique global culinary experiences and has led to private equity firms backing Indian restaurant chains as they plan U.S. expansion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing federal officials to prosecute individuals who burn the American flag whenever possible. However, this legal analysis argues that the order is largely symbolic and unenforceable due to two landmark Supreme Court decisions from 1989 and 1990 that protect flag-burning as a form of free speech under the First Amendment. The author suggests the order might even backfire by giving defendants a potential "selective prosecution" defense, as it explicitly targets the message behind the act.</p>

          <p>This article examines the ongoing policy debate surrounding direct cash transfers as a tool to fight poverty. While large-scale, established programs like Social Security have proven highly effective, a new set of smaller, guaranteed-income pilot studies have shown disappointing results in producing sustained improvements in areas like health, stress, or employment. The author cautions against overinterpreting these limited new findings, arguing they occurred during a unique post-pandemic economy and that decades of broader research confirm cash transfers successfully reduce poverty itself.</p>
