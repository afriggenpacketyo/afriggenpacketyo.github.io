          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang downplayed concerns that the company's advanced chips could be used by China's military, arguing that Beijing cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. In an interview ahead of another trip to China, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to establishing American technology as the global standard. Despite billions in losses from the restrictions, Huang is navigating the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing, even as U.S. officials express skepticism about his claims.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement includes compensation and a nonexclusive license for Windsurf's technology, allowing the startup to continue operating independently. This move highlights the escalating "talent war" in the artificial intelligence sector, following similar high-profile hires and investments by competitors like Meta and Microsoft. Windsurf, known for its innovative coding tools, had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs saw inflows of $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional interest. Analysts suggest this momentum, fueled by long-term institutional buyers, could push the cryptocurrency's value even higher in the near future. The rally also coincides with growing anticipation for new U.S. crypto legislation aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports in June grew by 5.8% year-over-year, exceeding economists' forecasts, largely due to strong shipments to non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. A temporary truce in the trade war with the United States also helped slow the decline in exports to America. While imports saw their first increase of the year, the rise was modest, suggesting continued sluggish domestic demand. The data reflects Chinese exporters' successful diversification efforts as they navigate ongoing trade tensions and work towards a durable deal with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 00:04:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indian government has proposed a new rule requiring that air conditioners be manufactured with a minimum temperature setting of 20°C (68°F) to curb rising electricity consumption. With millions of AC units sold annually, officials estimate that for each degree the temperature is raised, energy savings of about 6% can be achieved. The measure aims to address the strain on the power grid, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, especially as AC use drives peak demand. Experts support the move but also emphasize the need for stricter energy efficiency standards.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This economic rebound is partly attributed to a temporary pause in U.S.-China tariffs, which may have prompted businesses to front-load exports. Despite the positive figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing "significant uncertainty and downside risks" in the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>
