          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The tremors were felt across parts of the New York City area and as far as Connecticut, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this event was minor and not expected to cause significant issues. This follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude quake that shook the region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released after being held in an ICE detention facility for two months. Clouatre was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card interview, learning of a years-old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, advocated for her release, which drew public attention and support from Senator John Kennedy's office. While released on bond with an ankle monitor, she still faces a lengthy immigration court process.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving the purchase of military drones and electronic warfare systems. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, praising the agencies for their work. The arrests come shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests, a key step in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. The venture has reportedly attracted over 600,000 supporters, who are being invited to help choose a name that reflects the party's platform. Political and branding experts note the difficulty and importance of selecting a name that is modern, resonant, and avoids ridicule. The party cannot field election candidates until it registers an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties.</p>

          <p>The 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but it perished just days from England. For decades, the accepted story was that the animal died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, new research by Australian university students and museum archivists, who analyzed the attendant's logbook, revealed the platypus likely died from heatstroke due to inadequately regulated water temperatures as the ship crossed the equator.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of major theme parks to boost its economy and drive local consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, with over 4,400 amusement facilities now operating nationwide. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, the industry is a significant economic driver, with every yuan of revenue generating nearly four yuan in the local economy. This strategy is part of a broader effort to encourage domestic tourism and consumption as a pillar of economic growth.</p>
