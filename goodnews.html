          <p>Deliveroo, a UK-based food delivery app, has agreed to be acquired by US giant DoorDash for ¬£2.9 billion, creating a combined company with a presence in over 40 countries. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, aims to strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce and provide competition to rivals like Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. The article notes that this takeover raises concerns about UK investment as another UK-listed company is acquired by a US firm, with the combined company projected to serve approximately 50 million customers monthly.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss increased after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties. Revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts, driven by weaker demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. CEO Daniel Grieder confirmed the company's 2025 outlook, while noting that global trade tensions have impacted demand, adding that the company is monitoring the economic outlook closely. The article discusses the company's strategic overhaul to revive consumer demand and expand its appeal beyond formal wear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economic narrative has been defined by supply-side reform, focusing on boosting productivity and cultivating new technologies, leading to global leadership in electric vehicles and AI. However, the time has come for a shift towards prioritizing demand, as signaled by the Communist Party's Politburo emphasizing the "four stabilities" and the need to boost household income and consumption. While China has successfully tackled industrial sectors and reined in property market speculation, supply-side success does not automatically translate into strength in demand, posing a significant challenge for the country.</p>

          <p>The UK government is providing ¬£102m to around one in six GP practices in England to help them improve their buildings, marking the biggest public investment in facilities for five years. The funding aims to expand and modernize surgeries, with projects including converting office space into clinical consulting rooms and building new practices. This comes as satisfaction levels with GP services have hit record lows, and figures suggest two in five GPs report their practices are not fit for purpose. The Royal College of GPs described the funding as an "encouraging interim measure", while highlighting the need for long-term investment to tackle inadequate infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created what they claim is the world's smallest and lightest wireless robot, capable of changing form to travel on land or in the air. Inspired by Lego, the microrobot could be used in complex environments such as disaster rescue operations. The robot utilizes a "morphable actuator" that converts energy into force, which the researchers say could also be used in medical devices and components for virtual and augmented reality. The robot boasts the smallest size, lightest weight, and fastest ground movement speed compared to other known wireless land-air robots.</p>
