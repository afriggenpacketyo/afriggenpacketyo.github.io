          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines, potentially providing critical advantages for both military and civilian aircraft. The new alloy turbine blades can withstand temperatures up to 15% higher than existing versions, which could lead to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The patent was granted to the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), which has been leading research on military and civilian plane engines.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a propellant leak and subsequent loss of attitude control, leading to an uncontrolled re-entry and likely disintegration over the Indian Ocean. The ninth test flight demonstrated successful orbit, however, an apparent propellant leak after the craft entered its suborbital trajectory caused a loss of attitude control, leaving the spacecraft spinning and mission control unable to control the craft. The company stated that it will continue to review data and improve Starship's reliability. SpaceX aims for Starship to be fully reusable and capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance as part of its iterative engineering approach.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalised. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, makes 42 recommendations, including removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalisation. The report also recommends improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education.</p>

According to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW), 43,626 puffins were counted on Skomer Island this year, a record high. The increased number of puffins is attributed to an abundance of food and a lack of predators on the island.

The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance, and carbon credits will need to be purchased for emissions exceeding that threshold. The ability to sell surplus credits is intended to incentivize companies to reduce emissions.</p>
