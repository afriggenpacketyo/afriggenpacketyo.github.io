          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 08:41:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, remained at 2.9% annually in August, aligning with economists' expectations. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests the central bank may proceed with its anticipated interest rate reductions. The Commerce Department report also indicated that consumer spending and income grew slightly more than forecasted, showing economic resilience. These stable inflation readings are unlikely to alter the Fed's current policy trajectory toward further monetary easing this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, aims to address the U.S. housing crisis by using federal incentives to encourage local governments to ease zoning restrictions. Spearheaded by Senators Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren, the legislation would create model zoning codes and offer grants to municipalities that successfully increase their housing supply. This approach seeks to overcome local opposition to new construction, which often stifles development despite regional benefits. The proposal is modeled on the concept of "Right-to-Build Zones," which would allow developers to operate under simpler, less restrictive rules in designated areas.</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because prosecutors failed to obtain the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has signaled a willingness to engage in another round of discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a positive personal bond from their previous meetings. However, Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear program is non-negotiable and that any talks are contingent on Washington abandoning its "obsession with denuclearization." This development comes as North Korea has advanced its weapons capabilities and strengthened ties with Russia and China. While Trump has also indicated an interest in meeting, the fundamental disagreement over denuclearization remains a significant obstacle to a potential fourth summit.</p>

          <p>Costco announced fourth-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with an 8% year-over-year revenue increase to $86.16 billion. The wholesale retailer's performance was driven by solid sales growth and improved gross margins, which were credited to supply chain enhancements and a higher penetration of its private-label Kirkland Signature brand. However, the company reported a slight decline in membership renewal rates, partly due to an increase in online sign-ups, which historically have lower renewal rates. Despite this, membership fee income grew by 14%, reflecting a recent price increase and upgrades to executive memberships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paccar, the parent company of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, saw its stock price jump over 6% after President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. Trump stated the measure was intended to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. Analysts noted that Paccar, which produces over 90% of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, stands to benefit significantly from the tariff. The new levy is expected to level the playing field against competitors who manufacture in countries like Mexico, where production costs are lower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan has paused its plan to implement unilateral export controls on semiconductor products to South Africa, following a diplomatic disagreement over the status of Taipei's representative office in Pretoria. The controls, which would have required prior approval for shipping 47 different products, including memory chips, were announced after South Africa reportedly demanded changes to the office's name. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs stated the suspension came after discussions with the foreign ministry, as the South African government has now agreed to hold further talks on the matter, temporarily shelving its initial demand.</p>

          <p>An essay in the Los Angeles Times details the personal challenges of a marriage between a New York Yankees fan who opposes Donald Trump and her husband, a Los Angeles Dodgers fan and a staunch MAGA supporter. The author reflects on the advice from their marriage counselor to avoid political discussions to preserve their 15-year relationship. She describes the tension of living with someone whose political views she finds baffling, particularly as a Latina woman. Ultimately, she concludes that their bond, built on mutual kindness, humor, and support, is strong enough to overcome these fundamental disagreements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Understanding how a financial advisor is paid is crucial for investors, yet many consumers are unaware of the fee structures involved. Compensation typically falls into two categories: commission-based, where advisors earn money for selling specific products, and fee-based, which includes models like a percentage of assets under management (AUM), flat fees, or hourly rates. Each model presents different potential conflicts of interest and benefits. Experts advise clients to ask direct questions about how an advisor earns money to ensure transparency and protect their financial returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite high-profile venture capital deals, the investment firms of the ultra-wealthy are primarily gaining exposure to the artificial intelligence boom through public equities rather than direct startup investments. A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 family offices found that 52% invest in AI via stocks or ETFs, compared to just 25% investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is partly attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies within major stock indices like the S&P 500. Energy and materials firms benefiting from AI's growth are also popular secondary investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judy Blume's groundbreaking 1975 novel "Forever..." is celebrating its 50th anniversary, prompting reflection on its lasting cultural impact. The book, which candidly depicted teenage sexuality, love, and contraception from a young woman's perspective, became a rite of passage for generations of adolescents. It was radical for its time, validating female desire and agency, and consequently faced decades of controversy and book-banning attempts. While today's teens have different avenues for information, the article considers the novel's role in encouraging an intentional and intimate understanding of sexuality that may still hold relevance.</p>
