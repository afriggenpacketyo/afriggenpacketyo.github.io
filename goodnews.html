          <p>China's aviation authority is surveying the country's airlines about their future fleet requirements, specifically asking about potential orders for Boeing aircraft. This move suggests a possible thaw in trade relations between Beijing and Washington, as Boeing has often been caught in the middle of bilateral tensions. The director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China met with a Boeing senior vice-president to discuss expanding cooperation. Industry insiders believe this could signal that Boeing is positioned to benefit if a broader trade deal is reached between the two nations.</p>

This development is seen as a significant boost for the American LNG sector, as it secures a large, long-term market for its exports and contributes to European energy security.

          <h2>Understanding the 4% Rule and Its Application to Annuities for Retirement Planning</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirees to estimate safe annual withdrawal amounts from their savings. The rule suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio in the first year of retirement, and adjusting for inflation thereafter, to make savings last for about 30 years. When applied to annuities, the rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against what a traditional portfolio might provide. This comparison helps retirees evaluate trade-offs between an annuity's security and a portfolio's flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
