          <h2>New York City to Use Ranked Choice Voting in Mayoral Primary</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is implementing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate secures a majority. While proponents say this system prevents wasted votes and ensures broad support for the winner, critics worry about transparency and the potential for unexpected results.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces a potential period without giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, China may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Foreign affairs experts speculate a new loan may be announced during a potential visit by a Chinese leader to Japan. The decision to loan pandas is often revealed during high-level bilateral talks, symbolizing friendship and providing economic benefits as tourist attractions.</p>
