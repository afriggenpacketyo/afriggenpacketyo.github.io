Kelce's father confirmed the proposal happened two weeks prior in a Missouri garden.

          <p>Former Australian Rules Football (AFL) player Mitch Brown has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown, who played for the West Coast Eagles, revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly contributed to his retirement decision. He hopes his public announcement will foster a safer and more accepting environment for others. Brown criticized the AFL's "hyper-masculinity" and recounted experiencing homophobic comments and a teammate's discomfort with gay men. Experts believe this article's candidness about the sport's cultural issues could drive significant behavioral changes at the grassroots level, inspiring other closeted players.</p>

          <p>European markets opened higher, with traders keenly focused on the upcoming quarterly earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, a key indicator for the global technology sector and the artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia's performance significantly influences US market trends due to its large weighting in the S&P 500. France's CAC 40 index rebounded after a decline caused by political instability concerns regarding a confidence vote for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's budget. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has seen a strong month overall, despite recent dips, with broad-based gains observed across various sectors as US futures also showed slight increases. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, adding to the global economic picture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Starship rocket for its 10th test flight, overcoming a series of previous fiery failures. The more than 400-foot rocket, crucial for NASA's lunar ambitions and SpaceX's commercial dominance, achieved its first successful payload deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites. It also relit its Raptor engine in orbit and stress-tested its reusable heat shield, a critical development for Elon Musk's vision of fully reusable spacecraft. Both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft completed controlled splashdowns, marking a significant step forward for the Artemis program and Musk's long-term goal of Mars colonization. Interim NASA head Sean Duffy congratulated SpaceX on social media.</p>

          <p>Moldova, a small country bordering Ukraine, has gained increasing geopolitical importance since Russia's 2022 invasion, with concerns about potential Russian expansion. In a show of solidarity, the EU granted Moldova candidate status, and several European nations, including Germany, provide military support. The article details Moldova's history of independence from Russia and the Soviet Union, its linguistic identity, and the ongoing, internationally unrecognized Transnistria conflict, where Russian troops support separatists. Russia's influence, traditionally exerted through economic levers and propaganda, persists, but Moldova has diversified economically. Despite strong ties with Romania, reunification is not currently favored by most Moldovans, though deeper integration is expected.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is displaying initial signs of recovery, with some major developers reporting stronger earnings and reduced losses. State-owned China Resources Land saw its first-half net profit increase by 16.2%, while privately owned Sunac significantly narrowed its interim loss by 14.4%. These improved results are attributed to a recovery in mainland China's retail consumption and the government's supportive stimulus measures for the industry. This article highlights CR Land's growth in property development and a surge in retail sales from its shopping malls, suggesting that policy lifelines are beginning to alleviate the financial strains that plagued developers just a year ago.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a remarkable miniature 10th-century figurine, believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking. Carved from walrus tusk, the 1.2-inch piece depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and a neat hairstyle, challenging the common perception of Vikings as savage. Curator Peter Pentz suggests the figure, possibly representing a king like Harald Bluetooth, signifies wealth and status through its detailed grooming. Originally found in Norway in 1796 and forgotten in archives, its unique, smiling expression and individual details contrast sharply with other, simpler Viking-era human depictions, making it a significant archaeological discovery. This find provides new insights into Viking Age art.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system designed to make its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. This breakthrough, announced by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, is a significant step in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors use high-energy neutrons for greater fuel efficiency and can act as breeders, converting consumed fuel into more fissile material for reuse. Integral fast reactors, which use liquid metal coolants, are characterized by reprocessing spent fuel within the same facility, enhancing safety and sustainability in nuclear energy production. This technology represents a major advancement in nuclear safety.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, with declines narrowing to 1.5% year-on-year, a significant improvement from previous months. This positive shift is attributed to Beijing's intensified campaign against "involution" or excessive competition and price wars, which had previously strained company profitability. While overall profits for major industrial firms still fell by 1.7% in the first seven months, manufacturing and utilities sectors showed improvements, contrasting with a sharp plunge in mining industry profits. The government's policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels and curbing aggressive price-cutting are beginning to show early effects, although analysts suggest sustained recovery may require further industry consolidation.

However, a playing captain has not occurred in 62 years, and the intense scrutiny surrounding such a decision is unprecedented. With his passion for the American cause and recent strong performances, Bradley must weigh his personal desire to play against the best chance for the team to reclaim the trophy, acknowledging the difficulty of disappointing other deserving players.

          <p>In the first half of 2025, leisure travel to the United States experienced a downturn, but business travel to the country remained robust, according to a report from SAP Concur. The US emerged as the top global destination for business travelers, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly surpassing Germany and the UK. This trend suggests that despite broader negative travel sentiment in other regions and ongoing global economic tensions, corporate interests in the United States are largely unaffected. The slight increase in inbound business travel volume, while lower than the global average, aligns with normal seasonal patterns, indicating sustained corporate engagement.
