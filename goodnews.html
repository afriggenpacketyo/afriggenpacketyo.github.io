          <p>England's rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to nearby lightning strikes, forcing players off the field and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, Steve Borthwick's side scored six tries, completing their tour of Argentina and the United States with a perfect three-win record. The match also served as an opportunity for several players to make their England debuts.</p>

          <p>Following last year's deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law targeting individuals preparing for mass casualty events without a clear ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. Currently, proving a link to a specific ideology is required for such charges. The change would empower authorities to act against violence-obsessed individuals who research targets or plan attacks, regardless of their motivation.</p>

          <p>Singer Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned midair. While performing her hit song "Roar," the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the artist before she quickly recovered and continued the performance. After the prop safely returned her to the stage, she quipped, "Not today, Satan," to the audience. The incident was a minor disruption in her "The Lifetimes Tour," which features multiple aerial stunts and props.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Explores Ways to Encourage Savings Shift from Cash to Investments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:04:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that savers are missing out on potential financial rewards because the benefits of investing are often overshadowed by risk warnings. The government is considering initiatives to encourage a shift from low-interest cash savings accounts to stocks and shares ISAs to boost the UK economy. Proposals include sending information about investment opportunities to savers and a new advertising campaign, though a controversial plan to cut the cash ISA allowance has been paused. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that the push could backfire if not handled carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new generation of modern, private members-only clubs is emerging in India, catering to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creatives. These clubs, such as Soho House, offer a more relaxed and contemporary alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which have long waiting lists and cater to old-money elites. While still exclusive and expensive, the new clubs focus on personal accomplishment and community building rather than family legacy. This trend reflects the significant economic and demographic shifts occurring in India's booming, tech-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Veteran guard Marcus Smart intends to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. The deal is reportedly for two years and $11 million, with a player option for the second year. Smart, the 2022 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is expected to provide much-needed perimeter defense for the Lakers. The 31-year-old guard, who spent most of his career with the Boston Celtics, will bring toughness and experience to a Lakers team looking to contend in the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who played for the Clippers for six seasons and ushered in the "Lob City" era, would add depth to the team's backcourt alongside James Harden and newly signed Bradley Beal. At 40 years old, Paul played in all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs last season. The move would align with the team's strategy to enhance its ball-handling and playmaking capabilities.</p>

          <p>Germany advanced to the Euro 2025 semifinals after a dramatic 6-5 penalty shootout victory over France, following a 1-1 draw after extra time.

Berger, who has twice overcome thyroid cancer, made several crucial saves throughout the match, continuing her reputation as a penalty specialist.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy shot a four-under-par 66 in the third round of The Open, keeping his hopes for a victory alive despite being six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler. His round was filled with drama, including a bizarre moment when his shot dislodged another golf ball buried in the rough, leading to a bogey. He quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole, creating one of the loudest roars of the tournament. Despite the deficit, McIlroy feels he has given himself an outside chance for a final-day charge.</p>
