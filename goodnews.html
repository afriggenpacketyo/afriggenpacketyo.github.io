          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for France to manufacture cutting-edge chips, positioning the country as a key tech hub in Europe amidst concerns over reliance on foreign tech firms. Macron highlighted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France, emphasizing the potential for France to produce semiconductors in the 2nm to 10nm range. Macron is advocating for partnerships with companies like TSMC or Samsung to establish local factories. He also mentioned a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France, aiming to convince them to locate manufacturing in France. This initiative aligns with France's broader AI infrastructure buildout, supported by significant private investments.</p>

          <p>Viktor Gyokeres, formerly of Brighton, has become a sought-after player after scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting. Despite Rio Ferdinand's doubts about his suitability for the Premier League, top clubs like Arsenal and Juventus are reportedly interested. Sporting's president denies receiving offers and insists Gyokeres won't leave for the rumored ¬£59m 'gentleman's agreement.' Gyokeres's success in Portugal's Primeira Liga and Champions League has raised questions about his ability to replicate that form in the Premier League, where physicality is a key factor.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, Chinese companies are actively expanding into the U.S. market, exemplified by camera company Insta360's successful Shanghai listing, with the U.S. accounting for a significant portion of its revenue. The trend reflects a broader push for global expansion among Chinese firms, driven by slowing growth at home and a desire to build international brands. Companies like battery giant CATL and robotic vacuum cleaner maker Roborock are also increasing their global presence. This expansion involves establishing offices in different regions and hiring local employees, marking a shift from manufacturing for foreign brands to building independent international brands.</p>

          <p>China is entering the mass production of high-performance photonic chips, which could position the country for advancements in AI, 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's CHIPX has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, using light instead of electrical signals for data transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is showing gains in technical performance. The TFLN material offers ultra-fast electro-optic effects, high bandwidth, and low power consumption, overcoming previous manufacturing challenges. This development marks a significant step for China in the competitive landscape of advanced technology.</p>
