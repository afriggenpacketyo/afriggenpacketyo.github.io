          <p>Kinloch Castle, a monument to Victorian grandeur on Scotland's Isle of Rum, is back on the market for offers over £750,000 after a previous sale collapsed. Owned by NatureScot, the vacant castle is in disrepair, prompting calls for its redevelopment. Islanders and NatureScot emphasize the need for a buyer committed to contributing to the community and nature on the island, with conditions proposed for active community involvement and adherence to land access rights. This rare opportunity seeks to restore a building of historical and cultural importance while supporting the local population of about 40 people.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) deflected questions about a potential 2026 gubernatorial bid, stating his focus remains on promoting a November special election to redraw California’s congressional districts. This redistricting effort, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to counter Republican attempts to maintain control of Congress. Padilla emphasized that the initiative is crucial for preventing the "rigging of the system" and protecting programs like Medicare. While acknowledging his long history of public service in California, he continues to prioritize the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and high interest rates, Edmunds has highlighted five common and costly mistakes car buyers should avoid. The article advises against buying beyond one's financial means, securing loans solely through dealerships, and trading in vehicles with negative equity, which can perpetuate debt. It also recommends leveraging internet sales teams for better deals and considering certified pre-owned options to mitigate rapid depreciation. By avoiding these pitfalls, consumers can make more informed decisions, save thousands, and ensure better long-term financial security in what is often one of their largest purchases after a home.

          <p>With a September Federal Reserve interest rate cut nearly 90% likely, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts need to act strategically. While lower rates will benefit borrowers, they will reduce future CD earnings. The article advises shopping online for the highest rates, as online banks often offer better returns due to lower overhead costs. Savers should also carefully determine their deposit amount to avoid early withdrawal penalties and consider longer-term CDs to maximize returns and protect principal from economic volatility. Proactive planning is key to optimizing CD investments before rates decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking additional financing may find a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) particularly advantageous this September, given favorable market conditions. HELOCs currently offer lower interest rates compared to home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, with potential tax deductibility for eligible home projects. With a Federal Reserve rate cut highly anticipated, HELOC rates, which are variable, could become even cheaper. Furthermore, record-high home equity levels provide a substantial funding source.
