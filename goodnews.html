          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a tight qualifying session, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, continuing a strong showing for the McLaren team at Silverstone. Mercedes' George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finished fourth and fifth, respectively, in a session marked by shifting winds and strategic adjustments. Verstappen noted that the team's low-downforce setup made the car challenging to handle in the high-speed corners but ultimately proved successful.</p>

          <p>Recent reports suggest the relationship between golf legend Tiger Woods and Vanessa Trump, the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr., has become increasingly serious. A source cited by Page Six indicated that the couple, who publicly confirmed their relationship in March, could be heading towards marriage. The two have been connected through their children, Charlie Woods and Kai Trump, who are both competitive junior golfers. This relationship follows Woods' highly publicized divorce from Elin Nordegren and a subsequent public breakup with Erica Herman, marking a new chapter in his personal life.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of digital payment systems has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in a growing number of service situations, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. These systems often present pre-calculated options of 15% or higher, creating social pressure and confusion for consumers. Experts note that while this technology can increase income for service workers, it also benefits the payment companies. This shift has left many people unsure about modern tipping etiquette and feeling pressured into giving gratuities in situations where they previously would not have.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally issued what it described as a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations on the implementation details, though it continues to insist on guarantees for a permanent end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal. President Trump commented that the response was positive and expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon. The development marks a potentially significant step forward in efforts to halt the nearly 21-month-long conflict.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the mix of coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium, and salt can lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Doctors explain that while the individual ingredients are generally harmless and the drink can aid hydration, they are not known to directly impact cortisol levels. They caution that for most people, stress management is better achieved through proven methods like quality sleep, exercise, and maintaining social connections, not a viral drink.</p>

          <p>Scholars are celebrating the rediscovery of the only prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s. The long-lost machine, found in a New York basement, is considered a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing. Its innovative design, which broke down complex characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed on computers today. The typewriter represents a successful effort to integrate a non-alphabetic language into modern technology, preserving cultural identity in the digital age.</p>

          <p>After a swimming ban that lasted more than 100 years due to pollution, Parisians are once again taking a plunge in the Seine River. The reopening of designated swimming areas follows a $1.5 billion cleanup project tied to the city's Olympic preparations, which has successfully brought water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, residents lined up to swim in newly opened zones near the Eiffel Tower and Île Saint-Louis. The event marks the fulfillment of a long-held dream for the city, first championed by former mayor Jacques Chirac in 1988.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington state's Willapa Bay to gain insights into the broader health of the marine ecosystem. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the research involves capturing sharks, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet and water quality, and then releasing them. Beyond the scientific goals, the lab's mission includes changing the public's negative perception of sharks. Researchers hope that by highlighting the crucial role these predators play, they can generate more support for their conservation and the health of the oceans.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man is raising awareness about illegal rental practices after being fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews. His lease contained a "non-disparagement" clause that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less, a practice that violates the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act. This law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future contracts, but the incident highlights a broader issue of companies attempting to silence customers.</p>

          <h2>Researcher Promotes '90-Second Rule' as a Tool for Managing Emotional Responses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage emotional responses to stressful or angering situations. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological effects of anger hormones like cortisol and adrenaline dissipate from the body in about 90 seconds. After this brief period, any lingering feeling is sustained by replaying the thought. Gawdat suggests that by recognizing this, individuals can use the moment after the initial 90 seconds to consciously choose a more constructive response rather than remaining stuck in a cycle of anger.</p>
