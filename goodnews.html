          <h2>Dodgers Consider Utilizing Ohtani as Playoff Relief Pitcher</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 22:57:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dodgers are contemplating using Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher in the playoffs, despite plans for him to be a starting pitcher, according to team president Andrew Friedman. This decision hinges on unforeseen circumstances and the team's needs during a long postseason run, similar to how Walker Buehler was utilized in the past. Logistical challenges arise from Ohtani's two-way status, including warming up and the rule that the Dodgers would lose him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound as a reliever. Friedman expressed frustration with the two-way rule, suggesting changes for relief appearances, but emphasized the focus remains on navigating the regular season first, with Ohtani currently scheduled to start in Game 1 of a potential wild card series. The team will continue to assess the situation, leaving the bullpen possibility open depending on various factors, as the Dodgers weigh the complex pros and cons of how to use Ohtani's arm in October. The game's score may depend on this decision. Optimism is present given the team's strategic thinking and Ohtani's proven capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a "framework" deal for TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping expected to finalize the terms. This framework may lead to U.S.-controlled ownership of the platform, but TikTok has yet to respond to requests for comment. China's lead trade negotiator confirmed the deal and urged the U.S. to cease suppressing Chinese companies. This agreement comes amid ongoing trade discussions and a looming deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business, or face a potential shutdown in the country. The optimism in the market is relatively high given the two countries' willingness to reach an agreement.</p>

          <p>Baker Mayfield led a game-winning drive, capped by Rachaad White's touchdown, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rallied to defeat the Houston Texans 20-19. Mayfield threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns, including a crucial scramble on fourth-and-10 to keep the final drive alive. The Texans, led by CJ Stroud, had taken the lead late in the game, but failed to convert a two-point conversion. The game featured multiple lead changes and a blocked punt, highlighting the competitive nature of the contest. The Buccaneers' ability to execute in the final moments secured the victory and improved their record to 2-0.</p>

South Korea's Kospi also reached a record high after the government reversed its plan to increase capital gains tax on stocks.

          <p>California may become the latest U.S. state to designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official state holiday, with the state Legislature passing Assembly Bill 268. The bill would allow community colleges and public schools to close on Diwali, and state employees could elect to take the day off. Diwali, traditionally celebrated after the year's last harvest, involves honoring the goddess Lakshmi and recognizing important relationships. If passed, the bill would further recognize the Hindu and South Asian communities in California, which has the nation’s largest South Asian population, allowing future generations to feel more integrated into society.</p>

The island faces a backlog of US$21.54 billion across 18 active arms orders, with nearly US$4.5 billion worth of systems in the process of being delivered. The longest delay is for the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon, with delivery pushed back to 2026 due to production and testing bottlenecks.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of a key vote on interest rates. The court upheld an earlier decision that Cook's firing would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, designed to insulate the central bank from political pressure. The decision comes before the Fed's rate-setting committee is expected to vote on lowering its benchmark interest rate for the first time this year, as Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates more aggressively. Ousting Cook would allow Trump to appoint a fourth member to the Fed's governing board, giving his nominees a majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before the central bank's policy committee votes on interest rates. The ruling allows Cook to participate in the pivotal two-day meeting, as Trump's attorneys failed to pause a lower-court ruling barring Cook's firing. Trump moved to fire Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, but Cook sued to block her firing and has denied committing mortgage fraud. The panel of judges sided against Trump's bid for a quick stay, but one judge dissented, stating that they would have granted the president's request. (not investment advice)</p>
