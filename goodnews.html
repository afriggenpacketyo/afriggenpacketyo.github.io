          <p>Stable Recovery, a unique drug and alcohol rehabilitation program, offers men a second chance at life by integrating them into thoroughbred horse care at Kentucky's Taylor Made Farm. Participants live, work, and heal alongside 750 horses, gaining structure and purpose in a free, year-long 12-step program funded entirely by private donors and grants. Co-founders Christian Countzler and Frank Taylor, both in recovery, designed the initiative to address both addiction and a labor shortage in the horse industry. The program boasts a high success rate, with 22 of 25 graduates remaining sober and employed in the horse industry, and is now expanding to include women.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to reduce U.S. drug costs to match lower international prices, hailing it as a significant victory after previous failed attempts to curb pharmaceutical expenses. The agreement includes Pfizer's participation in a new discount website, TrumpRx, primarily benefiting Medicaid patients and applying to new drugs launched at international parity. Industry experts, however, question the immediate widespread impact for all Americans, as patients on TrumpRx would still pay out-of-pocket for potentially expensive prescriptions. Trump leveraged the threat of 100% tariffs on drugmakers not manufacturing in the U.S. to secure this concession, signaling a shift in the pharmaceutical industry's resistance.

          <p>China's economy is undergoing a profound transformation, challenging perceptions of stagnation, driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs and consumers fostering competitiveness and global integration. Unlike their predecessors, this cohort, largely born after the famine era, is technically trained and focused on innovation and co-creation with government and other partners. Many hail from business-savvy provinces like Zhejiang and Guangdong, known for their strong business culture, blending past experiences of scarcity with current market and technological opportunities. This entrepreneurial spirit is key to China's resilience, driving significant restructuring and continued integration into global systems, according to a recent opinion article.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace Football Club has achieved a new club record, extending their unbeaten run to 19 games and securing their first away victory in Europe against Dynamo Kyiv in the Conference League. Just a year ago, the Eagles were struggling at 18th in the Premier League, but under manager Oliver Glasner, they now sit third in the top flight with an unbeaten record of three wins and three draws. This remarkable turnaround, which included ending leaders Liverpool's 100% start, is attributed to the team's hunger and ambition. Their consistent performance marks a significant period of growth and achievement in the club's 120-year history.</p>

          <p>Treasure hunters off Florida's "treasure coast" have discovered an estimated $1 million in silver and gold coins from a Spanish fleet wrecked by a hurricane on July 31, 1715.

This rare and extraordinary find provides a tangible link to the people who lived, worked, and sailed during the Spanish empire's golden age.

          <p>CBS News Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo publicly shared her 10-month private battle with early-stage breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, aiming to inspire others. Her diagnosis, caught at Stage One, was a result of her persistence in requesting an ultrasound for her right breast after a self-exam, despite the initial prescription only being for her left side. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and 15 days of radiation, and is now feeling great, remaining on medication for five years. Her experience underscores the importance of self-advocacy and early detection in fighting the disease, with CBS Miami partnering on free mammogram events.</p>

          <p>Prince William's interview with actor Eugene Levy offered an unprecedentedly open glimpse into his vision for the monarchy and personal life. He expressed a clear intent for "change for good" when he becomes king, aiming to avoid being "suffocated" by history while maintaining crucial traditions. The conversation also revealed personal details, like his use of an electric scooter at Windsor Castle and his children's favorite activities, and touched upon the "overwhelmed" feeling he experienced due to his wife's and father's illnesses. This informal setting provided a unique platform for the heir to the throne to share his thoughts on family, public role, and future plans for the institution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 17:01:55 EDT</div>

          <p>Lucumí, also known as Santería, is an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, developed by enslaved Africans in Cuba as an act of resistance and survival. Scholars are actively working to destigmatize the religion, emphasizing its focus on health, well-being, balance, and connection to nature and ancestors, rather than mischaracterizations as "witchcraft." Despite a 1993 Supreme Court ruling protecting animal sacrifice as part of the practice, discrimination and surveillance persist due to historical vilification used to justify enslavement and forced conversion. Practitioners, like Francisco Álvarez León, find grounding and positive energy in Lucumí, which prioritizes good character and aligning with one's destiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the FICO credit score, saw its shares surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to bypass credit bureaus for direct score licensing. This move aims to eliminate "unnecessary mark-ups" and give lenders more choice, potentially improving FICO's economics. Shares of credit bureaus Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax fell significantly in response, as the change could lessen their importance in mortgage lending. FHFA Director Bill Pulte, who previously criticized FICO's "monopoly," praised the initiative as a step towards creative solutions for consumers and fostering market competition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats are employing various, often under-the-radar, strategies to resist the Trump administration's agenda, despite their base perceiving them as "weak" and "ineffective." These tactics include using Senate procedural powers like filibusters, roll call votes, and blanket "holds" to delay legislation and nominations, and House discharge petitions to force votes on unpopular issues. While congressional efforts are limited without a majority, the most effective resistance is occurring outside Congress through numerous Democratic lawsuits that have successfully blocked or delayed many administration actions. This dynamic highlights a disconnect between the visible political theater and the actual mechanisms of opposition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 16:19:19 EDT</div>

          <p>OpenAI has finalized a $6.6 billion secondary share sale, valuing the company at a record $500 billion, allowing current and former employees to cash out their stock. Investors in this round include Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The high valuation, up from $300 billion earlier this year, and lower-than-authorized participation are seen internally as a vote of confidence in OpenAI's long-term prospects. This marks OpenAI's second major tender offer in less than a year, cementing its status as the world's most valuable privately held company and reflecting intense competition for AI talent.
