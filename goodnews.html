          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported delivering over 34,000 cars in June, marking its eighth consecutive month of strong sales despite a fierce price war in the country. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other premium competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed or modest results. The intense competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, puts pressure on international players like Tesla, whose sales in China are projected to decline. Meanwhile, newcomers like Xiaomi are gaining traction with aggressive pricing, further complicating the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. The deal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would create a window to negotiate a permanent end to the conflict. This development comes ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, it remains unclear if Hamas will agree to the terms, as the group has previously demanded a permanent truce and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel insists on dismantling Hamas completely.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision blocks a plan by the Department of Homeland Security to end the program in September, well before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge stated that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before the existing extension period ends. This ruling provides temporary relief for Haitians who rely on the status for legal residency and work permits, though the White House has announced it will appeal.</p>
