          <p>The Stanley Cup final between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers has taken on political undertones, fueled by Trump's strained relationship with Canada and other factors. Wayne Gretzky's support for Trump and a Panthers minority owner's controversial remarks have added to the tension. The Panthers' brash attitude and association with the "Florida Man" persona further contribute to the rivalry. An Oilers win would be particularly satisfying for many Canadians given the current political climate, and it is clear that the stakes are high on and off the ice.</p>

          <p>WorldPride, held in Washington, D.C. this year, faces lower attendance and sponsorship compared to the 2019 New York City event, due to the Trump administration's policies and rhetoric concerning trans people and DEI initiatives. Some companies declined to sponsor the event, and international choirs opted out of participating in the choral festival. Organizers moved events from the Kennedy Center in response to the administration's takeover. Despite these challenges, the festival includes numerous events, such as concerts and a human rights conference, with organizers emphasizing a "fighting mode" to address threats to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has proposed a significant increase in defense spending, citing the need for the U.K. to be prepared for potential conflict in Europe due to the threat posed by Russia. The plan includes modernizing the military, developing a hybrid navy, and increasing long-range weapons capabilities. Experts suggest that uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's approach to NATO is also a factor driving this shift in defense posture. If approved, the plan would increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with a goal of reaching 3% in the future.</p>

Authorities warned residents of fines for refusing to evacuate, emphasizing the danger posed by the bombs.

          <h2>Tesla's Australian Sales Surge in May Amid Global Struggles</h2>

          <p>Tesla experienced a rebound in Australian sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. While sales in the U.S. and Europe have declined, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with Model Y sales soaring 122.5% year-over-year. Despite this rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. Experts suggest that while the Australian rebound is positive, it does not necessarily signal a broader global recovery for Tesla.</p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, described as one of the largest in the city's history, led to the closure of roads, hotels, and train stations. The bombs, remnants of Allied attacks during the war, were discovered in the Deutz district. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to its status as a major bombing target during World War II, with authorities taking extensive measures to ensure public safety during the operation.</p>
