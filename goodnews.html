          <p>A sequel to the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada" is officially in production, with a planned release in May. The original main cast, including Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci, are all set to reprise their roles, alongside director David Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna. New cast members include Kenneth Branagh, Lucy Liu, and Justin Theroux, though Adrian Grenier, who played the controversial boyfriend Nate, will not be returning. While the plot is largely secret, it will reportedly follow Miranda Priestly navigating a struggling magazine industry nearly a decade after the original film's events.</p>

          <p>Joe Locke, star of the hit Netflix series "Heartstopper," is set to make his West End debut this autumn in the play "Clarkston." Written by Samuel D. Hunter, the acclaimed playwright behind "The Whale," the story follows two young men from different backgrounds who form a bond while working night shifts at a Costco in a small Washington town. Locke will portray Jake, a young gay man with Huntington's disease, a role he says aligns with his interest in playing complex, flawed characters. The production explores themes of class, friendship, and platonic male love, and follows Locke's successful stage appearances on Broadway and at London's Donmar Warehouse.</p>

This new hardware can be integrated into existing data centers, allowing AWS to deploy dense computing clusters like Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 more efficiently.
