          <p>President Trump has ordered significant reductions to the White House National Security Council, dismissing numerous policy experts, aiming to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication by shifting operations back to their original departments. The NSC will be reduced to approximately the same size as at the end of Trump's first term, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio running the NSC in an unusual double role after the previous advisor was nominated as ambassador to the United Nations. The overhaul is intended to streamline the NSC, which Trump has viewed with distrust since his first term, believing it undermined his policy views. The cuts were catalyzed by an op-ed arguing for consolidation, aligning with Trump's preference for top-down foreign policy decision-making.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are evolving due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The birds' beaks have grown longer and more slender to better access nectar, and males' beaks have become pointier for fighting off competition at feeders. This has also led to the expansion of the hummingbird's range northward, chasing the growing popularity of bird feeders. Researchers analyzed newspaper archives, census data, bird counts, and museum specimens to demonstrate the physical changes in the birds over approximately 10 generations.</p>

          <p>A US judge has overturned Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed a lawyer who investigated him. The executive order, called Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block, suspended security clearances for the firm‚Äôs lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings, officials and federal contracting work. Judge John D Bates ruled that Trump‚Äôs directive violated core rights under the US constitution, mirroring a similar ruling against law firm Perkins Coie. The judge said the order ‚Äúmakes no bones about why it chose its target: it picked Jenner because of the causes Jenner champions, the clients Jenner represents, and a lawyer Jenner once employed‚Äù.</p>

          <p>A federal judge halted the Trump administration's attempt to block international students from attending Harvard University, granting a temporary restraining order. Harvard sued the administration after the Department of Homeland Security revoked the university's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, halting its ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit accused the Trump administration of a "campaign of retribution" against the university, arguing the action threatened the futures of thousands of students and scholars.</p>
