          <p>American fund managers are urging Congress to revise Section 899 of President Trump's tax bill, fearing it could trigger a rapid withdrawal of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests the bill could lead to capital outflows and depress U.S. equity markets, harming both companies and investors, and it is pushing for clarification to avoid discouraging foreign investment through investment funds. The Senate Finance Committee has so far declined to comment on the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 2026 calendar will feature a Madrid Grand Prix, marking its debut as the second race in Spain, while Imola will be dropped from the schedule. Imola's removal is due to the pressure on the number of events, with F1 aiming for an ideal number of 24 races. Zandvoort is also hosting its last race next year, and Spa will have a contract from 2026 to host only four races in six years. F1 is also considering races in Thailand and Africa, with potential venues in Bangkok and Morocco.</p>

          <p>China's Ping An Bank is using Pop Mart's popular Labubu dolls as an incentive to attract young customers amid fierce competition in the retail banking sector. New clients who open a savings account and deposit over 50,000 yuan for at least three months can receive a Labubu blind box. This marketing campaign, which quickly went viral on RedNote, highlights the challenges Chinese retail banks face in attracting and retaining young customers due to low interest rates and a declining customer base.</p>

          <p>Japan is setting a goal to reduce the estimated death toll from a potential megaquake in the Nankai Trough by around 80 percent over the next decade. The government also aims to halve the maximum number of buildings expected to be completely destroyed in the quake. This revised plan emphasizes rigorous monitoring of progress and urges local governments to update their local measures, including releasing hazard maps and conducting evacuation drills. The government's previous plan had inadequate progress in disaster preparedness, underscoring the need for enhanced efforts.</p>

          <p>Some investors in Toyota Industries are voicing disapproval of a $33 billion buyout offer from Toyota Motor, joining international shareholders who believe the bid undervalues the supplier. Shareholders at the company's annual general meeting expressed concerns that the offer price of 16,300 yen a share is too low and strengthens the founding Toyoda family's control. Toyota has said the acquisition would allow Toyota Industries to deepen collaboration with group companies, without concerns of short-term profit targets. One shareholder said the acquisition would lead to the "domination" of Toyota Industries, one of Toyota's key suppliers, by the automaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Regulators from multiple countries, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), have joined forces for an international crackdown on rogue financial promotions by social media influencers. The FCA has issued numerous warning alerts, cease and desist letters, and made arrests in the UK, targeting unauthorized "finfluencers" promoting financial products illegally. This action aims to protect social media users from misleading or harmful financial advice. The Treasury Committee has also requested information from Meta on its approach to financial influencers, reflecting concerns about the platforms' role in enabling these promotions.

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to curb elevated prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, raising concerns about emergency preparedness. The government suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of price hikes, prompting efforts to stabilize domestic supply.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased by double-digit percentages, offsetting losses from high US tariffs. Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factories in Southeast Asia for local sale or re-export, including to the U.S. Analysts note that factories often inject enough local content into goods from China to declare any re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>
