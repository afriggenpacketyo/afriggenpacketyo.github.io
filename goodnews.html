          <p>China is experiencing a significant increase in foreign visitors following the implementation of new visa-free travel policies. In the first half of 2025, foreign nationals made 38 million trips into and out of the country, marking a 30% year-on-year increase. The National Immigration Administration credits these measures with effectively attracting tourists and business travelers, which in turn is driving substantial growth in inbound consumption. This policy expands on previous, more restrictive transit visa programs, signaling a broader opening to international travel and economic exchange.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Indonesia have reached a new trade agreement, reducing tariffs on Indonesian goods from a proposed 32% down to 19%. In exchange, President Trump stated that American firms would gain "full access" to Indonesian markets. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto described the deal as a "new era of mutual benefit," though a tough negotiation. As part of the pact, Indonesia has reportedly agreed to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets, marking another development in the administration's ongoing global trade talks.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims. The ad suggested the beverage, which contains magnesium and other supplements, could help consumers feel calm and reduce stress and anxiety. The watchdog found these claims were not compliant with regulations for marketing health benefits in food and drink products. The ASA also ruled that the company's "0g added sugar" claim was inaccurate, and ordered that the ad must not appear again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Bank of America is expected to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts forecasting positive results driven by key tailwinds. Wall Street anticipates a rise in net interest income (NII), which measures the profitability of bank lending, potentially marking an inflection point for the second half of the year. Additionally, trading revenues are projected to climb, benefiting from market activity. While the company had guided for a decline in investment banking fees, strong performance from rivals suggests a potential upside for Bank of America as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NHS nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct allegations after she complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities at a hospital. An internal hearing by NHS Fife found insufficient evidence to support a finding of misconduct against the nurse. The decision was announced as a separate employment tribunal, brought by Ms. Peggie against the health board, resumed proceedings.</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blackstone has been significantly increasing its investment in the U.S. rental housing market, acquiring billions of dollars' worth of properties. The company's portfolio includes apartment complexes, student housing, and single-family rentals, with a focus on major cities and Sun Belt states experiencing high job and population growth. Blackstone states it follows these demographic trends and currently owns less than 1% of the nation's 46 million rental homes. Analysts note that buying existing properties remains cheaper than building new ones, supporting rent growth and making such acquisitions a strategic move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deacon in Wayne, Michigan, is being praised for his heroic actions in stopping a potential mass shooting at his church. Richard Pryor saw a man armed with a rifle begin firing in the church parking lot and made the split-second decision to ram the attacker with his pickup truck. This intervention temporarily disabled the shooter, giving the church's armed security team time to respond and fatally shoot the assailant. Over 100 congregants, including many children, were inside at the time, and Pryor's courage is credited with preventing a major tragedy.</p>

          <p>A new messaging app called Bitchat, developed by a team including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, allows users to communicate without an internet or cellular connection. The app functions by creating a decentralized mesh network, using Bluetooth to send encrypted messages directly between nearby devices. This technology enables communication in areas with poor connectivity, during network outages, or in regions with internet censorship. Bitchat is currently in an early testing phase but aims to provide a secure, private, and server-free alternative to traditional messaging platforms.</p>

          <p>While cognitive functions like memory and processing speed naturally decline after age 40, research suggests that lifestyle choices can significantly preserve brain health. A large-scale study called MindCrowd identified that "exceptional" brain performers often share key habits, including getting high-quality sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health. Experts emphasize that controlling vascular risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol can result in a younger-looking and better-functioning brain. Other crucial measures include regular exercise, limiting alcohol, and avoiding smoking to help mitigate age-related cognitive decline.</p>

Nvidia's stock received another boost after the U.S. government approved the sale of some of its AI chips to China, a significant development in the tech trade landscape. The achievement highlights Nvidia's central role in the AI revolution and raises the stakes for competition in the rapidly growing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite significant interest among young Germans in starting their own companies, few actually do, pointing to a large amount of untapped entrepreneurial potential. A recent survey found that while 40% of 14-to-25-year-olds are interested in entrepreneurship, the primary barriers are financial insecurity, lack of networks, and limited access to capital. Experts and successful young founders suggest that solutions like basic income security during the initial startup phase, mentorship programs, and better integration of entrepreneurship into school curricula could help foster a more robust startup culture in Germany beyond its major tech hubs.</p>

This financial blow targets the infrastructure of one of the drug trafficking organizations designated as a global terrorist group by the Trump administration.
