          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to professional rugby union. After spending 18 months in the NFL's International Player Pathway Program and being part of the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, the 24-year-old winger stated it was time to come home. He announced his departure from rugby in January 2024 to chase his American football dream. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for the Welsh national team, which recently ended a long losing streak under new head coach Steve Tandy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo has reported a more than doubling of its revenue for the fiscal first quarter, largely driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company announced that sales of the new device have already reached 5.82 million units since its release in early June. Quarterly revenue hit 572.3 billion yen, a 132% increase year-over-year and well above analyst expectations. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its full-year financial forecast, a target some analysts consider conservative given the new console's powerful sales momentum.

          <p>Germany's wolf population has grown significantly, leading officials to report a "favorable" conservation status for the species in the country's northern Atlantic region for the first time. With an estimated 1,600 wolves in 209 packs, the government is now planning to allow hunting in these areas, a move that has drawn criticism from farmers' associations seeking more urgent action. In other German news, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting the West Bank to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas amid rising tensions. The minister previously warned Israel of growing international isolation over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 03:14:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reforming its main civil service internship program to exclusively admit university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has been criticized by the Conservative opposition as "leftist social engineering," but the government argues it is necessary to harness a broader range of talent and improve decision-making.</p>

Burgin, once a record-breaking junior athlete, is now focused on securing a top-two finish at the UK Athletics Championships to qualify for the world event.

          <p>A new UK law banning the manufacture, sale, and possession of ninja swords, named 'Ronan's Law,' has come into effect. The law is named after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda, who was fatally stabbed with such a weapon in 2022 in a case of mistaken identity. His mother, Pooja Kanda, who campaigned relentlessly for the legislation, called it a bittersweet moment, believing it will save lives but came too late for her son. The law also mandates that retailers report suspicious knife orders and conduct strict age verification, aiming to curb the accessibility of dangerous weapons to young people.</p>

          <h2>South African Scientists Use Radioactive Isotopes in Rhino Horns to Combat Poaching</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in South Africa have launched a novel anti-poaching initiative called the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive material. This collaborative effort between the University of the Witwatersrand and conservationists aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at international borders and airports. The goal is to deter poaching and disrupt trafficking networks by increasing the risk of arrest for smugglers. Following successful trials, five rhinos were injected at the project's official launch, with researchers confirming the process is safe for the animals but effective for detection.</p>

Joseph Paintsil was the standout performer for the Galaxy, scoring two goals and creating another, bouncing back after having a penalty saved in the first half. Matheus Nascimento, Gabriel Pec, and Marco Reus also scored for the MLS team. Tijuana's two goals both came from young player Gilberto Mora, who provided the main challenge for the Galaxy's defense. The win provides a much-needed positive result for the LA Galaxy, who have been struggling in their domestic league campaign.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests a shift in the space industry's ambitions, with Mars increasingly viewed as the ultimate destination rather than the Moon. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration, many ventures now frame moon missions as a "stepping stone" for future human expeditions to the red planet. The new space race to Mars involves a broader set of players, including China and the European Space Agency, alongside the U.S. The article notes that as national agencies pivot towards Mars, lunar projects may increasingly become the domain of private companies, which are already playing a key role in delivering payloads to the Moon.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait are strengthening their military ties, highlighted by the imminent opening of a joint ammunition factory. At an event marking the founding of China's People's Liberation Army, Kuwait's deputy minister of defence called the factory a "milestone" in their cooperation. The two nations also pledged to expand joint military training programs, which have been ongoing since 2019. This deepening relationship comes as Beijing continues to increase its engagement and influence in the Gulf region. Kuwait was the first Gulf state to sign a military cooperation agreement with China back in 1995.</p>
