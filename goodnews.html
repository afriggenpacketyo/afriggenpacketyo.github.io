          <p>A federal judge issued an injunction against President Trump's executive order aimed at eliminating the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the primary source of federal funding for public libraries. The judge stated that the order violated the Administrative Procedure Act and disregarded the constitutional role of Congress in appropriating funds. This article emphasizes the importance of the IMLS, which supports small and rural libraries, and notes the legal challenges President Trump faces from organizations like the American Library Association and AFSCME, who also oppose the dismantling of IMLS.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the Trump administration's efforts to shift the focus away from the nation's racial past, highlighting the resistance from institutions dedicated to preserving Black history. It details how the administration's executive order denouncing cultural institutions attempting to "rewrite our Nation's history" has created uncertainty for sites like the Whitney Plantation. The article notes that the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture is pushing back against the order, and the article underscores the challenges of reversing decades of reckoning with the nation's racist history. The article also highlights the importance of historical sites dedicated to Black history in shaping a more inclusive American narrative.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes, containing traces of DMT and tobacco at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found indicates that only select members of Chav√≠n society participated in these rituals. This article sheds light on the use of hallucinogens in ancient cultures and their potential role in shaping social structures.</p>
