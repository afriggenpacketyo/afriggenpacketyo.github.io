          <p>Irish cyclist Ben Healy achieved his first Tour de France stage win with a remarkable solo breakaway. He attacked from an eight-man group with 42km remaining and finished nearly three minutes ahead of his closest competitors. Meanwhile, Mathieu van der Poel finished far enough ahead of the main peloton to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey from Tadej Pogacar by a single second. Healy, who had a strong debut last year, mentioned that he had specifically targeted this hilly stage for a potential victory, crediting his success to immense hard work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has granted a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their infants. The judge determined that the challengers were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was enforced. This decision is significant as it utilizes the class-action pathway for relief, a method left open after the Supreme Court recently limited the scope of nationwide injunctions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates near all-time highs, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a financial solution. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed. The article suggests this can be a viable option for those whose interest payments are outpacing their principal reduction or who face high penalty APRs. While it can offer substantial savings, consumers should be aware of the potential negative impact on their credit score and any associated fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first-ever Hermès Birkin bag, created for singer and actress Jane Birkin in 1985, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction in Paris for €8.6 million (£7.4 million). This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction, following an intense 10-minute bidding war. The iconic black leather bag originated from a chance encounter on a flight where Birkin discussed the need for a more practical luxury bag with the head of Hermès. The prototype features unique details, including Birkin's initials and marks from where she placed stickers.</p>

This phenomenon is part of a larger cultural shift where consumption and brand affiliation have become central to expressing personal identity and values. An anthropologist who studies fandom notes that these stores successfully tap into regional, social, and even moral identities, turning the act of grocery shopping into a form of tribal signaling. For many, where they buy their food says something profound about who they are.</p>

The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag closely resembles that of the United States.
