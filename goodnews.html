          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has expressed skepticism regarding Marcus Rashford's assertion that an "inconsistent environment" was responsible for his fluctuating performance at the club. Rashford, who scored 30 goals in 2022-23 but has since struggled and is now on loan at Barcelona, recently attributed his form to the club's environment. Rooney argued that while the environment might not have been ideal, a player's application and effort are ultimately their own responsibility. This article presents Rooney's perspective, suggesting that blaming external factors might be an easy way out for a player capable of more.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union heads of state are poised to demand quicker action on utilizing immobilized Russian assets, particularly the profits generated from them, to finance Ukraine's pressing military and defense needs. A draft document reveals a call for the European Commission to swiftly present concrete proposals on leveraging these cash balances, estimated at around 175 billion euros. This initiative gains momentum amid pressure from the U.S. President Donald Trump, although some member states, notably Belgium, express concerns about potential financial and legal repercussions once the conflict concludes. The article emphasizes the EU's commitment to robustly supporting Kyiv, navigating complex legal frameworks to ensure both aid delivery and investor confidence in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>
