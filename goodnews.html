          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of history's greatest companies, stating that investing in its stock would be a very smart decision. His comments came during a visit to Taiwan and in response to questions about the U.S. government potentially acquiring equity stakes in chip companies receiving CHIPS Act funding. Huang confirmed that TSMC is manufacturing six new products for Nvidia, including its next-generation Rubin AI chip platform. The discussion follows reports that the U.S. Commerce Secretary was exploring such stakes, although a subsequent report indicated no current plans to do so. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Thai court has acquitted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of a royal defamation charge, a verdict that spares him a potential 15-year prison sentence. The case, originally filed in 2016 while he was in exile, concerned remarks made in a 2015 interview. The court found the evidence presented by the prosecution to be weak and incomplete, noting that witnesses may have been politically biased against him. This acquittal provides some relief for the influential Shinawatra family, as Thaksin's daughter, suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, faces a separate court ruling that could remove her from office.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has hinted at the imminent arrival of next-generation homegrown AI chips in China, announcing that its latest language model, V3.1, includes a precision format tailored for these unreleased domestic processors. This development suggests a strategic move to align with Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency amid stringent U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors. The company, which previously gained attention for developing powerful AI models despite restrictions on accessing top-tier Nvidia chips, did not specify which domestic chips its new model would support. The announcement comes as China encourages its tech firms to prioritize local hardware alternatives.</p>

The National Hurricane Center has warned that swimming conditions will likely remain hazardous for several more days along many East Coast beaches. As of Friday morning, Erin was a Category 1 storm located hundreds of miles off the coast and was forecast to pass south of Atlantic Canada before becoming a post-tropical system. Although direct impact on the U.S. has diminished, the storm previously caused coastal flooding in parts of North Carolina, Virginia, and New York.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing modest signs of warming up, with sales of existing homes rising 2% in July and the number of homes for sale reaching its highest point in five years. This increase in inventory provides buyers with more options and greater negotiating power, while home prices are softening in many major metropolitan areas. However, the market remains sluggish overall, as high home prices and mortgage rates, currently averaging around 6.6%, continue to challenge affordability for many potential buyers. Economists expect rates to remain near this level for the rest of the year, though a future Federal Reserve rate cut could provide some relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Patients Find Paying Cash for Prenatal Tests Can Be Cheaper Than Using Insurance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of patients are discovering that paying the out-of-pocket cash price for medical services, such as prenatal genetic tests, can be significantly cheaper than using their health insurance. One patient's story highlights this counterintuitive trend: after her insurer was billed over $4,400 by the testing company Natera, she was left with a $750 bill for her deductible. However, after learning of a cash-pay option, she was able to settle the bill directly with the company for a much lower price. This situation reflects a broader issue in the U.S. healthcare system where high list prices for insurers can lead to substantial out-of-pocket costs for patients with high-deductible plans.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have introduced new guidelines to regulate medical science content on social media and other independent online platforms, aiming to curb the spread of false and misleading health information. The rules place stricter requirements on healthcare professionals disseminating medical advice and mandate that platforms take greater responsibility for verifying account credentials and content authenticity. These measures are designed to draw a clear distinction between genuine public health education and disguised commercial advertising. The move addresses the rapid growth of health-related accounts online and seeks to ensure the public receives accurate and reliable medical information.</p>

          <p>A growing trend in the UK sees couples incorporating their pet dogs into their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral members of the family. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, flower girls, and official greeters, reflecting a societal shift where pets are viewed as best friends and sources of emotional support. To accommodate this demand, specialized dog chaperone services have emerged to manage the pets on the big day, handling everything from transport and grooming to practicing their specific roles. For many couples, having their dog present is a non-negotiable part of their celebration, adding a unique and personal touch to the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prolonged and severe summer heatwaves across Europe have led to a massive surge in demand for air conditioners, with China's exports of the units to the continent jumping by nearly 60% in July compared to the previous year. As cities from Madrid to Paris experience record-breaking temperatures, the continent's general lack of preparedness for extreme heat has created a booming market for cooling systems. Chinese brands, which dominate the global market by producing approximately 80% of the world's air conditioners, are the primary beneficiaries of this increased demand. The trend highlights a direct economic consequence of accelerating climate change.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order concerning the removal of stray dogs from the streets of New Delhi, responding to protests from animal rights activists. The new directive specifies that dogs should be caught, sterilized, and immunized before being released, with removal to shelters reserved only for cases involving rabies or aggressive behavior. However, the court has now barred the public feeding of stray dogs, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones instead. The ruling comes amid a reported surge in dog bite incidents in the capital, and the court aims to frame a nationwide policy to address the complex issue.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a major crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after moving abroad, a move expected to save £350 million over five years. A new specialist team of over 200 investigators will use travel data to identify claimants who have been out of the country for more than eight weeks and are no longer eligible. This expansion follows a successful pilot program that stopped £17 million in incorrect payments to 2,600 people in less than a year. The initiative aims to both recover taxpayer money and raise awareness of the rules to prevent mistaken claims.</p>
