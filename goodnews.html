          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh aimed to challenge public perceptions of sharks, which he says have been unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws," and to advocate for their protection. He swam for multiple hours a day in the frigid waters, enduring harsh weather conditions and the mental challenge of being hyper-aware of sharks in the water. Pugh, who has previously swum in extreme environments, emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, highlighting that around 100 million are killed each year.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are optimistic about reaching a quick resolution in the trade war with the US after President Trump delayed threatened tariffs until July 9, following discussions with Ursula von der Leyen. Both parties have agreed to fast-track trade negotiations, with the EU reiterating its "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Despite the positive signals, businesses remain uncertain due to Trump's flip-flopping on border taxes, and existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place. The EU is also considering further retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including targeting tech firms and banks.</p>

          <p>Peter Magyar, Hungary's opposition leader, walked from Budapest to Oradea, Romania, to gain support from ethnic Hungarians in the area, a vital voter group in Hungarian elections. Magyar's walk is part of a broader political strategy to challenge Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been accused of corruption and damaging the country's infrastructure. Magyar aims to address the concerns of Hungarians and present a positive message of unity and reconciliation, contrasting with Orban's divisive rhetoric. The move highlights the importance of ethnic Hungarian voters in neighboring countries and Magyar's efforts to broaden his appeal.</p>

          <p>European stock markets closed higher after President Trump announced a delay in implementing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally ended up 1%, with all sectors in positive territory, with the French CAC 40 and Germany's DAX also seeing gains. Automakers, particularly sensitive to trade tensions, rebounded, and German carmakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen experienced notable increases. The news boosted investor confidence after Trump's initial threat to impose the tariffs had caused market jitters.</p>
