          <h2>Tesla's Australian Sales Surge in May Amid Global Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 02:37:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching a 12-month high, despite facing declining sales in the U.S. and Europe. The surge was primarily driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, with a 122.5% year-over-year increase. While total deliveries in Australia rose by 9.3% compared to the previous year, they surged over 675% from April. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year, indicating that the Australian rebound does not necessarily signal a broader global recovery. The score reflects the regional success against a backdrop of wider market struggles.</p>

She humorously mentioned her upcoming surgery as a "very dramatic way to get a boob job" and plans to take some time off before returning with new music. The singer, who gave birth to a son in 2023, emphasized the diagnosis has given her a new perspective and sought support from her fans during this time.</p>
