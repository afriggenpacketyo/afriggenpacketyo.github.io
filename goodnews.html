          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon offered by President Trump, stating that she feels guilty and believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative. Hemphill, who was part of the crowd that confronted police at the Capitol, believes that accepting the pardon would be inappropriate and damaging to Americans' views of the federal government. She has worked with Senator James Risch to formally refuse and block the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. This action contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who actively sought copies of their pardons.</p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie, in a recent interview, discussed the growing trend of censorship in America, noting that it comes from both the left and the right. He argues that while censorship is often framed as protecting vulnerable groups, it can ultimately harm minority groups and suppress free expression. Rushdie, who has faced censorship and threats himself, emphasizes the importance of hearing from voices that may offend, as they challenge and provoke thought. He also expresses his wish to be remembered for his lifetime of writing, rather than the threats he has faced.</p>

          <p>A surprising number of Hollywood stars are Australian, and this article explores the reasons behind their success, highlighting the role of institutions like NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), which provides rigorous training. The Australian acting style is characterized by skill, confidence, courage, and a lack of self-indulgence. Australian actors often take their work seriously but do not take themselves too seriously, contributing to a positive and collaborative environment. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from the intense scrutiny of Hollywood, fostering a unique perspective and approach to their craft.</p>

          <p>A strong geomagnetic storm is expected to make the northern lights visible across much of the northern half of the contiguous U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm is being spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt Earth's magnetosphere and cause problems with power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. While the coronal mass ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event. The northern lights are typically best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>
