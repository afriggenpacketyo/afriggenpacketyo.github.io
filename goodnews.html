          <p>An explosion, believed to have originated in the boiler room, caused a partial collapse of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx. The blast tore away a ventilation shaft, sending debris onto the street below, but remarkably, officials reported no injuries or loss of life. Authorities, including Mayor Eric Adams, confirmed that the building's structural integrity is being inspected, and residents from the most affected apartments have been evacuated as a precaution. The Red Cross has established a support center for displaced residents while gas service to the complex has been shut off during the investigation.</p>

          <p>Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning has received a significant endorsement from actor and University of Texas attendee Glen Powell. During an ESPN appearance, Powell predicted Manning would overcome early-season criticism and has the capability to lead the team to a national championship. The "Top Gun: Maverick" star, whose uncles Peyton and Eli Manning are producers on Powell's new series, expressed his belief that Texas could be on the verge of a dynasty run. He noted that Manning appears to be playing more instinctively and is no longer overthinking his performance on the field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in overall U.S. auto sales for the third quarter, largely driven by record-breaking demand for their electric vehicles. This surge in EV sales, which more than doubled for GM, was partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September. Industry analysts expect the quarter to set a new record for EV sales in the U.S., potentially reaching a 10% market share for the first time. GM stated it remains the top automaker in U.S. sales, achieving its highest market share since 2015. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of volunteers in Woodbridge, England, including a former U.S. Navy submariner, is meticulously building a full-scale, seaworthy replica of the famous Sutton Hoo longship. The original 7th-century vessel, believed to be the burial ship of an Anglo-Saxon king, was discovered nearby nearly a century ago. The reconstruction project aims for historical accuracy by using only the tools and methods that would have been available 1,400 years ago, such as hand-forged nails and specially selected oak trees. The ambitious undertaking draws thousands of visitors monthly and highlights a significant period of English history about which little is known.</p>

          <p>Internet and communication services are being restored across Afghanistan following a two-day nationwide shutdown ordered by the Taliban government. The blackout drew widespread condemnation from international bodies like the United Nations, which warned of severe harm to the Afghan people and economy. The restoration was reportedly ordered by the Taliban's prime minister, though no official reason for the shutdown was provided. For many Afghans, especially women and girls whose rights and access to education have been severely curtailed, the internet serves as a crucial lifeline to the outside world and a tool for learning.</p>

          <p>The UK government has mandated that all general practitioner practices in England must provide online appointment booking services throughout the workday to combat the daily "8am scramble" on phone lines. Patients can now use online systems to request appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms for a call back between 8:00 and 18:30 on weekdays. However, the British Medical Association has formally disputed the new system, warning of a potential "online triage tsunami" that could overwhelm practices without proper safeguards. While ministers argue sufficient funding has been provided, some patients report that online portals show no availability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that pharmaceutical company Pfizer has agreed to offer significant discounts on some prescription drugs for all Americans and provide medications to Medicaid at lower prices. The move was motivated by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured abroad, according to Pfizer's CEO. The president stated some drug prices could fall by 50-100%, with all new Pfizer medications being sold at a reduced "most favored nation" cost. The discounted drugs will be available on a new government-operated website to be called "TrumpRx," which is expected to launch in early 2026.</p>

After remodeling her bowling action last year, she has developed the ability to swing the ball both ways, making her a formidable opening bowler.

Some companies, like Prevail Coffee Roasters, are now testing payment apps that allow customers to pay with stablecoins, which promises near-instantaneous settlement and significantly lower transaction fees.
