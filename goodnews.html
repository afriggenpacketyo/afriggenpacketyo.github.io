        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, ending a preemptive ban. The suspension was a response to remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the death of a conservative activist. While Disney's ABC network had already reinstated the show, major affiliate owners like Sinclair and Nexstar had continued to block it. Sinclair stated its decision aims to ensure programming serves community interests while honoring network obligations, noting the show's return would begin immediately. This move comes after the program drew significantly higher viewership on the stations where it did air.</p>

          <p>Shares of video game giant Electronic Arts (EA) surged by 15% following a report that the company is close to a deal to be taken private for approximately $50 billion. The potential leveraged buyout, reportedly involving investors like Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake, could be announced as early as next week. If completed, it would represent the largest leveraged buyout in history, surpassing the 2007 deal for TXU Energy. EA is known for major franchises such as The Sims, Madden NFL, and the FC soccer series. The company has not yet commented on the speculation.</p>

          <p>A shopper in upstate New York discovered an extremely rare, live orange lobster in a supermarket tank and purchased it to ensure its survival. The odds of finding such a lobster are estimated at one in 30 million. The shopper, Kyle Brancato, temporarily housed the crustacean, nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, in a home aquarium. He then coordinated with the wildlife rescue group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium. The lobster was successfully released back into the open waters of the Long Island Sound, a day before National Lobster Day.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has readmitted former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum after they were suspended for a year. Their suspension resulted from voting against the government's two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour has recently softened its stance on. This move follows the reinstatement of four other MPs suspended for the same rebellion. Upon her return, Begum criticized the party for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience. The issue of the two-child cap, which limits benefits for larger families, is expected to be a major topic at the upcoming Labour conference amid growing internal pressure to abolish it.</p>

          <p>After securing their 12th division title in 13 years, members of the Los Angeles Dodgers acknowledged the difficulties of their season, attributing some struggles to a "World Series hangover." Players and management noted the physical and mental toll of attempting to be the first team to win consecutive championships in over two decades. The season was marked by bullpen regression, lineup slumps, and injuries, which some team members linked to the short offseason and the pressure of being defending champions. Despite these challenges, the team believes the adversity has made them more battle-tested and better prepared for the upcoming postseason.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Vice President Kamala Harris shared details about the day she learned she would be launching her presidential campaign. She revealed that the news came unexpectedly while she was at home in sweatpants, leading to an impromptu campaign strategy session over pizza at her dining table. Harris also reflected on certifying the 2024 election results, calling it one of the hardest things she has ever done but a non-negotiable duty to uphold the peaceful transfer of power. She described the emotional toll of conceding the election as a grieving process similar to what she felt after her mother's death.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York to support the U.S. team in their match against Europe. Greeted by cheers, Trump's arrival came as the American team was struggling in the morning matches, and he joked that he was there to help boost their performance. He briefly met with golfers Bryson DeChambeau and Ben Griffin on the first tee before watching the afternoon session for about two and a half hours. Top U.S. player Scottie Scheffler noted that the president's presence would be a boost for the team during a challenging time for the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that early October may be an opportune time for savers to open a certificate of deposit (CD) despite recent declines in interest rates. The first reason is to start earning compound interest immediately, as the rate will be fixed and predictable. Secondly, with the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut rates again at the end of the month, locking in a current rate now could be advantageous. Finally, banks may preemptively lower their CD rates before the official Fed announcement, meaning waiting could result in a lower return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado-based company Radia has presented its WindRunner cargo jet concept, a massive aircraft originally designed to transport 300-foot-long wind turbine blades. The company is now pitching the jet to the U.S. military as a potential solution for moving oversized cargo like tanks and helicopters. With a claimed cargo volume seven times that of a C-5 Galaxy, the WindRunner addresses the issue of current military aircraft running out of space before reaching their weight limits. While still in the design phase, the concept emerges as the U.S. Air Force considers replacements for its aging C-5 and C-17 fleets.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This authority had been revoked in 2019 and 2022, respectively, following fatal crashes and production defects, with the FAA taking over all certifications. The agency stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's production quality and will allow FAA inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance. This move is seen as a sign of returning confidence in the manufacturer, though the FAA's cap on MAX production remains in place following a midair incident earlier this year.</p>

Europe dominated the morning foursome session, winning three of the four matches and quieting the boisterous home crowd at Bethpage Black. Stars like Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy secured decisive victories, leaving the U.S. trailing 3-1.

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a new home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term or $1,452 for a 15-year term. These payments are modestly lower than they were earlier in the year, saving borrowers around $16 per month. While the savings are not dramatic, the potential for further rate cuts later this year could make exploring home equity financing a worthwhile option for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision follows a recommendation from an independent committee, which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population during the colonial era.

The young fan, Marcus Ruelos, then chose to return the ball to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat, stating the ball meant more to the player.
