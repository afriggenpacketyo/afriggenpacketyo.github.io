        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home's equity without making monthly payments, providing cash flow for retirees on fixed incomes. Contrary to some misconceptions, the borrower retains the title and legal ownership of the home throughout the loan period; the lender simply places a lien on the property. The loan balance, including interest and fees, becomes due when the homeowner sells the house, moves out permanently, or passes away. Heirs then have the option to repay the loan to keep the home or sell it to settle the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a first-hand account of U.S. President Donald Trump's recent diplomatic trip to Israel and Egypt, which he framed as a victory tour celebrating a fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza. Trump hailed the agreement as a historic achievement, suggesting "everlasting peace" was at hand, and took credit for brokering the cessation of major combat operations and the release of hostages. However, the report notes that the trip focused more on celebrating the moment than on addressing the complex details of Gaza's future governance and security. Key questions remain about the sustainability of the truce and the implementation of a proposed multinational stabilization force.</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 55 aircraft in September, including 40 of its 737 Max planes, bringing its total for the first nine months of the year to 440. This performance puts the company on track to have its most successful year for deliveries since 2018, before the 737 Max crashes led to a global grounding. The production stabilization signals a significant recovery for the aerospace giant, with CEO Kelly Ortberg expecting to increase the 737 Max production rate by the end of the year. The company also reported 48 net orders in September, highlighting continued demand for its aircraft.</p>

          <p>Social Security and SSI benefit payments will continue to be issued on schedule during the U.S. government shutdown because they are funded through a permanent appropriation. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could lead to disruptions in other services. According to the agency's contingency plan, nearly 90% of its workforce is considered essential, but services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards will be halted. Additionally, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, which might postpone the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced a major partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), committing to deploy 50,000 of AMD's new Instinct MI450 AI chips starting in the second half of 2026. This move signifies a growing trend among cloud providers to offer alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs, which currently dominate the artificial intelligence market with over 90% market share. The deal follows recent collaborations between AMD and OpenAI, which has also entered into a massive multi-year cloud agreement with Oracle.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion judgment against him for defaming the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones had falsely and repeatedly claimed on his Infowars platform that the 2012 massacre was a hoax. A Connecticut jury and judge awarded the massive sum in damages after finding him liable for the immense suffering he caused the victims' families. Jones's attorneys had argued the penalty was a "financial death penalty," but the high court denied the petition without comment, effectively ending his legal challenges to the verdict.</p>

          <p>The explosive growth of AI and data consumption is transforming commercial real estate, creating a new investment sector focused on "powered land." This refers to sites that are pre-approved and equipped with the massive electrical capacity needed to support data centers, which is now the primary bottleneck for development. Real estate investment firms like Hines are pivoting to secure these power rights and permits, creating a valuable and tradable asset before any construction begins. The demand is so high that an estimated 40,000 acres of powered land will be needed globally in the next five years to support data center growth.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new default content settings for Instagram users under the age of 18, designed to align with the standards of a PG-13 movie rating. The new protections will automatically place teen accounts into a more restrictive mode, which will block search results for sensitive terms and prevent them from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. The changes, which require parental permission to opt out of, are also being applied to Meta's integrated AI technology to ensure its responses are age-appropriate. A separate, even more restrictive setting called "Limited Content" will also be available for parents.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to purchase items from the retailer directly within the ChatGPT interface. The move is part of Walmart's strategy to adapt to evolving consumer shopping habits, where AI chatbots are increasingly used for product discovery and recommendations. This integration aims to create a more personalized and contextual shopping experience, moving beyond the traditional search bar format of e-commerce. The "Instant Checkout" feature represents a new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will charge a fee for transactions completed through its platform, though financial terms of the Walmart deal were not disclosed.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with every one of its business divisions posting record revenue. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, driven by strong performance in its services, banking, and markets segments. CEO Jane Fraser credited the positive results to the "relentless execution" of the company's strategy and investments in new products and technology. Despite the strong performance, expenses were up 9%, partly due to costs associated with the sale of its Mexico business, Banamex. The bank's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates falling to three-year lows in anticipation of further Federal Reserve rate cuts, the housing market is poised for shifts. Experts predict that lower rates will increase buyer competition, as more people will qualify for larger loans, potentially driving home prices higher. This surge in demand for both new mortgages and refinances could also lead to slower processing times and delays in closing. Financial advisors suggest that prospective buyers who find a home they can afford should consider acting now rather than waiting for rates to drop further, as they can always refinance later if rates become significantly more favorable.
