          <h2>Government Considers Social Media Time Limits for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 14:23:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is contemplating stricter online safety regulations, potentially limiting children's social media usage to two hours daily and imposing a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the addictive nature of apps and smartphones as the impetus for these considerations. Ian Russell, an online safety advocate, criticized the government's delay in enacting protective laws, pointing to the harm caused by weak regulation and tech companies prioritizing engagement over safety. Current parental controls offered by Apple and Google, along with TikTok's default 60-minute screen time limit for minors, are not widely adopted, suggesting a need for more comprehensive measures. Optimism regarding the safety and well-being of children online is somewhat tempered by the slow legislative progress.</p>

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia, prompting residents to evacuate buildings. The shallow quake's epicenter was near Paratebueno, southeast of Bogota, and tremors were felt in Medellin, Cali, and Manizales. The Colombian Geological Service reported additional aftershocks, but initial assessments indicated no significant damage in rural areas. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management is evaluating the situation across affected municipalities. Residents in Bogota experienced a significant scare, highlighting the region's vulnerability due to its location within the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade drink to its food court, sparking mixed reactions from members. The drink, priced at $2.99, is advertised as containing real fruit and no artificial flavors or colors, with 250 calories per serving. Some customers have praised it as refreshing, while others found it too tart or preferred the previous strawberry banana smoothie. Some customers have reported issues with the drink's texture, such as fruit chunks clogging the straw. The introduction of the new drink coincides with other recent changes to the Costco food court menu, including the revival of the combo pizza in calzone form and the replacement of Pepsi products with Coca-Cola.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles as the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships. Contempt, often expressed through tone, is a significant predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor, particularly the "invisible load," can lead to resentment, and ineffective communication can escalate minor issues. The article suggests strategies for addressing these conflicts, such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a "five-second rule" to de-escalate arguments.</p>
