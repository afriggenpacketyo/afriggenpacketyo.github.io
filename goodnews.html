          <p>The consumer price index (CPI) rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in April, resulting in an annual inflation rate of 2.3%, slightly below forecasts, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also increased by 0.2% for the month, with a year-over-year level of 2.8%. Shelter prices were a significant factor in pushing up the inflation gauge, while energy prices rebounded after a slide in March, and food prices saw a slight decline. President Trump's tariffs are a potential wild card in the inflation picture, depending on ongoing negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to the previous year, slightly cooling from the prior month, which defied concerns of an inflation surge following President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. While many analysts anticipated a rekindling of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect, a rollback of some levies may soften the impact. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had warned that sustained tariff increases could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, but the Fed opted to keep interest rates unchanged as they await the full impact of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reduced its China tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent for a temporary period, with China reciprocating by lowering its retaliatory levies, signaling a softening stance after previously asserting that China needed America more in trade. This move follows a pattern of Trump making bold claims about tariffs' leverage, only to later back down without significant concessions from the other country, as seen with Mexico and Canada. Despite the reduction, tariffs remain higher than pre-Trump's second term, likely leading to increased prices on various imported goods, including electronics and apparel.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor unveiled a redesigned version of its sole all-electric vehicle in the U.S., renaming it the "bZ" from the "bZ4X" for the 2026 model year. The update includes a 25% increase in EV range, up to 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities. This change aims to distance the updated model from its predecessor, which received lackluster reviews and experienced a recall shortly after its launch.</p>

          <p>A temporary tariff pause by the U.S. is providing Shein and Temu with an opportunity to restock U.S.-based warehouses and reassess their supply chain management. The U.S. and China agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days, and a "de minimis" rule relaxation will see low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China now taxed at a tariff rate of 54%, down from 120% prior. This has given the companies a chance to ramp up shipments from China and fulfill existing orders.</p>

          <p>Despite a 90-day trade truce between the U.S. and China, the underlying trade relationship remains fragile and subject to re-escalation, with a 34% "default" tariff looming if progress is not made. Sectors like advanced semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and steel are still subject to "strategic decoupling," while China is using this window to harden its supply chains. Businesses should treat this truce as an opportunity to fortify short-term plans and accelerate long-term diversification strategies to reduce structural dependence on China.</p>

          <p>Three House committees are meeting to advance a budget package addressing President Trump's defense, energy, and tax priorities, but major divisions among Republicans persist. The bill includes changes to Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts, but disagreements remain on overhauling Medicaid and extending a tax deduction. Republicans face challenges in securing enough support for the bill, as some members demand steeper cuts to Medicaid and express concerns about the impact of the proposals.</p>

          <p>A driving school in Springfield, Ohio, is providing Haitian Creole-speaking driving lessons to help Haitian immigrants integrate into the community, addressing concerns about traffic safety and unlicensed drivers. The program, which includes in-person instruction and driving simulators, has seen a high success rate among Haitian clients, contributing to a decrease in crashes in Springfield. While these efforts are helping Haitians gain driving skills, changes in immigration policies are causing some to leave the US.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between Beijing and Washington, Chinese factories are rapidly resuming production to fulfill orders that had been frozen due to high tariffs. Factory owners are receiving urgent requests from US buyers to expedite deliveries, and are preparing for potential future instability due to the Trump administration's trade policies. Despite the rush to capitalize on the 90-day pause, factories remain cautious about the long-term outlook.</p>
