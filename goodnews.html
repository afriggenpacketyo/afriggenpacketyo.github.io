        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build a network of "AI gigafactories" in an effort to catch up with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence development. With an initial investment of 10 billion euros for 13 factories and a further 20 billion euros for larger "gigafactories," the plan aims to create ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent. These facilities are designed to help thousands of European AI startups overcome the lack of computing capacity, a major obstacle to their growth. While the initiative has drawn significant interest, challenges remain, including securing private investment and addressing the immense power consumption requirements of such large-scale data centers.

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their mission to save lives at sea, regardless of politics, after facing criticism for rescuing migrants in the English Channel. Some have accused the charity of acting as a "taxi service," but the RNLI emphasizes its humanitarian duty to respond to any distress call from the Coastguard. The organization released harrowing footage of a recent rescue to show the dangerous reality of these situations, where crews have saved dozens of lives. Crew members shared emotional accounts of their experiences, reinforcing their commitment to compassion.</p>

          <h2>India Surpasses China as Top Smartphone Exporter to the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:38:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to a report from Canalys. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, while China's share fell to 25%. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties. The trend reflects a broader move by global manufacturers to diversify their supply chains, with India emerging as a key hub for electronics assembly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to maintain an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" from China. In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, urging Seoul to deepen pragmatic cooperation. The call signals Beijing's effort to reset ties with South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is perceived as more open to engagement with China than his predecessor. The discussion also touched on ensuring the success of the upcoming APEC summit in Gyeongju as a potential turning point for bilateral relations.</p>

          <h2>China Introduces Nationwide Subsidy to Encourage Higher Birth Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 23:38:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing a demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy program to boost the country's falling birth rate. The policy will offer parents an annual payment of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for each child under the age of three, benefiting an estimated 20 million families. This move follows various local incentives and comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024. High child-rearing costs are a major deterrent for many couples, and this nationwide financial support is part of a broader government effort to address the economic and social challenges of a rapidly aging population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed a new order for 300,000 H20 chipsets with manufacturer TSMC, signaling a response to robust demand from China for its specialized AI hardware. This move comes after the Trump administration reversed an effective ban, allowing Nvidia to resume sales of the H20 GPU, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions. The decision to restart production, which adds to an existing inventory, suggests a change in strategy for Nvidia, which had previously indicated it might rely on current stockpiles. The company still requires U.S. government export licenses to ship the chips to Chinese customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to discuss plans for a humanitarian airlift of aid into the Gaza Strip. The move comes as the German government faces significant public pressure to take a stronger stance on the humanitarian crisis, with a new survey showing 74% of Germans believe more should be done to press Israel. Germany, traditionally one of Israel's strongest allies, is now looking to work with Jordan, a key hub for aid delivery, to help alleviate the severe conditions in Gaza. This reflects growing international concern over the potential for mass starvation in the besieged enclave.</p>

          <p>Deion "Coach Prime" Sanders, head football coach for the Colorado Buffaloes, has revealed he was diagnosed with bladder cancer and has since been declared "cancer-free" after successful treatment. During a press conference with his medical team, doctors confirmed that a high-grade tumor was removed and his bladder was replaced with a new one created from his intestines. Sanders, who became emotional while discussing his journey, said he kept the diagnosis private from his team and the public. He expressed hope that sharing his story would encourage others to be proactive about their health and schedule medical checkups.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful performance in a 5-2 victory against the Cincinnati Reds, continuing his midseason resurgence. The Japanese star pitched seven superb innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters. After a shaky period earlier in the season, Yamamoto has returned to his dominant form, lowering his ERA to 2.48, which is among the best in the National League. His command of multiple pitches kept the Reds off balance after the first inning, providing a strong foundation for the Dodgers' offense to secure the win.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's planned stopover in the United States en route to South America has been canceled. The Financial Times reported that Washington informed Lai he could not stop in New York, a move that avoids a certain point of friction with Beijing. Taiwan's Presidential Office officially attributed the decision to domestic priorities, including typhoon recovery efforts. The cancellation of the transit, which Beijing would have strongly opposed, is seen by some analysts as a gesture that could ease tensions and potentially facilitate a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump later this year.</p>

The meeting follows Starmer's discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump, where he presented the proposal developed with France and Germany after U.S.-led peace talks stalled. The move comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government, with over 140 Labour MPs signing a letter urging the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state. Downing Street has described Palestinian statehood as a matter of "when, not if," and is coordinating with allies to find a path toward a sustainable two-state solution.</p>

Discovered in what is now Qinghai province, the stone is described as the only known carving from that era that remains at its original site.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with Donald Trump in Scotland provided him with invaluable face time and access to the U.S. president, but it also came with considerable political risks. The trip involved a mix of formal diplomacy and Trump's characteristic free-wheeling style, including an extended, impromptu press conference covering a vast range of topics. For Starmer, navigating these interactions required careful maneuvering to defend his own policies while burnishing a key international relationship. Downing Street views the direct access as crucial for advancing UK interests, particularly on issues like Gaza, where they hope to align with a toughening U.S. outlook.</p>
