        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More and more young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' choosing to do the bare minimum at their jobs to prioritize personal time and work-life balance. This trend marks a shift from previous generations who prioritized hard work and company loyalty. A study found that nearly half of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to 'quiet quit.' This article explores the reasons behind this shift, including a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, overcoming a blown save and a rain delay that limited starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw to just two innings.

Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th inning ultimately secured the win for the Dodgers, but the game's length could have future consequences for the team's pitching depth.</p>
