        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders openly discussed his frustration after being benched by head coach Kevin Stefanski before a game-winning drive in a preseason victory. Sanders, who struggled with five sacks earlier in the game, had hoped to lead the final two-minute drive but was replaced by Tyler Huntley, who secured the win. Stefanski defended his decision, citing the plan to play Huntley, who was later cut, and denying any intent to sabotage Sanders' development. The team has named Joe Flacco as the Week 1 starter, with the backup position still uncertain amidst other quarterback injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GLP-1 drugs, including Ozempic and Wegovy, are increasingly popular for weight loss and show promise for treating various conditions from cardiovascular disease to addiction. While effective, the long-term impact of these medications on human desire and emotion remains a significant unanswered question. Scientists are investigating whether these drugs can selectively suppress harmful compulsions without affecting productive desires or the experience of joy and pain. Experts caution against viewing them as a "wonder drug," emphasizing the need for more research into their effects on the brain's desire pathways and the importance of combining medication with behavioral changes for sustainable health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent independence day greetings to Ukraine, acknowledging 33 years of steady bilateral relations and cooperation. Ukrainian President Zelensky expressed appreciation for the congratulations, emphasizing mutual respect and the pursuit of peace and stability. This exchange comes amid international scrutiny of China's growing closeness with Russia since the invasion, with Beijing maintaining its neutral stance on the conflict. The message, posted by Zelensky, highlights a diplomatic overture from China, though Beijing has not publicly released the message itself, reflecting the delicate balance in its foreign policy.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Fish May Experience Pleasure from Grooming</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that fish, often considered simple-minded, may experience pleasure and actively seek it out, challenging previous assumptions focused primarily on their negative experiences. A study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involving bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, found that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been groomed by cleanerfish. Experiments with opioid-mimicking drugs and blockers suggest that the fish's opioid system mediates this pleasurable sensation, while a separate dopamine-related system drives their desire to seek it again. These findings prompt a reevaluation of fish welfare in aquariums and aquaculture.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is forecast to continue its north-northeasterly path over the central Atlantic Ocean through Monday and Tuesday, posing no threat to land. Located approximately 360 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, the storm has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is moving at 12 mph. Some strengthening is possible today, but weakening is expected to begin tonight, with Fernand becoming post-tropical by Wednesday. This marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, and NOAA has predicted an above-normal season.</p>

          <h2>China Increases E-commerce Delivery Fees to Counter Low-Price Competition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 05:30:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has increased minimum e-commerce delivery fees in several provinces, including Guangdong, to combat "disorderly low-price competition" and prevent harmful price spirals. This move, primarily affecting e-commerce clients rather than individual consumers, aligns with Beijing's broader "anti-involution drive" to regulate the market, improve product quality, and eliminate outdated capacity. The Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, chaired by President Xi Jinping, emphasized the need for lawful regulation to guide companies towards healthier competition. This policy is expected to expand to more regions as China seeks to optimize its economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Chaotic scenes unfolded at the US Open when Daniil Medvedev experienced a match-point meltdown during his first-round loss to Benjamin Bonzi. A photographer entering the court mid-serve caused a re-do, sparking Medvedev's furious outburst at the umpire and the crowd. The disruption led to a six-minute halt, with fans booing, yet Medvedev leveraged the chaos to force a fourth set before ultimately losing. The former champion's dramatic exit, combined with his post-match comments, highlighted the intense pressure and emotional volatility often present in high-stakes tennis matches, creating a memorable moment for spectators.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical advantage of left-handed tennis players at the US Open and suggests a potential resurgence of southpaws like Ben Shelton and Jack Draper. Historically, lefties like Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe dominated the tournament, but their prevalence has waned in recent decades. The unique ball trajectories and spins from left-handers continue to confound right-handed opponents, similar to southpaw pitchers in baseball. With young talents like Shelton and Draper enjoying strong seasons, the article posits that lefties could soon break the stranglehold of top-ranked players and add new dynamics to major titles.</p>

South Korea views North Korea as its primary threat and seeks to avoid entanglement in a potential conflict over Taiwan, emphasizing alliance credibility and deterrence against Pyongyang. Additionally, Lee faces the challenge of finalizing a trade deal where South Korea pledged $350 billion in investments to lower US tariffs, with details and profit distribution still contentious.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public education system has transformed into an almost entirely charter-based model, with significant improvements in test scores and graduation rates. Initially met with resistance, the shift granted schools greater autonomy, leading to better outcomes compared to the struggling pre-Katrina district. However, the article notes challenges like early "no-excuses" discipline, uneven access to quality schools based on socioeconomic status, and the pain of school closures. While the system has evolved through learning from mistakes, it remains a "work in progress," with ongoing debates about its future direction and ensuring equitable education for all.</p>

          <p>The fitness trend of wearing weighted vests is gaining popularity, with influencers claiming benefits for posture, weight loss, cardiovascular health, and bone and muscle growth. However, this article fact-checks these claims, revealing that current research does not significantly support their effectiveness for bone density and muscle strength. Experts state that traditional resistance training with weights is far more effective for building strength. While weighted vests can increase calorie burn and cardiovascular exertion, they are not a substitute for proven strength-building exercises.

The Gobi Desert, a major source of sand and dust, fueled China's worst sandstorm in a decade in 2021, highlighting the urgent need for international cooperation.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects moderate inflation for 2025 and has already eased monetary policy twice this year to counter weaker growth and rising trade tensions.
