          <p>Two years after a devastating season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his New York Jets career, quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The opening game of the season pits him directly against the Jets, the team that recently released him. The article recounts the immense hype and subsequent disappointment of his brief tenure in New York, framing this Week 1 matchup as a dramatic opportunity for closure for both the player and his former team.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a prime suspect in a series of 2003 bombings in California linked to animal rights extremism, is facing an extradition hearing in London. After evading capture for 21 years and being on the FBI's most wanted list with a $250,000 bounty, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in Wales. Former FBI agents reflect on what they describe as "missed opportunities" to arrest him before he vanished following a high-speed chase in 2003.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans secured a decisive 59-20 victory against Georgia Southern, in a game that marked the return of former coach Clay Helton to the Coliseum. USC's offense was prolific, amassing 755 total yards, with quarterback Jayden Maiava throwing for 412 yards and four touchdowns before being rested. The dominant performance allowed USC to give valuable playing time to backup players, though the defense showed some vulnerabilities by allowing several big plays and committing numerous penalties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers from the US and China has developed a novel method for launching tiny robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat a surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that violently collapse, creating a powerful launching force. This technique can propel millimeter-scale objects high into the air or be controlled to make them "swim" in water, opening new possibilities for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>In response to new state laws and growing concerns about classroom distractions, school districts across the U.S. are implementing locked magnetic pouches to manage student cellphone use. Companies like Yondr provide pouches that students carry, which are locked upon entering the school and can only be opened at designated magnetic stations. The article explores the mixed reactions from students, the costs for school districts, and the belief among educators that the system will help students re-engage with in-person learning.</p>
