          <p>The 2025 Kentucky Derby is set to feature 19 horses, with Journalism entering as the morning-line favorite, boasting a strong record in graded-stakes races. Trainer Michael McCarthy hopes Journalism's performance can bring some joy to the Altadena community, which was affected by wildfires. Sovereignty and Sandman are also considered strong contenders. Last year's Derby saw Mystik Dan win in a photo finish, and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., who won both the Derby and Oaks in 2024, will be riding Burnham Square this year.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting a tsunami warning that was later canceled after no tsunami was detected. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for the Strait of Magellan as a precaution, with residents calmly evacuating. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Drake Passage, south of Ushuaia, Argentina, where water activities were temporarily suspended.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party is slightly ahead of the Liberal-National coalition led by Peter Dutton in opinion polls. Dutton's campaign has been compared to Donald Trump's messaging, which may have contributed to a decline in support. Albanese has maintained a moderate stance towards Trump, and the election results could lead to a minority government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore funding to Maine schools after threatening to withhold it over the state's support of transgender rights. Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration's demands that trans girls be barred from participating in girls' sports. Maine sued the USDA to maintain its funding, which helps feed 172,000 children in the state. The settlement restores the funds, though a separate lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the Maine Department of Education over its policy for trans athletes remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order sent a message that lawyers must stick to the party line, violating the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained Christopher Steele. The executive order called for the suspension of security clearances and limited access to federal buildings for firm employees.</p>

          <p>Remains of domestic cats discovered in a 16th-century Spanish shipwreck may represent the earliest evidence of cats in the United States. The shipwreck, Emanuel Point II, sank in Florida's Pensacola Bay in 1559, and the remains of an adult and juvenile cat were found within the wreckage. Researchers believe cats accompanied sailors on ships to control rat and mice populations. Analysis suggests the cats ate a diet of fish and possibly domestic meat, indicating they were likely cared for by the sailors.</p>
