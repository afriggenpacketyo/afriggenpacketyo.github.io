        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo returns with his new English-language film, "Daniela Forever," a story about a man who uses an experimental dream treatment to cope with his girlfriend's death. In an interview, Vigalondo explains that the film, starring Henry Golding and Beatrice Grannò, explores themes of addiction to an idealized reality, comparing it to modern phenomena like AI relationships. He discusses the creative process, including shooting in Madrid and using obsolete Betamax cameras to visually distinguish the real world from the more vivid dream world. The director also reflects on the influence of the late David Lynch on his work.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:14:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight," directed by Embeth Davidtz, offers a poignant look at the final days of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia in 1980 through the eyes of a 7-year-old white girl named Bobo. Based on Alexandra Fuller's memoir, the movie captures the tense atmosphere of a country on the brink of change, with Bobo's family on edge amid civil war and the rise of Robert Mugabe. The review praises the film for humanizing a complex and fraught period, highlighting the "astonishing" lead performance by Lexi Venter. It successfully portrays the political turmoil and racial tensions of the era from a child's blunt, yet revealing perspective.</p>

          <h2>Report Explores How Annuities Can Strategically Supplement Social Security Benefits in Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to supplement and enhance Social Security benefits, providing retirees with a more stable financial future. This article outlines how the guaranteed income from an annuity can allow individuals to delay claiming Social Security, thereby increasing their monthly payments. Furthermore, annuities can fill income gaps left by Social Security, cover essential expenses, and potentially help manage the tax liability on retirement benefits. By creating a predictable "paycheck," the combination of these two income streams can offer retirees greater financial security and peace of mind. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will use its All-Star Game as a testing ground for the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System, marking another step toward its potential regular-season use. Under the system, each team will receive two challenges that can be initiated by the pitcher, catcher, or batter to review a ball or strike call. The technology, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2021, aims to improve accuracy, though human umpires have already increased their correctness significantly. If the trial is successful with players and fans, the challenge system could be considered for implementation in the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own hardware to cool Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips, which require liquid cooling due to the intense heat they generate. This development allows Amazon to upgrade its existing data centers for the new chips without the time and expense of building new facilities. The in-house solution, called In-Row Heat Exchangers (IHRX), is a positive step for both Amazon and Nvidia, enabling wider and faster deployment of advanced AI technology. The move is not expected to negatively impact industrial suppliers that provide other essential components for data center infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Philharmonic opened its 103rd season at the Hollywood Bowl with a program of Russian music, but the evening was marked by a subdued mood and noticeably low attendance. The concert, led by guest conductor Thomas Sondergard, took place as the season faces challenges, including the cancellation of an appearance by Gustavo Dudamel's Simón Bolivar Symphony Orchestra due to a travel ban. The review notes that the performance of works by Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev felt fitting for the current edgy times. It also highlights the continued relevance of Russian composers who grappled with militarism and nationalism.</p>

          <p>Joe Root demonstrated exceptional skill and determination, finishing the first day of the third Test against India just one run short of a century with an unbeaten 99. On a slow and difficult pitch at Lord's, Root's performance was crucial in guiding England to a score of 251-4. England was forced to adopt a more cautious approach, battling a relentless Indian bowling attack in extreme heat. Despite losing key wickets, Root built important partnerships to keep England in a competitive position in what is shaping up to be an attritional match.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article highlights six key aspects of Liberia's deep historical connection to the United States. Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, explaining the American-style accent. The nation's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. The report also notes that many of its past presidents were born in the U.S., providing important context for the U.S. president's comments.</p>

If it occurs, this would be the first in-person meeting between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also suggested the U.S. might ask for Beijing's assistance in persuading Russia to end the war in Ukraine, acknowledging China's support for Moscow's efforts. The potential for dialogue comes despite Rubio's hawkish reputation on China and the fact that he has been sanctioned twice by Beijing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking President Trump's executive order that aims to end birthright citizenship for some children born in the U.S. The order challenges the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment by arguing children of parents in the U.S. illegally or temporarily should not receive automatic citizenship. The judge also certified the case as a class action lawsuit, broadening the injunction's protection to all children who could be affected by the policy. This ruling is one of several legal challenges across the country seeking to halt the administration's controversial move.</p>

          <p>This article revisits Virginia Woolf's unpublished 1932 letter, where she fiercely defended "highbrow" art while delivering a withering attack on the "middlebrow." Woolf defined the middlebrow as a dishonest consumer of art who lacks genuine taste and instead follows fashion, preferring inoffensive depictions of life. She argued that both highbrows, who pursue ideas, and lowbrows, who pursue life, were honest in their tastes, but she would "stab dead" anyone who called her middlebrow. The essay reflects the cultural anxieties of early 20th-century England and explores how the term's definition has since softened.</p>

          <p>If your migraines seem more frequent or severe in the summer, you are not alone, as weather-related factors can be significant triggers. A neurologist explains that changes in weather, bright sun, and even shifting from outdoor heat to indoor air conditioning can provoke migraine attacks. Dehydration is another major contributor, making it critical for sufferers to stay hydrated. To help prevent summer migraines, experts recommend wearing sunglasses, ensuring proper rest, reducing stress, and choosing fragrance-free summer products, as strong odors can also be a trigger.</p>
