          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary has revealed a significant rift within the Democratic party, prompting concern among moderate business leaders and politicians. In response, some are strategizing to support an independent candidate to challenge Mamdani in the general election, with figures like billionaire Bill Ackman pledging financial backing. However, progressive leaders like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue the victory shows Mamdani's policies align with the majority of voters. Mamdani has expressed a commitment to meeting with all stakeholders, including concerned business executives, to move the city forward.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project, a community coalition, is working to uncover and memorialize the region's history of racial terror lynchings. The group recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was killed by a mob in 1924, and collected soil from the site as part of a national project. Members, some with personal family connections to lynchings, are driven to confront this painful past, especially as efforts to teach Black history face political attacks. Despite some local resistance, the project has received broad support for bringing a forgotten and violent history to light.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and pressure from allies, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending to build the largest military in Europe. The government intends to change its constitution to allow for increased borrowing, aiming to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense over the next decade. This move marks a historic departure from Germany's post-war policy of military restraint. The plan includes a special fund of over $100 billion and is intended to rebuild the nation's armed forces and meet NATO commitments without cutting social programs.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Spirit of Pride Is Progress and Diversity, Not Respectability Politics</h2>

          <p>This column argues against the push for "respectability politics" within the LGBTQ+ community, criticizing conservative gay figures who attempt to distance themselves from more flamboyant or gender-nonconforming members. The author contends that the history of the gay rights movement, from the Stonewall Riots led by drag queens to the first out political candidates, has always been rooted in diversity and challenging norms. The piece asserts that the true spirit of Pride is about collective progress and celebrating all facets of the community, not about conforming to mainstream expectations to gain acceptance. It highlights that this inclusive spirit is what makes the movement both beautiful and fundamentally American.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1972 murder trial and wrongful conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther Party leader in Los Angeles. Defended by a young Johnnie Cochran, Pratt was sentenced to life in prison based on questionable witness testimony and hidden evidence, a case Cochran later called a zone of "deceit" and "official corruption." The conviction was finally overturned after 27 years when it was revealed that authorities, including the FBI under its COINTELPRO program, had concealed evidence of their star witness being an informant. The case stands as a stark example of how the justice system was weaponized against perceived subversives.</p>

          <h2>Huntington Beach Voters Reject Conservative Proposals on Library Book Selection and Privatization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political outcome, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public library system. The measures successfully blocked a controversial proposal to create a parent review board for children's books and prevented the potential privatization of the city's libraries. This result is viewed as a rebuke to the city's conservative-majority council, which had pushed for these changes, and is being celebrated by local activists as a victory for community organizing. The campaign's success suggests that even in conservative-leaning areas, there are limits to the reach of culture war politics.</p>

          <p>Jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington led a massive musical event to mark the first time the public was admitted into the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new David Geffen Galleries building. Over one hundred musicians were spread throughout the still-empty structure, performing an expanded version of Washington's "Harmony of Difference" EP. The performance was a grand-scale celebration that explored the unique acoustic properties of the new Peter Zumthor-designed space. Critics praised the event for its splendor and for demonstrating the building's potential as a major venue for performance art, drawing parallels to the museum's musical inauguration 70 years prior.</p>

Rauhin, a 24-year-old female, and her three offspring left from Kansai International Airport for a breeding research base in Sichuan Province. Their departure marks the near-conclusion of a successful joint breeding program that began in 1994 and has raised 17 cubs, the most outside of China.

          <p>President Trump's week was marked by significant events, including a favorable Supreme Court ruling that limits nationwide injunctions against his executive orders and a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following U.S. strikes. The administration also secured increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies. However, major challenges remain unresolved, including the uncertain fate of his "big, beautiful bill" in the Senate and a fast-approaching deadline for dozens of trade deals. This confluence of high-stakes issues at home and abroad is creating a defining and pressure-filled moment for his presidency.</p>
