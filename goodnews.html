          <h2>Global Survey Shows China Gaining Favorability While US Declines Under Trump 2.0</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by Morning Consult indicates that favorable views of China have surpassed those of the United States globally between January and late April, a shift that marks a contrast from the previous year. The US's standing has diminished in 38 of the 41 markets tracked, with China's improving in 34, except for Russia, where the US saw a significant improvement since Trump's return to office. Sixteen countries switched from pro-US to pro-China during the surveyed period, and the report attributes the shift to damage to America's reputation over the past few months. The survey included around 4,900 adults in 41 countries, excluding views from US and Chinese respondents about their own countries.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's move to legalise stablecoins is garnering attention from mainland institutions, with Citic Securities predicting a boom in tokenised real-world assets (RWA) in the city. Analysts suggest that stablecoins could help mainland companies roll out their RWA projects in Hong Kong by serving as stabilising tools to increase market liquidity. Citic Securities analysts believe the new law will also help Hong Kong develop interfaces for digital currency payment and settlement. The US Senate has also advanced its own bill called the Genius Act, which focuses on these assets.</p>

          <p>Constellation Energy's shares experienced a significant rally after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power, joining other tech giants in supporting the industry to meet the growing power demands of data centers. Beginning in June 2027, Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, supporting the plant's continuing operation and relicensing. The plant will continue to provide power to the regional grid while contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity, and the deal will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts.</p>

          <p>Former American track and field star Maurice Greene has reacted to the disqualification of a California high school sprinter, Clara Adams, for performing his signature fire extinguisher celebration. Adams was disqualified after she sprayed her shoes with a fire extinguisher, alluding to her being on fire, after winning the 400 finals. Greene, who performed a similar celebration after winning the 100-meter dash at the 2004 Home Depot Invitational, stated that he would reinstate her if the celebration did not interfere with anyone. Adams' father believes the decision was racially motivated, as the celebration occurred away from her opponents, but the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) upheld the disqualification.</p>

Zava CEO David Meinertz said the deal will provide relief to an otherwise overwhelmed European healthcare system, and the platforms will maintain their branding for a "few quarters" before being rebranded as Hims & Hers.

However, Laos still struggles to raise living standards, with nearly 17% of its families living in poverty as of 2023. Analysts warn that not all visitors bring new business to the local population, such as "zero-dollar" tour groups that only spend money in Chinese-associated businesses.</p>

Mount Etna and its surroundings are home to a variety of animals, and volcanic soil is good for agriculture, with vineyards, olive groves, orchards, hazelnut and pistachio groves flourishing in the area.

          <p>Millennials, now entering their 40s, are facing a unique midlife crisis shaped by economic instability, social media, and a different set of expectations than previous generations. The traditional midlife crisis involving a red sports car and a younger girlfriend doesn't resonate with many millennials, who are more focused on personal growth, experiences, and mental health. Many millennials are reevaluating their careers and seeking more fulfilling paths, while others are embracing fitness as a way to gain control and a sense of accomplishment. Understanding and deconstructing traditional ideas about midlife crises can help millennials navigate this transition in a healthy and positive way.</p>
