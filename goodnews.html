          <p>David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former president of Caltech, has passed away at 87. Renowned for his discovery of reverse transcriptase, which was crucial for understanding viruses like HIV, Baltimore was a leading figure in 20th-century science. He actively engaged in debates on genetic engineering ethics and led major institutions, including the Whitehead Institute. His career also included a period of controversy over scientific misconduct allegations, from which he was eventually exonerated, before taking the helm at Caltech.</p>

          <p>A social media debate comparing Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney at age 17 has intensified, with Rooney offering a diplomatic response to Owen's self-proclaimed superiority. Owen cited his significantly higher Premier League goal tally and Ballon d'Or win at a young age as evidence. Rooney, while acknowledging Owen's comments as fair, expressed admiration for Owen as a player he looked up to. The discussion highlights their different career trajectories, with Owen's career curtailed by injuries while Rooney achieved greater longevity and club success.</p>

          <p>Japanese markets saw a significant jump, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix climbing to a record high, following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement. The market's positive reaction reflects excitement around potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi seen as a candidate likely to drive growth and deregulation. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen weakened, and bond yields rose amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts predict a period of extended uncertainty for Japan's political landscape into Q4 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Joint China-US Study Reveals Mars Possesses an Unexpected Solid Inner Core</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative China-US study, utilizing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This discovery is surprising because Mars, unlike Earth, was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core. The finding could reignite the debate about whether Earth was unique in developing plate tectonics. This research suggests that Mars, like Earth and the moon, has achieved a similar geological structure, challenging previous planetary formation assumptions.</p>
