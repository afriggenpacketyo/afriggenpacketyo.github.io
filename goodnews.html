          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 02:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's Supreme Court has mandated increased food provisions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, overturning a policy of reduced rations implemented by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) brought the matter to court, highlighting malnutrition among prisoners due to the policy change after the Gaza war began. ACRI criticized the prison service for creating "torture camps," while Ben-Gvir condemned the ruling and insisted on maintaining minimum conditions required by law. Leaked data suggests that only a quarter of Palestinian prisoners have links to Hamas or other militant groups, raising questions about the justification for blanket restrictions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 33% in August, contributing to an overall slowdown in export growth to a six-month low, partially influenced by President Trump's measures against transshipments. Imports from the U.S. also decreased by 16% year-over-year, while China's total exports grew by 4.4%, falling short of economists' expectations. Chinese exporters are focusing on alternative markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union due to trade tensions with the U.S. Despite the decline, the U.S. remains China's largest single-country trading partner, though exports to the EU bloc are higher overall.

Asia-Pacific markets also traded mostly higher, assessing Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation.

          <p>A China-US study has found that Mars has a solid inner core, despite expectations that it should not. The discovery was made by analysing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by Nasa’s now-retired InSight lander. The team discovered a solid core about 600km in radius, or roughly 18 per cent of Mars’ radius, a similar proportion to Earth’s inner core. The discovery may revive the idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.</p>
