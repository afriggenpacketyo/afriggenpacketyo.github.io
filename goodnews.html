        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 has rebounded to near-record levels, surprising some analysts given persistent geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and uncertainty. This resilience is attributed to several factors, including strong corporate earnings, particularly in the tech sector, and the enduring investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Additionally, the robust U.S. economy, characterized by low unemployment, and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in the year have bolstered market confidence. The perception that major trade conflicts are being de-escalated has also helped ease investor anxiety and fuel the market's recovery.</p>

          <p>A restructured federal advisory panel, now under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has recommended Merck's new antibody shot, Enflonsia, to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This decision allows the shot to be launched before the upcoming RSV season and included in the government's childhood immunization program, ensuring broad insurance coverage. The vote is seen as a relief to the public health community, which had expressed concern after Kennedy, a known vaccine critic, overhauled the committee. The shot is designed to compete with a similar product from Sanofi and AstraZeneca.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated in an interview that artificial intelligence is now handling a significant portion of the company's work, estimated between 30% and 50%. He emphasized that society must adapt to the idea of AI taking over existing tasks, which allows employees to focus on higher-value activities. This shift reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are aggressively integrating AI to enhance efficiency and cut costs. The move follows Salesforce's decision earlier this year to reduce its workforce by over 1,000 positions as part of a restructuring centered on AI.</p>

Pritzker, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and is seen as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, did not commit to serving a full third term if re-elected.</p>

          <p>Three-time Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon of Kenya is attempting to become the first woman in history to run a mile in under four minutes. The 31-year-old athlete will need to beat her own world record of 4 minutes, 7.64 seconds at a special Nike-sponsored exhibition event in Paris. To achieve this "moonshot" goal, she will utilize rotating pacers to reduce air resistance, a strategy famously employed by Roger Bannister in his record-breaking 1954 run. While the event is not eligible for official record-keeping, a successful run would be a monumental achievement in track and field history.</p>

          <p>Denis Villeneuve, the acclaimed director of "Dune" and "Blade Runner 2049," has been chosen to direct the next installment of the James Bond franchise. The decision by Amazon MGM marks a significant step in the series' future following the departure of Daniel Craig. Villeneuve, a self-professed "die-hard Bond fan," expressed his excitement and respect for the iconic character, calling it "sacred territory." While this news has been welcomed by fans, the film is not expected soon, as Villeneuve is currently working on "Dune: Messiah," and the crucial casting decision for the next actor to play 007 has not yet been announced.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the cultural history of how getting little sleep became a marker of dedication and success in America, from early exhortations about great men being early risers to modern tech CEOs bragging about all-nighters. This mindset is rooted in the Protestant work ethic and the more recent phenomenon of "workism," where college-educated individuals derive their identity from their careers. This cultural pressure to defy the body's natural need for rest has also created a market for products promising to keep people awake, from coffee to energy drinks. Despite growing awareness of sleep's importance, the perception of rest as laziness remains deeply ingrained.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a consensus that it's nearly impossible to change people's meat-eating habits, a new, not-yet-published study suggests that viewing high-quality, graphic footage of factory farming can have a significant impact. In the experiment, students who watched a 16-minute clip from the documentary "Dominion" were 12.2% less likely to choose meat in a meal a week later. This finding challenges the long-held belief in the animal advocacy movement that individual persuasion is ineffective, a belief that led many groups to pivot towards corporate and political campaigns instead of public education over the last decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay posits that the key to finding a "calling" in one's work is not to wait for the perfect job to appear, but to actively make any job meaningful. Drawing on a Zen Buddhist story, the author suggests this can be achieved through three steps: focusing on intrinsic rewards rather than just pay, finding aspects of the work that are genuinely interesting, and actively looking for opportunities to be of service to others. The author reflects that this approach can transform even a seemingly mundane or unsatisfying job into a vehicle for life's purpose, creating satisfaction and a sense of vocation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the multi-millionaire serving as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, seemed to reveal a misunderstanding of how credit cards work during a Fox News interview. While discussing efforts to streamline medical prior authorizations, he made an analogy to credit cards, stating, "When you put it into the machine to buy something, they don‚Äôt prior authorize you. You either have money in the bank or you don‚Äôt." This comment overlooks that credit cards are a form of borrowing, not a direct debit from a bank account, and that every transaction is, in fact, pre-authorized by the card issuer.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 11:48:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five ways consumers can deal with a charged-off credit card account, a situation where a lender writes off a debt as a loss but the consumer is still legally obligated to pay it. The options include paying the full balance immediately if possible, or negotiating a lump-sum settlement for a lower amount, which creditors often accept. For those without immediate cash, setting up a payment plan with the creditor is another viable path. Alternatively, one can dispute the debt if there are inaccuracies or, as a last resort, let the account age off the credit report after seven years, though this risks continued collection efforts.</p>
