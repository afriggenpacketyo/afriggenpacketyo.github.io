        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese authorities have implemented new regulations to combat the proliferation of false and misleading medical information online, specifically targeting "self-media" health accounts. The "Guidelines for Regulating Medical Science Self-Media Behaviour" impose stricter requirements on healthcare practitioners sharing information and demand greater responsibility from platforms to verify account credentials and content authenticity. This initiative aims to clearly differentiate genuine public health education from deceptive commercial advertising, following the recent release of detailed guidelines for recognizing medical advertisements. The government's decisive action underscores a significant effort to enhance the reliability and accuracy of health-related content across digital platforms, ensuring public safety and trust in medical advice.</p>

          <p>Dogs are increasingly becoming integral parts of wedding ceremonies, often serving as ring bearers, flower girls, or honored guests, reflecting their status as cherished family members. Couples like Ellie and Brad included their sheepadoodle, Newton, in multiple roles, highlighting the immense joy and emotional support pets bring to such significant occasions. Specialized dog chaperone services, like Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party, have emerged to help plan and manage dogs' involvement, a testament to the growing demand and the desire for pet-inclusive celebrations. These services ensure pets are well-cared for, appropriately attired, and can participate meaningfully, often charming guests and creating memorable, heartwarming moments for everyone involved.</p>

          <h2>European Heatwave Fuels Surge in Demand for Chinese Air Conditioners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 04:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe is currently enduring a prolonged and severe summer heatwave, which has led to a significant nearly 60% surge in Chinese air conditioner exports to the continent in July compared to the previous year. Major cities across the continent, from Madrid to Paris, are under high heat alerts, highlighting Europe's notable unpreparedness for such extreme temperatures despite its generally northern latitude. This escalating demand is proving highly beneficial for Chinese brands, which collectively dominate the global air conditioning market, producing approximately 80% of the world's cooling units. The trend clearly underscores the increasing impact of global warming on consumer behavior and shifts in international trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has agreed to cap tariffs on European Union pharmaceuticals and semiconductors at 15%, significantly reducing previous threats of rates as high as 250%. This concession is a key detail of the recently announced EU-U.S. trade agreement, which also stipulates that the EU must first pass legislation to reduce its own industrial duties to zero before the 27.5% tariff on European car exports will be lowered to 15%. The deal aims to provide greater predictability for businesses and foster stability in the world's largest trading partnership. However, there was disappointment that sectors like wine and spirits were not included in the tariff exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified an earlier, controversial order regarding stray dogs in New Delhi, now directing authorities to humanely catch, sterilize, and immunize the animals before releasing them, except in cases of rabies infection or aggressive behavior. The court, however, explicitly prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, mandating the establishment of designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action against violators. This revised decision follows an earlier verdict for mass removal due to a significant surge in dog bite cases, with nearly 2,000 incidents reported daily in the capital. The court's aim is to frame a comprehensive nationwide policy, transferring all similar cases to address the complex issue of public safety and animal welfare effectively.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, a figure slightly higher than economists' 3% expectation but representing its lowest level since March, primarily attributed to the easing of rice prices. Headline inflation also decreased to 3.1%, marking its lowest point since November 2024, while the Bank of Japan's closely monitored "core-core" inflation, excluding fresh food and energy, held steady at 3.4%. Despite this moderation, headline inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for 40 consecutive months, prompting some experts to criticize the central bank for being "behind the curve" in raising interest rates and adequately addressing the impact on consumer purchasing power.

The new owners intend to integrate Sikh principles such as discipline, trustfulness, and compassion into the club's operations, aiming to attract fans from the Sikh diaspora and challenge existing narratives about football ownership.

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of insulting the monarchy, a charge that could have led to a 15-year prison sentence. The accusation originated from a 2014 interview where he suggested "some people in the palace" were behind a coup, but the court ruled his statements did not directly name individuals protected by Thailand's strict lese majeste law. This law, often criticized as a political tool to suppress dissent, forbids insulting the monarchy. The verdict brings significant relief to the Shinawatra family, whose political influence faces ongoing challenges, including an upcoming Constitutional Court decision concerning Thaksin's daughter, suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn.</p>

New regulations stipulate that claimants remaining outside the UK for more than eight weeks will generally become ineligible for the benefit, unless exceptional circumstances apply. A newly expanded specialist team, building on a successful pilot that recouped £17 million in under a year, will now utilize international travel data to identify and stop payments to ineligible claimants. This initiative is part of broader government efforts to combat benefit fraud, which has seen an increase since the pandemic, and may soon extend to other benefits claimed overseas.</p>

Their findings revealed a diet consistent with Welsh Palaeozoic rock regions, specifically where bluestones are sourced, providing the first direct evidence linking cattle remains at Stonehenge to Wales. This study further supports the idea that oxen were utilized as beasts of burden, also prompting new questions about the broader community involvement, including women and children, in the monumental task of moving the stones.</p>
