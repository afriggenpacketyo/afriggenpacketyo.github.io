          <p>During a family holiday in the UK, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a private meeting with Conservative shadow secretaries Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp in the Cotswolds. The meeting was arranged by Vance's team and follows a separate discussion he had with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy about international affairs. While Vance's trip includes official engagements, a planned meeting with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch did not occur due to scheduling conflicts. The visit has drawn some local attention due to the heavy security presence in the area for the vice president's stay.</p>

          <p>As retirees face rising living costs, many are considering reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity for financial support. These specialized loans, available to homeowners aged 62 and older, provide cash without requiring monthly payments. While most reverse mortgages are federally regulated and insured by the FHA, they are not without risks. Homeowners must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failing to do so can lead to foreclosure. The article suggests that these loans are safest for seniors planning to remain in their homes long-term and advises careful consideration of all costs and potential scams.

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) secured a significant legal victory when a federal appeals court lifted a preliminary injunction that had blocked its access to certain government data. The ruling by the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals allows DOGE to obtain potentially sensitive information from the Departments of Education and Treasury, as well as the Office of Personnel Management. The data could include Social Security numbers and immigration status. While the case will continue on its merits, this decision is a notable win for the Trump administration's data-sharing initiative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprising, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser. This move comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested that Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors are backing the offer, which is higher than the startup's own valuation. The bid represents a bold step for Perplexity in the competitive AI landscape and puts further pressure on Google following its legal defeat.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been convicted of conspiracy to murder for a failed assassination attempt in Birmingham, UK, in 2019. Hired as a contract killer, Betro attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range, but the gun jammed, allowing the target to escape unharmed. The plot was part of a vendetta by two other men, Mohammed Nazir and Mohammed Aslam, against the victim's family. After the failed shooting, Betro fled the UK and was on the run for nearly five years before being brought to justice.</p>

Financial experts suggest reinvesting the funds in a brokerage account, often using tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to maintain long-term growth. Another popular option for the charitably inclined is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit. For those focused on legacy planning, contributing the RMD proceeds to a 529 college savings plan for family members can also be a beneficial move. (not investment advice)</p>
