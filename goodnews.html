          <p>A woman found deceased in Spain in 2005, known as "the woman in pink," has been identified as Russian national Liudmila Zavada. The breakthrough came through Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which uses modern biometric data and public appeals to solve cold cases involving murdered or suspiciously deceased women in Europe. Zavada's fingerprints, submitted by Spanish police, were matched by authorities in Turkey, and a DNA sample from a relative confirmed her identity. The successful identification highlights the initiative's effectiveness in bringing closure to long-unresolved cases and providing new leads for investigators.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, with the gross domestic product (GDP) expanding at a 3.8% annualized rate, according to the Commerce Department's final revision. This figure is a significant increase from the previous estimate of 3.3% and marks a strong rebound from the first quarter's contraction. The upward revision was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consumer spending, particularly on services, indicating continued resilience among American shoppers despite economic headwinds. This strong performance could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding future interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With children back in school, concerns about head lice infestations are rising, prompting health experts to share prevention and treatment advice. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that up to 12 million infestations occur annually in the U.S., primarily among young children. Lice spread through direct head-to-head contact, not due to poor hygiene, and cannot jump or fly. Prevention methods include avoiding sharing hats and brushes, while treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services. The CDC also clarifies that students with lice do not need to be sent home from school immediately.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the NFL franchise in a deal that values the team at $9 billion. The buyers are reported to be Sixth Street Capital and investor Dean Metropoulos, with the sale pending approval from the NFL's finance committee. This valuation reflects the soaring worth of NFL teams, with similar minority stake sales for other teams also indicating high valuations. The funds from the sale will reportedly be retained on the Patriots' balance sheet, further strengthening the team's financial position.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has produced stunning new images of Sagittarius B2, the most active star-forming region in our galaxy. Located near the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole, this dense molecular cloud is responsible for producing half of the galactic center's stars. Webb's infrared instruments pierced through thick cosmic dust to reveal a colorful landscape of stars and gas in unprecedented detail. The images will help astronomers study the process of star formation and understand why it is relatively low in the galactic center, while also revealing new mysteries about our universe.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests, largely organized by "Gen Z," has shaken Nepal's political establishment, fueled by widespread anger over decades of perceived corruption and inequality. The demonstrations, which turned violent and resulted in dozens of deaths, were initially sparked by social media posts showing the lavish lifestyles of the political elite's children. The unrest led to the resignation of the prime minister and the formation of an interim government. Now, young activists are discussing forming a new political party to challenge the old guard and build a new future for the country.</p>

          <p>First-time claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S. fell to 218,000 last week, a figure significantly lower than economists' expectations and a sign of continued strength in the labor market. This data contrasts with other recent indicators that had suggested a potential weakening, a concern cited by the Federal Reserve in its recent decision to cut interest rates. The report indicates that despite a slowdown in hiring, companies are still hesitant to lay off workers. The resilient labor market, combined with strong GDP growth, suggests the U.S. economy remains on solid footing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The French navy has successfully intercepted a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa, seizing 9.6 tons of cocaine with an estimated street value of over $600 million. The major operation was conducted by two naval ships as part of France's long-standing Corymbe mission, which aims to secure the Gulf of Guinea. The seizure followed a tip from international anti-drug and maritime intelligence agencies, including British police. This bust represents a significant blow to international drug trafficking networks that use West African maritime routes to transport narcotics to Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural analysis suggests that Gen Z has largely abandoned traditional dating models in favor of a more fluid and complex landscape with its own extensive vocabulary. Terms like "situationships" and "sneaky links" describe a variety of casual, often non-committal entanglements where emotional vulnerability is frequently avoided. This shift is attributed to a world shaped by the internet, social media, and a desire for autonomy, creating a wide array of relationship options without a clear guide. While this allows for more personalized paths, it can also lead to stress and confusion in navigating intimacy.</p>

          <p>South America's football governing body, Conmebol, has officially proposed expanding the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams, a significant increase from the 48-team format set for 2026. Proponents argue the expansion would be a fitting way to celebrate the tournament's centenary and would make the event more inclusive. However, the idea has faced opposition from leaders of other confederations, including UEFA, who cite concerns about a decline in competitive quality and logistical chaos. A 64-team tournament would involve 128 matches, raising questions about scheduling, player welfare, and environmental impact.</p>
