          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he threw a fastball clocked at 101.7 mph, the fastest of his major league career, and allowed only one hit and one walk. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in parts of China are reportedly being banned from dining out due to hyper-localized austerity measures that are even more stringent than central government regulations. An official in Sichuan province described the phenomenon as "ceng ceng jia ma," or "adding extra layer upon layer of control," where department heads impose such rules to avoid scrutiny. This lifestyle change reflects the ever-shifting and intense pressure on officials to demonstrate fiscal prudence at all levels of government.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the science behind the "urban heat island effect," a phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, while waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning further elevates temperatures. Conversely, the countryside benefits from the natural cooling effects of vegetation and water. As climate change intensifies heatwaves, this effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>
