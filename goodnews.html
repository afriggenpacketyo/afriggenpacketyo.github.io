          <p>President Trump addressed judicial nominations, emphasizing the need for judges who won't demand trials for every illegal immigrant, citing the burden on the system. He claimed his immigration policy overhaul, a key campaign issue, is being delayed by radicalized judges. Trump asserted the Supreme Court wouldn't allow extensive trials for every criminal entering the country illegally, warning of dire consequences.

          <p>The Department of Justice is suing Colorado and Denver for allegedly interfering with federal immigration enforcement through "sanctuary laws." The lawsuit claims these policies violate the Constitution by hindering ICE's ability to enforce immigration laws. The DOJ argues that Colorado's policies allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to gain control in Aurora. Colorado officials deny being a sanctuary state, stating they cooperate with law enforcement agencies. Republicans in Congress have pressured Democratic-led cities to cooperate with Trump's immigration policies, leading to clashes over immigration reform.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking among OECD members fell to fourth place in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third position. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed mainly to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>
