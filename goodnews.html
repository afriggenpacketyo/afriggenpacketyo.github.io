          <p>A 12-year-old girl, Sophia Forchas, is making a remarkable recovery after being shot in the head during a mass shooting at a Minneapolis church. Her family and medical team at Hennepin Healthcare describe her progress as "nothing short of miraculous," noting steady signs of neurological recovery. While she faces a long journey of rehabilitation, doctors are cautiously optimistic as she prepares to transition from acute care. The attack resulted in the deaths of two other children and injured 18 people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, though the change is marginal. For a 10-year loan, the monthly payment is now approximately $989, while a 15-year term would cost around $779 per month. The article notes that while these costs are lower than earlier in the year, the small difference may not be enough to spur a major rush for homeowners to leverage their equity. It advises homeowners to carefully compare these rates with other borrowing options before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the treaty, for every migrant who crossed by small boat and is returned to France, the UK agrees to accept a refugee who has not made the dangerous journey. This arrival follows the removal of four migrants from the UK to France under the same program. The Home Office stated the policy sends a clear message to people-smuggling gangs, though it has faced criticism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Reese's Halloween-themed candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the actual chocolates lacked the detailed spooky faces, like mouths and eyes, depicted on the wrappers. However, the judge ruled that consumers did not suffer economic harm, as the candy was not rendered "worthless" by the absence of these artistic details. The attorney for the consumers has stated an intention to amend and refile the complaint.</p>

          <p>Laura Gutierrez Vila, a Spanish-born dancer and founder of Laviva Flamenco in Orange County, is preserving and sharing the art of flamenco. Her program teaches students not only the passionate dance style but also its deep cultural roots, which blend influences from Romani, North African, and Latin American traditions. The art form, which incorporates elements like the Peruvian cajón and the Filipino Manton de Manila shawl, serves as a living history of cultural exchange. Through performances and classes, Vila and her group aim to convey the passion and storytelling inherent in this historic Spanish folk art.</p>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, a feat that typically requires humans years of study. Researchers from NYU and GoodFin tested 23 large language models, discovering that top-tier AIs could successfully answer the complex multiple-choice and essay questions of the Level III mock exams in minutes. While this highlights AI's rapid evolution, experts believe the technology will transform the finance industry rather than completely replace human analysts, who excel at understanding context.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who spent 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, will receive a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood. Hastings was exonerated in 2022 after new DNA evidence identified another suspect, Kenneth Packnett, who had died in prison in 2020. A lawsuit revealed that an Inglewood police detective allegedly falsified evidence and ignored information pointing to Packnett at the time of the original investigation. While Hastings stated no money can restore his lost time, the settlement marks an end to his decades-long ordeal.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity rule for "pattern day traders," a move that could make active trading more accessible to retail investors. The long-standing rule, established during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain this minimum balance. It will be replaced with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken during the day, reflecting the evolution of technology and market access. The change is now pending final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the United States unexpectedly jumped 20.5% in August, reaching their fastest pace since early 2022. This surge occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, surprising many economists. Analysts suggest the number may be inflated due to a large margin of error in the survey, though they acknowledge the direction is likely correct, possibly driven by homebuilders offering significant price cuts and incentives. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from nine months in July. (not investment advice)</p>

An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers.

The woman's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but critical evidence, including her remains, went missing from police custody in the 1950s. Investigators recently learned the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery and have now exhumed them. Despite their degraded condition, the remains will undergo advanced forensic testing in the hope that modern science can finally identify the victim.</p>
