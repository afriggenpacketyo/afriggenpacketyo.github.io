          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has discussed a European-led peace initiative for Gaza with U.S. President Donald Trump, following the breakdown of previous U.S.-led negotiations. The plan, developed in collaboration with France and Germany, aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a pathway toward a two-state solution. This diplomatic effort comes amid increasing domestic and international pressure on the UK to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, a move supported by a significant number of MPs.</p>

          <p>Shareholders of the UK financial technology company Wise have approved a proposal to move its primary stock market listing from London to the United States. The company, valued at approximately £11 billion, believes a U.S. listing will increase its visibility in its largest market and provide access to deeper capital pools. The vote was controversial because it was bundled with an extension of a dual-class share structure that enhances the voting power of its co-founder and CEO, Kristo Käärmann.

          <p>The trade relationship between the U.S. and the European Union in 2025 has been marked by significant volatility under President Trump. The year began with the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, prompting the EU to prepare retaliatory measures. After a series of threats, delays, and tense negotiations, the two sides ultimately reached a deal for a single 15% tariff rate on most EU exports, averting a full-scale trade war for the time being.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood clinics. This ruling expands on a previous, more limited injunction and blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting off its Medicaid payments for one year. The judge noted that restricting access to Planned Parenthood's services, which include contraception and STI screenings for low-income patients, would likely lead to adverse public health consequences.</p>

          <p>For individuals cutting back on red meat due to associated health risks like Type 2 diabetes, nutrition experts highlight numerous alternative sources of iron. Registered dietitians recommend plant-based options such as lentils, beans, tofu, and spinach, as well as certain seafoods like oysters and clams. To maximize the body's absorption of iron from plant sources, it is best to pair them with foods rich in vitamin C. Fortified breads and cereals also serve as a significant source of dietary iron in the U.S.</p>
