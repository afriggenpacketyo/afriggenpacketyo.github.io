          <p>Zhao Xintong leads Mark Williams 11-6 after the first day of the World Snooker Championship final. Williams, the oldest Crucible finalist at 50, managed to recover some ground after Zhao dominated the opening session. Zhao, who previously served a ban for involvement in a match-fixing scandal, is aiming to become the first Chinese player to win the title. Williams faces a significant challenge, as no player has overturned a deficit of more than four frames going into the second day of a World final.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on its way to becoming an official city named Starbase, following a vote by local residents, mostly SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase raises concerns about Musk's control over the area, including the potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. SpaceX is seeking federal permission to increase launches from five to 25 per year. Critics worry about the impact on public access and the environment, while SpaceX officials say the city status is needed to manage infrastructure and community services.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is pursuing the creation of its own municipality, Starbase, in South Texas, potentially giving the company greater control over the area near its launch site. The proposal involves incorporating the SpaceX launch site into its own city, with the ability to establish its own fire department, emergency services, and school district.
