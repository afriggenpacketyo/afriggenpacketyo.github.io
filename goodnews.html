          <p>Linwood Riddick, a Vietnam War veteran, graduated from South Carolina State University at the age of 79, fulfilling a long-held ambition inspired by the Orangeburg Massacre of 1968. After retiring from his souvenir business at 72, Riddick enrolled at SC State to honor the students who sacrificed their lives protesting segregation. During the commencement ceremony, Riddick was recognized by the university president for his dedication, as he drove an hour each day to attend classes. He hopes his achievement will inspire others to pursue their dreams regardless of age, demonstrating that it is never too late to learn and grow.</p>

          <p>Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, is competing in the 2025 Miss Maine pageant but is currently trailing Isabelle St. Cyr, the first transgender model to compete in the pageant's history, in the online fan vote. St. Cyr previously won the Miss Monson USA pageant and advocates for trans inclusion in sports, while Hudson is competing to represent Maine fishing families, whose business went bankrupt when she was a child. The online vote page crashed before final results could be tallied, and the winner of the online vote will automatically advance to the pageant's semifinals. This competition takes place amidst ongoing debates regarding trans athletes in women's sports in Maine.</p>

          <p>Margot Friedl√§nder, a Holocaust survivor who spent over six decades in New York City, passed away in Berlin at the age of 103, after returning to Germany in 2010 to share her experiences and promote tolerance.

She dedicated her later years to educating young people about the Holocaust, receiving numerous accolades and even appearing on the cover of German Vogue.

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her death, thanks to advancements in fingerprint technology. Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. A thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the scene was recently matched to Sims through an upgraded F.B.I. database algorithm. Sims, who had a prior conviction for assault and robbery, was extradited from Ohio, and his DNA matched evidence found on Ralston's body.</p>
