          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new $29 billion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, consisting of 96 million restricted stock shares. This move comes six months after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. Analysts suggest the new grant is designed to ensure Musk remains CEO through at least 2030 and to motivate him as the company shifts its focus towards artificial intelligence. The award aims to alleviate shareholder concerns amid recent stock underperformance and increasing competition in the electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were scheduled to take effect this week. This decision follows a July agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at de-escalating trade tensions. The pause is intended to allow for further negotiations to finalize a joint statement and restore stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The original deal involved the EU removing tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and making significant investments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts anticipate that interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its key rate steady. Recent data showing a slight uptick in inflation has created uncertainty about when the Fed might resume rate cuts, prompting many banks to maintain current CD yields. While some institutions have begun to slightly lower their rates in anticipation of future cuts, short-term CDs continue to offer more competitive returns than long-term ones. Experts advise savers to compare offers from different banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade-long investigation, marine ecologists have identified the cause of sea star wasting disease, a devastating illness that has killed millions of sea stars along North America's West Coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacterium, *Vibrio pectenicida*, which causes the stars' limbs to detach before they disintegrate. The discovery is a major breakthrough, as the mass die-off of the sunflower sea star led to ecological imbalances like urchin population explosions and the collapse of kelp forests. Researchers are hopeful that knowing the cause will enable them to develop effective strategies for restoration.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's potential acquisition of Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak may be financially linked to the sale of their own forward, Darwin Nunez, to the Saudi Pro League. Intermediaries are reportedly working on a deal for Nunez to join Al-Hilal, a club also controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which owns a majority stake in Newcastle. While Newcastle rejected an initial £110m bid for Isak, a sale of Nunez would provide Liverpool with significant funds. The situation raises questions among some fans about whether PIF is prioritizing one of its clubs over another.</p>

          <p>India defeated England by just six runs in a dramatic conclusion to the fifth Test at The Oval, leveling the series 2-2. The final day's play lasted only 57 minutes, with the match culminating in a tense chase where England needed 35 runs and India required four wickets. England's hopes were briefly raised by an injured Chris Woakes, who bravely came out to bat with a dislocated shoulder, but Gus Atkinson was ultimately bowled attempting a six that would have tied the scores. The thrilling finale marked the narrowest Test win in England since the 2005 Ashes.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu is partnering with U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft to launch its autonomous robotaxi service in Europe, starting in 2026. The driverless vehicles will initially be deployed in the United Kingdom and Germany, with plans to expand to thousands of cars across the continent in subsequent years. This move marks a significant international expansion for Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi service, which already operates in several Chinese cities. For Lyft, which recently acquired European ride-hailing company FreeNow, the partnership could significantly boost its presence and competitiveness against rivals like Uber in the European market, pending regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>Everton has reached an agreement with Chelsea to sign midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for a deal worth approximately £28 million. The fee includes an initial £24 million with up to £4 million in add-ons. The 26-year-old is now set to finalize personal terms and undergo a medical. Chelsea was reportedly open to the sale as they aim to recoup most of the £30 million they paid Leicester City for the player in 2024. The move is part of a broader effort by Chelsea to trim their squad, with several other players also in negotiations for transfers to other clubs.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK car buyers who used financing over the past 18 years could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on undisclosed commissions. The ruling found that failure by dealers to properly disclose the commission they received from lenders could be deemed unfair and unlawful, particularly in cases involving discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), which were banned in 2021. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is establishing a compensation scheme, with the first payments expected in 2026. For now, consumers are advised to wait for the official scheme rather than using claims management companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of early August, average interest rates for home equity borrowing options remain significantly lower than for personal loans or credit cards, making them an attractive choice for homeowners. The average rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.41%, while the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is 8.26%. These products allow homeowners to borrow against their property's value, which currently averages over $300,000 in the U.S. While home equity loans offer a lump sum with a fixed rate, HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and former congressman, against NBCUniversal. The suit concerned comments made by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in 2021 about Nunes's handling of a package from a sanctioned pro-Russia Ukrainian legislator. Maddow had stated that Nunes refused to hand the package over to the FBI. The judge ruled that no reasonable jury could find that Maddow acted with "actual malice," as Nunes failed to provide clear evidence that she had a high degree of awareness that her statement was probably false.</p>

          <p>NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff will move to MSNBC full-time following the cable channel's spinoff into a new, stand-alone company called Versant. The separation means MSNBC will no longer share editorial resources with NBC News, and talent will generally have to choose one entity. Soboroff is one of the highest-profile names to choose the cable side, a surprising move given that the spinoff is occurring because of the challenging future facing the pay-TV industry. The move reflects an aggressive hiring push by Versant, which is also attracting talent from other major news organizations like CNN and the New York Times.</p>
