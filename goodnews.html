          <p>The U.S. and U.K. have reached a trade agreement, but it includes a 10% baseline tariff on most goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K., signaling that tariffs are here to stay under the Trump administration. The deal allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, while steel and aluminum exports will be tariff-free. Analysts interpret the agreement as indicating that a 10% minimum tariff will likely be applied to other trading partners, with potential flexibility on sectoral tariffs. The article notes that the auto sector carve-out benefits automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are projected to significantly increase the cost of baby products, potentially adding up to $1,000 a year for new parents, according to industry players. The tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, are raising prices on essentials like car seats and strollers. While the White House considers a "baby bonus" to encourage more births, advocates are calling for tariff exemptions on critical baby products. Resale platforms are seeing increased demand as parents seek ways to save money amid rising costs.</p>

He also questioned the decision-making of the team's chief baseball officer, Craig Breslow, and suggested the team should look to the free agent market to fill the first base position.

          <p>President Trump has voiced tepid support for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while simultaneously advising Republicans against it. This comes after Trump contacted House Speaker Mike Johnson about including a tax hike on high earners in the GOP's tax and spending bill. Trump acknowledged potential political backlash, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise, but ultimately stated he would be okay with Republicans pursuing the tax increase. He suggested that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would try to use this as a point of attack.</p>
