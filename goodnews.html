Sources indicate the couple is "happier than ever" and actively planning for their future, with de Ramon consistently accompanying Pitt on his film promotional tours, including their first public appearance at the 2024 British Grand Prix. She also provided substantial emotional support to Pitt following the loss of his mother, Jane Etta Pittt, in August, demonstrating a deep bond. The article highlights their evolving relationship, which began in 2022 after Pitt's divorce from Angelina Jolie, and their recent move into a new house.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Luke Littler secured a spot in the World Grand Prix Darts semi-finals by defeating Gerwyn Price in a dramatic quarter-final match held in Leicester. The reigning world champion overcame a two-set deficit against the 2020 World Grand Prix winner, delivering a sensational 152 checkout in the deciding leg to clinch the victory. Price, who missed three match darts in the fourth set, graciously applauded Littler's impressive comeback. Littler expressed his strategy of switching to double 16s, a key finish that previously helped him win the World Championship, proving crucial once again.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with AstraZeneca, a U.K.-based pharmaceutical giant, to significantly lower drug prices in the United States. Under this deal, AstraZeneca will sell its primary care medications directly to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed countries, known as "most-favored nation" pricing, via a new government website, TrumpRx.gov. In return, the company will be exempt from pharmaceutical sector tariffs, contingent on its commitment to invest $50 billion in U.S. manufacturing by 2030. This initiative follows a similar pact with Pfizer, as the administration continues to pressure drugmakers to reduce sky-high costs for medicines.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the nation is signaling a strategic shift towards attracting "high-quality" foreign investment, moving away from a previous emphasis on sheer quantity. Local officials are now explicitly seeking projects in strategic sectors such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and artificial intelligence, particularly in prosperous regions like the Yangtze River Delta. This new approach aims to help complete and develop local supply chains and enhance China's technological and industrial capabilities. The change indicates a more selective and targeted engagement with foreign capital, reflecting high-level policy priorities for future development.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially come into effect, leading to a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza and the return of thousands of Palestinians to the northern region. The agreement, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, involves the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, along with unrestricted aid into the Strip, with 600 lorries expected daily. While the first phase of the deal is underway, the next stages of disarmament and demilitarization are still under negotiation, and Hamas has rejected any "foreign guardianship" of Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Conditions on Domestic Violence Grants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 17:07:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from imposing controversial conditions on grants for domestic violence programs. These conditions included prohibitions on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, or providing abortion resources. The ruling states that such conditions would cause "irreparable harm" by disrupting vital services to victims of homelessness and domestic and sexual violence, and forcing organizations to compromise their values. The judge's decision applies broadly to all applicants for funding from the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Health and Human Services, affirming that these grants exist to serve people in need.</p>

          <p>The German national football team achieved a dominant 4-0 victory over Luxembourg in a World Cup qualifier, a performance deemed both expected and necessary for the squad to regain fan credit. The match in Sinsheim, Julian Nagelsmann's former Bundesliga coaching ground, was significantly aided by Luxembourg playing an hour with 10 men after an early red card. Despite the opponent's disadvantage, Germany showed improved hunger and intensity, securing a crucial win that helps them in their quest for the top spot in the group, especially after a troubling start to World Cup qualifying.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what the White House described as a "routine yearly checkup," just six months after his previous annual physical exam. The White House did not provide an explanation for the second checkup, which occurred ahead of a potential trip to the Middle East to discuss a peace deal. Trump, 79, stated he felt "in great shape" both physically and mentally, despite being seen with swollen ankles and a bruised hand recently. His April medical records had indicated no abnormalities aside from minor sun damage and scarring from an assassination attempt.</p>

          <p>Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend is vigorously defending his new, controversial consultancy role with Red Bull, asserting it will ultimately benefit his coaching for the national team. Despite criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest and distraction from his primary duties, Townsend maintains he is "all-in" with Scotland Rugby and will prioritize national team commitments. He argues the maximum 30-day consultancy provides invaluable access to world-leading sports organizations like Formula One and football, enhancing his development as a coach and, by extension, the team's performance. Townsend believes this unique learning opportunity will strengthen Scotland, which he claims is currently in its best position.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an agreement to establish a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. This new facility will enable Qatari F-15 pilots to train alongside American military personnel, aiming to enhance combined training, increase lethality, and improve interoperability between the two nations. The agreement signifies a deepening relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar, following previous diplomatic developments. These include the president's executive order "assuring the security of the state of Qatar" and the acceptance of a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the Qatari government, despite some criticism.</p>
