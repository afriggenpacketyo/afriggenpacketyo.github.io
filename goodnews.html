          <p>Donald Trump stated that the U.S. would cease attacks on the Houthis in Yemen, citing their alleged capitulation and a ceasefire agreement mediated by Oman, which ensures freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait. The Houthis began targeting shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, leading to U.S.-led naval forces thwarting attacks and intensifying air strikes under both Joe Biden and Trump. Trump said the Houthis announced they no longer want to fight, and he would honor that. In recent developments, Israel responded to Houthi missile attacks with strikes on Yemen's main international airport and other facilities.</p>

          <p>Utah has become the first state in the U.S. to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite opposition from dentists and health experts. Republican Governor Spencer Cox signed the law, influenced by claims that fluoride can have harmful effects, though health officials dispute these claims. The ban will affect about 1.6 million people in northern Utah, with dentists bracing for an increase in tooth decay, especially among children and low-income residents. Dentists in Salt Lake City say they can tell where someone grew up based on the level of decay in their teeth, indicating the impact of fluoridated water.</p>

          <p>This article discusses options when debt collectors refuse settlement offers, noting that rejection doesn't end the negotiation. Debt collectors may refuse offers they deem too low or if they believe the debtor can pay more. Strategies to improve settlement chances include doing homework on the debt, offering proof of hardship, and working with a debt relief expert. It emphasizes patience and persistence in negotiations. The article also states that debt collectors aren't legally required to settle for less than what's owed, but it does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of approximately 14% on Tuesday, despite the data analytics and artificial intelligence software company showcasing ongoing revenue growth acceleration. CEO Alex Karp defended the company, stating that Palantir is "pretty happy" and investors are not obligated to buy their shares. The decline was attributed to concerns over declining international revenue and failure to meet high growth expectations. Despite this, Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and increased its revenue guidance for the year, reporting adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues.</p>

Economists project a 97% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The Fed's decision comes amid mixed signals from the U.S. economy, including negative GDP growth in the first quarter and strong job growth in April.
