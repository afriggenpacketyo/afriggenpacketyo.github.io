        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has surprised observers with a notably defensive approach in recent Premier League matches, including a game against Arsenal where his team registered a record-low 34% possession. This tactical shift, which saw City playing with more defenders and focusing on counter-attacks, marks a radical departure from his signature possession-based style. Guardiola attributed the change to facing "one of the best teams in Europe," sparking debate over whether it reflects Arsenal's strength or a lack of trust in his squad's traditional play. This new strategy suggests a broader shift towards caution in top-tier football.</p>

This decision, which followed a request from the National Council for Human Rights and international pressure, will lead to his release from Wadi al-Natrun prison. Abdel Fattah, a prominent pro-democracy blogger, was arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news." His family, who campaigned tirelessly for his freedom, expressed immense relief at the news.</p>

          <p>China's soybean imports reached historically high levels in August, driven by massive purchases from Brazil and other South American countries. This strategic move is seen as Beijing's preparation for a prolonged trade standoff with the United States. Brazil accounted for over 85% of these imports, benefiting from a bumper crop. China has now recorded four consecutive months of record soybean imports, aiming to hedge against potential supply uncertainties from the US in the fourth quarter due to ongoing trade disputes.</p>

Her routine includes avoiding digital devices for the first 30 minutes, hydrating with warm salt water and citrus, exposing her eyes to natural light, and engaging in gentle movement. These practices, informed by neuroscience, aim to improve energy, focus, mood, and sleep by positively influencing the brain's prefrontal cortex and circadian rhythm. Wood emphasizes that these habits significantly prime her brain for the day.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are challenging expected claims from the Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism in children. Leading organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state there is no clear evidence for such a direct causal link, emphasizing that neurodevelopmental disorders are multifactorial. Kenvue, Tylenol's maker, asserts continuous evaluation confirms no causal link and highlights acetaminophen as the safest pain reliever for pregnant women. Experts caution against frightening pregnant patients away from a safe option, stressing the importance of consulting OB-GYNs for guidance.</p>

This decline was largely offset by significant increases in purchases from other partners, including a 50.4% jump from Brazil and a nearly 90-fold increase from Indonesia. Analysts are divided on whether this shift is a temporary fluctuation, possibly due to maintenance at Russian production sites, or a broader trend towards diversifying China's energy supply.
