          <p>The U.S. government has acquired an approximately 10% equity stake in Intel, converting billions in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into ownership. This strategic move aims to enhance domestic semiconductor production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC, particularly amid geopolitical tensions with China. The investment is intended to secure national security systems and prevent supply chain shocks. While proponents see it as a necessary step to compete with subsidized foreign industries, the deal has raised concerns about potential political interference in Intel's corporate decision-making.

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. At 19, he is now second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, making him the likely future emperor of Japan. His ceremony has reignited the long-standing debate over the country's male-only succession law, as there are no other young male heirs. This rule excludes Emperor Naruhito's daughter, Princess Aiko, from the line of succession, prompting ongoing discussions about whether to allow female monarchs or reintegrate distant male relatives to ensure the monarchy's continuation.</p>

          <h2>Remembering Rene Higuita's Iconic Scorpion Kick, 30 Years Later</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed his legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. The audacious maneuver, where he cleared the ball by kicking it over his back with his heels, cemented his reputation as one of football's most flamboyant and unconventional players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the sweeper-keeper role, famous for his risk-taking dribbles far outside his penalty area. His career was as colorful off the pitch as on it, including a prison sentence for his involvement in a kidnapping case linked to Pablo Escobar.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the protections was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded her authority. The ruling safeguards the legal status of approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians, allowing them to continue living and working in the U.S. The judge criticized the administration for attempting to send people back to countries that the State Department considers dangerously unstable.</p>
