          <h2>Trump Publicly Mulls Tax Increase on Wealthy Americans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump took to Truth Social to consider raising taxes on wealthy Americans, a move that would deviate from traditional Republican tax policy. He acknowledged the political challenges, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise. Trump expressed openness to the idea to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but also cautioned against potential backlash from Democrats. The post puts pressure on GOP leaders already struggling to balance tax cuts with fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China from 145% to 80% ahead of trade negotiations, but analysts suggest this may not significantly ease price increases for consumers. While it could prevent a complete trade standstill, an 80% tariff would still be a substantial tax on imports. Companies like Mattel have warned of potential price increases and supply chain shifts due to the tariffs. The move comes after weeks of conflicting signals and uncertainty regarding trade policy.</p>

          <p>The US-UK trade deal on steel tariffs includes conditions on the ownership of British steel plants to prevent Chinese-owned plants from circumventing US tariffs. The agreement aims to ensure that the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe is not used as a backdoor for Chinese steel. The deal is expected to reduce car tariffs to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if certain requirements are met, potentially saving jobs in the car and steel industries. The US is focusing on the security of supply chains and the nature of ownership in defining the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free.</p>
