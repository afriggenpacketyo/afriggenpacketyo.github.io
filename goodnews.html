        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform from Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to emphasize quality over quantity, focusing on distinct and great programming for adults and families, a strategy similar to Disney's approach. CEO David Zaslav stated the move is to bring back HBO, a brand representing the highest quality in media, to accelerate growth. The streaming business has improved its profitability significantly, adding around 22 million subscribers in the last year, with a goal of over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence researcher Shen, now an associate professor at an elite university in eastern China, finds himself spending less time on research due to administrative duties. Young researchers are under pressure to produce immediate results, hindering their ability to pursue bold, exploratory projects. A competitive tenure and funding system, based on factors like awards, further discourages long-term investments in original ideas. Shen's experience reflects a broader concern that practical constraints are stifling innovation in Chinese academia, despite researchers' passion for their work.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 27% in the past year, reaching the lowest levels since 2019, according to a CDC report. The report indicates a drop from 110,037 deaths in 2023 to 80,391 in 2024, with the largest decrease seen in fatalities linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Experts attribute this decline to the widespread use of naloxone, increased access to medications for opioid use disorder, and greater public awareness of the dangers of opioid use. Despite the positive trend, experts caution against complacency and emphasize the need for continued efforts to combat the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>A European court ruled that the European Commission must provide a more detailed explanation for denying a journalist's request for text messages between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO regarding COVID-19 vaccine access. The case, brought by The New York Times, questioned whether the text messages were covered by EU transparency laws. The court stated the commission failed to adequately explain why it couldn't find the messages or why they wouldn't contain important information. The ruling is seen as a victory for transparency and accountability within the European Union, emphasizing that digital communications are not beyond public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>With gold prices rising amid economic uncertainty, investors are turning to the precious metal for portfolio diversification. Experts recommend considering gold's price in context, understanding different investment types like physical gold and ETFs, and looking at liquidity. Physical gold provides direct ownership but requires storage and insurance, while ETFs offer easier trading. Investors should also be tax-aware, as physical gold is taxed as a collectible. Experts emphasize the importance of having a strategy when including gold in a portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

The agency cites concerns that ingested fluoride can alter the gut microbiome and may be linked to thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports the move, while dental experts largely disagree, citing decades of data showing fluoride's safety and effectiveness in preventing cavities. For now, parents can still use fluoride toothpastes, mouthwashes, and dentist-applied varnishes.</p>
