          <p>China's central bank is intensifying efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency, citing growing concerns over the stability of the U.S. dollar as an opportunity for expansion. The bank has outlined plans to increase the yuan's role in international trade and finance, strengthen offshore markets, and enhance its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This renewed focus on internationalization, marked by a dedicated section in the central bank's midyear meeting summary for the first time in three years, signals a strategic push to establish the yuan as a more significant player in the global financial system.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has allocated an extra £100 million to intensify efforts against illegal people-smuggling gangs operating in the English Channel, following a record number of crossings this year. The new funding will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 more officers and advanced technology to disrupt the criminal networks. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the investment would help to better track and dismantle the gangs. The government is also pursuing a pilot returns scheme with France and plans to introduce new legislation criminalizing the online advertisement of illegal crossings.</p>

          <p>Kate Forbes, Scotland's Deputy First Minister, has announced that she will not stand for re-election in the 2026 Holyrood election, citing a desire to spend more time with her young family. First elected in 2016, Forbes had a swift political ascent, becoming finance secretary in 2020 and later deputy to First Minister John Swinney. In her resignation letter, she emphasized the demanding nature of her role and her wish not to miss more of her daughter's early years. Swinney praised her invaluable contribution to public life and confirmed she will continue in her government role until the election.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 1,000 Americans reveals the deep emotional connection people have with their pets, with some bonds extending into hypothetical romance. Following a viral trend where AI reimagines pets as people, 31% of owners said they would be willing to date the human version of their animal companion. The survey also highlighted that many people find more emotional support from their pets than from human relationships, with 77% stating their pet provides better support than an ex-partner. This strong attachment influences major life decisions, including housing, vacation planning, and romantic partnerships.</p>

          <p>A pit bull is being hailed as a hero in Pittsburgh after it crossed a busy street to get help for its two owners, who were found unresponsive in a tent encampment. A local man, Gary Thynes, was at a park when the barking dog persistently led him to a secluded area where he discovered an unconscious man and woman. Thynes called 911, and first responders transported the pair to the hospital. He has since agreed to foster the dog until its owners recover, an experience he described as surreal and reaffirming his faith.</p>

          <p>A new federal report on drug use and health has revealed a promising trend, showing a decline in depression and suicidal behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The analysis found that serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12 to 17 fell from nearly 13% to 10%, with a slight drop in suicide attempts as well. Experts suggest that increased openness and better access to specialized treatment may be contributing factors. However, advocates note that millions of teens still experience suicidal thoughts and that significant barriers to accessing mental healthcare persist for many Americans.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Tonight in Jungleland," reveals the intense pressure and creative struggles Bruce Springsteen faced while making his landmark 1975 album, "Born to Run." At risk of being dropped by his record label, Springsteen labored for months, driven by perfectionism that nearly derailed the project. The book details how critic-turned-producer Jon Landau was pivotal in shaping the album, including refining the classic song "Thunder Road." It also recounts Springsteen's initial dissatisfaction with the final record, culminating in him famously throwing an acetate copy into a hotel swimming pool before its release vaulted him to superstardom.</p>

          <p>Beyond its well-known C919 airliner, China is making significant progress in developing its own aviation supply chain to reduce reliance on foreign technology. A key project is the CJ-1000A jet engine, which is reportedly progressing on schedule and is intended to eventually replace the foreign-made engines currently used on the C919. A senior engineer from the Chinese Academy of Engineering provided a rare positive update on the engine's development. This push for self-sufficiency in critical components represents a major step in Beijing's long-term strategy to become a dominant force in the global civil aviation industry.</p>
