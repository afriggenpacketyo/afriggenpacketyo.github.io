          <p>President Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, expressing a belief that a resolution will eventually materialize despite current setbacks and mounting uncertainty. He emphasized his unique diplomatic approach, which involves bringing warring leaders into direct, real-time negotiations to forge agreements, a strategy he credits with successfully ending several conflicts during his previous term. While acknowledging that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are "not ready yet," Trump remains optimistic that "something is going to happen" to end the conflict, even amidst intensified Russian aggression and missile attacks. He stated his focus is on saving lives, not seeking accolades like the Nobel Peace Prize, as he monitors the leaders' handling of this critical crossroads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets predominantly saw increases on Thursday, buoyed by an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite higher, even as broader economic anxieties persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose by 1.26%, though Kyoto-based Nidec Corp's shares plunged sharply after the company announced an investigation into alleged improper accounting. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.64%, reflecting a 0.5% month-on-month rise in household spending for July, marking the fastest yearly growth since November 2023. Global bond markets, however, remained a focus of concern, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassing 5% following a court ruling on Trump's tariffs, raising questions about future revenue.

          <p>Jannik Sinner continued his impressive US Open title defense by decisively defeating fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals, securing his spot in the semi-finals with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory. Sinner, lauded for his consistent and powerful play, extended his remarkable streak to 26 consecutive hard-court Grand Slam match wins. Musetti, ranked 10th, struggled to convert any of his seven break points and was outmatched by his compatriot's 28 winners on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Sinner expressed satisfaction with his "very solid" performance, setting up a semi-final clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who defeated Alex de Minaur.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre reveals that ordinary Chinese citizens hold nuanced and flexible views regarding US rivalry and their nation's alliances with Russia and North Korea. While respondents are optimistic about China's future, economy, and military, a plurality of 48% expressed interest in a shared leadership role with the United States, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence rather than outright dominance. Experts suggest these findings offer potential avenues to reduce US-China tensions, despite an underlying skepticism among the Chinese public about American intentions and a strong sense of national pride displayed during recent military parades.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to host a high-profile dinner for two dozen prominent tech and business leaders, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and Microsoft's Bill Gates, in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden. This inaugural event will follow a separate artificial intelligence gathering hosted by First Lady Melania Trump. The meeting underscores the complex yet increasingly collaborative relationship between the Trump administration and the Big Tech sector, as many executives seek to foster friendlier ties and align with the administration's goals on emerging technologies and American reshoring initiatives. Key figures like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sergey Brin are also among the invitees.</p>

The training program covers critical areas including safety management, airworthiness certification, green development, and new technologies, reflecting China's strategic push to enhance its influence in the regional aviation market. This effort seeks to challenge the long-standing duopoly of Airbus and Boeing, as Southeast Asia increasingly becomes a significant recipient of Chinese aircraft deliveries.

Sununu is seriously exploring a bid to return to the Senate in New Hampshire, with reports indicating senior White House officials have given their blessing to a potential campaign. The open seat, left by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's decision not to seek re-election in 2026, presents a significant opportunity for Republicans in a state that has historically been challenging for the party in Senate contests. Sununu, part of the influential Sununu political dynasty, stated he will make a decision by the end of next month, aiming to build a strong team and appeal broadly across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during World War Two, has been successfully recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his death while escaping in 1940, after which his collection was seized. The painting was discovered after being spotted in an online real estate listing by Dutch journalists researching a Nazi lawyer who had escaped to Argentina. Authorities have since conducted raids, seizing other suspected stolen artworks and placing the lawyer's daughter under house arrest on charges of concealment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's $2.2 billion funding freeze for Harvard University, ruling it an "ideologically-motivated assault" and a violation of First Amendment rights. The decision stated the administration used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" for broader ideological concerns, swiftly terminating grants after Harvard refused demands regarding diversity programs and student screening. The freeze had halted critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis and NASA astronauts' radiation exposure. While acknowledging Harvard's need to address antisemitism more effectively, the judge found little genuine connection between the research affected and the administration's stated concerns, affirming the university's academic freedom.</p>
