          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after being on the political sidelines for years. However, the KMT faces an immediate threat: a mass-recall campaign orchestrated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which could jeopardize its legislative majority. Analysts suggest that failure to address the recall challenge could disrupt the leadership transition and fracture the party. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down after his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor, with the party chair race set to be announced in July.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Opinion columnist Ross Douthat argues that Donald Trump's political resilience is partly due to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, a strategy encapsulated by the Wall Street acronym "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out). This perceived flexibility reassures swing voters that any extreme positions are provisional and subject to change. Douthat suggests that Trump's recent shifts on China tariffs, his distancing from Elon Musk, and his complaints about Vladimir Putin have helped improve his poll numbers. He argues that voters appreciate Trump's pressure on institutions they distrust, but also expect him to accept counterpressure and retreat when necessary.</p>

          <p>The Mississippi town of Clarksdale is experiencing a resurgence of attention thanks to the box office success of Ryan Coogler's film "Sinners," which grossed over $300 million globally. The film, set in 1932 Clarksdale, tells the story of twin brothers returning home after World War One, blending elements of musicals, horror, and period drama. Coogler conducted extensive research in Clarksdale, and locals appreciate his respectful portrayal of their history and culture. The film's success has prompted Coogler to bring the film to Clarksdale for free screenings, addressing the town's lack of a movie theater since 2003, and residents hope the spotlight will boost tourism and understanding of the town's rich blues music heritage.</p>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes is set to come into effect across the UK on Sunday, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. The ban means that shops and supermarkets will no longer be able to stock disposable vapes, although they can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices. Disposable vapes have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping, with millions of vapes being thrown away annually. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, the long-term risks are still unknown, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping.</p>
