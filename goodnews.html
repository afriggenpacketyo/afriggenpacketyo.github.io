          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "bags fly free" policy by implementing a $35 fee for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, effective for flights booked on or after May 28th. Certain customers, including Business Select/Choice Extra and A-List Preferred members, will receive two free checked bags, while A-List and Chase Rapid Reward credit card members will get one free bag. The airline is also changing its flight credit policy, with credits issued on or after May 28th expiring in six months to a year, depending on the fare type, ending the previous policy of never-expiring credits. This decision was announced in March following pressure from activist investors to improve financial performance, and the airline's stock price increased by 2.1% in pre-trading.

          <p>Former President Trump is reportedly planning to pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of the reality TV show "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. The White House announced Trump's intention to pardon the couple, who gained fame for showcasing their luxurious lifestyle on their USA Network series. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, shared news of the pardon on Instagram, expressing gratitude to Trump for his administration's support, while claiming her family was persecuted by rogue prosecutors due to their public profile and conservative beliefs. The Chrisleys were convicted on charges stemming from a scheme to submit fake financial statements to obtain millions of dollars in loans.</p>

          <p>Arne Slot, the new Liverpool boss, expressed gratitude for the support from "the wider football community" following an incident at Liverpool's title parade, where a car rammed into crowds, injuring around 50 people. Slot was named manager of the year and Premier League manager of the year at the League Managers Association (LMA) awards, but did not attend the ceremony out of solidarity with those affected. Having replaced Jurgen Klopp last summer, the 46-year-old only signed one player - forward Federico Chiesa - but still delivered Liverpool's second Premier League title, winning the league by 10 points from Arsenal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the deportation of Eyidi Ambila, a Maine resident from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who alleges he was illegally detained by ICE for eight months. Ambila was moved to a Massachusetts jail before the judge issued the emergency ruling, preventing his deportation. The ACLU filed a habeas corpus petition on Ambila's behalf, arguing that ICE had held him illegally without providing information about their plans. The judge cited the lack of evidence that the Democratic Republic of Congo would accept Ambila, as previous attempts to deport him have failed since 2007.</p>

Energy companies are paying out more ¬£70m in compensation and financial support to customers, following a review by Ofgem, of the way suppliers switched often vulnerable customers to paying upfront, without their agreement, after they fell behind with their bills. The payouts apply to customers at eight suppliers, and investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo, representing tens of thousands more customers.</p>

          <p>Kelly Wakefield, a gardener, discovered a metal box containing coins, antiques, a Civil War-era bullet, a map, and a note in a St. Albans, Vermont, park. The treasure was intentionally hidden by Michael Cloherty O‚ÄôConnell, the author of history books that lead readers on scavenger hunts. O'Connell, a retired history buff, used his retirement funds to create the hunts, hoping to engage readers with American history. The hidden chests contain antiques worth upwards of $100,000, and Wakefield, already familiar with the park's history and geocaching, plans to continue treasure hunting.</p>

This ruling marks the third time this month that a federal judge in Washington has rejected Trump's series of law firm executive orders. Judge Richard Leon emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, and stated that allowing the order to stand would be unfaithful to the Founding Fathers. The order against WilmerHale cited the firm's previous employment of former special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>
