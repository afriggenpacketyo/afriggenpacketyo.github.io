          <h2>Effective Communication Strategies for Parents to Foster Cooperation in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 12:56:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests using specific phrases to encourage cooperation from children instead of triggering their fight-or-flight responses. Traditional parenting phrases like "Because I said so" or threats can be counterproductive, but language that respects a child's autonomy and sets clear boundaries can lead to better outcomes. The recommended phrases focus on explaining reasons, giving children agency within limits, acknowledging their emotions, and inviting problem-solving instead of blame. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase their defense spending to 5% of their respective GDPs, a target advocated by the U.S. for some time. Spain initially opposed the measure but later conceded after securing an exemption. Formal adoption of the agreement is expected during the upcoming NATO meeting in The Hague, with all member nations except Spain having until 2035 to meet the 5% target. The spending will be divided, with at least 3.5% allocated to core military needs and an additional 1.5% for related expenditures.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, authorities report no signs of off-site radiation or contamination, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that no health consequences for people or the environment outside the targeted sites are expected at this time. The three sites hit contained uranium enriched to different levels, but experts suggest that the materials involved pose a low hazard regarding radioactive materials. Neighboring countries, including Kuwait, have also reported no abnormal radiation levels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Owners of Maui short-term vacation rentals claim that local residents cannot afford the rent if 6,100 units are converted into long-term housing, but a University of Hawaii study suggests otherwise. The study indicates that over 11,600 Maui households already spend 30% of their income on housing and could afford to move into converted units. The analysis also reveals that converting vacation rentals would lower housing costs for residents due to declining property values and taxes. The Maui County Council's Housing and Land Use Committee will consider these competing claims as they continue hearings on the proposed bill.</p>
