          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez held their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of celebrity guests like Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The lavish, multi-day event sparked some local protests from the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, which cited concerns over over-tourism and rising costs in the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S√°nchez, 55, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019. The festivities appeared to proceed without disruption despite the local opposition.</p>

          <p>Authorities have recaptured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago in a major jailbreak. The escape, which involved inmates climbing through a hole behind a toilet, went unnoticed for hours and has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management. With Massey's arrest, only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, remains at large. Over a dozen individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump expressed optimism that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could be achieved "within the next week." This statement comes as the administration has been pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023. A previous 60-day ceasefire proposal was reportedly supported by Israel but met with amendments from Hamas that the U.S. deemed unacceptable. The war has resulted in a significant number of casualties on both sides, with over 56,000 killed in Gaza according to its Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record high of 6,173, recovering completely from a sharp downturn in April that was triggered by concerns over the Trump administration's tariff policies. Investor optimism has been fueled by signs of easing global trade tensions and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The Nasdaq also set a new record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose but remained below its previous peak. Despite the strong rebound, some analysts warn of complacency regarding trade issues and note that inflation rose slightly in May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration executive order that sought to punish the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling the directive was unconstitutional. The order was one of several targeting major law firms perceived as political enemies of the president, aiming to impact their clients, security clearances, and access to federal buildings. The judge stated the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments and threatened the independence of the legal profession. Susman Godfrey had represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News over false 2020 election claims.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman, who once recommended a low single-digit allocation to cryptocurrency, now suggests that investors could consider holding 10% to 40% of their portfolios in crypto. He attributes this major shift in his thinking to the evolution of the crypto industry, which he now views as a mainstream asset class. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio is becoming obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating assets with higher potential returns. He notes that crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets makes it a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

The company will also eliminate synthetic dyes from products sold to K-12 schools a year earlier. While many of its core products like Uncrustables are already free of these dyes, some items, including sugar-free jams and certain Hostess snacks acquired in 2023, still contain them. This move aligns Smucker with other major food companies like Nestle and General Mills, which have made similar pledges amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of artificial food additives.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have voted to more than double the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as other states and countries lure productions away with more generous incentives. The expansion aims to bring productions back to California and revitalize the local industry, which has been hit hard by strikes and out-of-state competition. Governor Gavin Newsom had called for the expansion to ensure the state remains competitive.</p>
