          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and China have signed a trade agreement, formalizing a framework established in previous talks in London and Geneva. While details were not immediately provided by the White House, the deal aims to de-escalate the trade war that has seen massive tariff hikes. China's Commerce Ministry confirmed it would accelerate the approval of export licenses for rare earth minerals, a key point of contention for the U.S. The agreement comes as both economies show signs of strain from the ongoing trade dispute, impacting factory profits in China and contributing to economic contraction in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The White House has signaled that President Donald Trump may extend the 90-day pause on so-called reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire in early July. A spokesperson stated that the deadline is "not critical," suggesting flexibility as negotiations continue with key partners. The comment came as Japan's chief tariff negotiator was in Washington for another round of talks with U.S. officials. This potential extension provides breathing room for negotiators from both countries as they work to resolve ongoing trade disputes and avoid the re-imposition of damaging economic penalties.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that its global sales in May increased by 6.9% compared to the previous year, reaching a record 898,721 units for the month. The company attributed the strong performance partly to a surge in last-minute demand in the United States. This spike in U.S. sales was driven by consumer concerns that vehicle prices could increase due to high tariffs recently imposed by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Toyota's global production saw a slight dip of 0.7%, marking the first year-on-year monthly decline in five months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese city of Chongqing is experiencing a tourism boom, particularly from Southeast Asia, fueled by viral social media clips showcasing its unique "cyberpunk" architecture and landscape. Online travel platforms report a massive surge in bookings, with some seeing a nearly 12-fold increase in demand for the city. Young travelers are drawn to sights like a monorail passing through a residential building and the city's multi-dimensional, hilly terrain.
