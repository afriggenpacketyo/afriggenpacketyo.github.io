          <p>Japan's core inflation rate for July cooled to 3.1%, down from 3.3% in June, primarily due to easing rice prices which had previously skyrocketed. Despite the decrease, the figure was higher than economists' expectations and marked the 40th consecutive month inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. This sustained inflation is increasing pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates from their current low levels to stabilize the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The operation involved the eradication of nearly 2,400 plants and the cleanup of approximately 2,000 pounds of trash and hazardous materials. The illegal grow site caused significant environmental damage, including diverting a creek, clearing vegetation, and contaminating the soil with banned, highly toxic pesticides. This bust is part of a long-running effort to combat drug-trafficking organizations that use protected national park lands for cultivation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has disqualified Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, from acting as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, ruling her appointment was legally invalid. The judge concluded that the Trump administration's "novel series of legal and personnel moves" to install her in the position violated federal law. While the decision does not automatically dismiss criminal indictments approved by Habba, it bars her from participating in ongoing cases. The administration has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which it characterized as judicial activism.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast. While the storm did not make landfall, it brought tropical storm conditions, dangerous surf, and life-threatening rip currents to the Outer Banks, prompting evacuation orders and a state of emergency. The National Hurricane Center continues to warn beachgoers along most of the U.S. East Coast to avoid swimming due to the hazardous conditions generated by the large storm system. The hurricane is expected to gradually weaken over the weekend.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new guidance for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to stop promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidelines also aim to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing, following investigations that found some products were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the voluntary guidelines, with the government warning that "alternative measures" may be considered if they fail to make their products healthier.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., said he was perplexed by the company's stock drop following what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly report. Despite Walmart raising its full-year sales and earnings forecast, its shares fell, making it the biggest loser on the Dow for the day. Simon highlighted the retailer's ability to grow its top line, expand margins, and effectively manage the impact of tariffs as reasons for optimism. He suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues. (not investment advice)</p>
