          <p>The baseball bat famously flipped by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, which led to a temporary suspension, has been sold at auction for $9,882. The incident, which occurred during a sectional tournament, drew national attention and even support from major league players after Rocco's family successfully challenged the suspension in court. All proceeds from the auction, which attracted 68 bids, will be donated to the Haddonfield Little League program where the boy plays. The event was also commemorated with a pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

          <p>In a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, singer Angélique Kidjo and cellist Yo-Yo Ma presented "Sarabande Africaine," a concert exploring the African roots of Baroque music. The show highlighted the historical connection between African dances and classical forms like the sarabande, famously used by Bach and Handel. The collaboration, which also featured works by Philip Glass and George Gershwin, blended diverse musical traditions, with Kidjo's powerful vocals transforming familiar pieces. The event celebrated cultural unity and the often-overlooked historical influences that have shaped Western classical music.</p>

This is the first time the jackpot has reached this level in over a year, following 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. The odds of winning are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant federal and state taxes.</p>

          <h2>Severe Drought Reveals 40 Ancient Tombs at Iraq's Largest Reservoir</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were exposed by receding water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe, multi-year drought plaguing the country has lowered the water to a point where the Hellenistic-era tombs in the Khanke region became accessible for excavation. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has inadvertently created opportunities for archaeological discovery. The team is now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is expected to reject any proposal from Crystal Palace that includes taking defender Joe Gomez on loan as part of a deal for Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace has shown interest in a loan for Gomez to facilitate Liverpool's potential acquisition of their captain, Guehi. Reports suggest Palace might consider an offer of around £30 million plus the loan arrangement. However, sources indicate that Liverpool has no intention of allowing Gomez to leave on a temporary basis this month, complicating the potential transfer negotiations.</p>

          <p>A four-day period without public appearances by President Donald Trump has triggered a wave of speculation and rumors on social media, with hashtags like #whereistrump trending. While Trump remained active on his Truth Social platform, some commentators noted stylistic differences in the posts, fueling theories about his health and well-being. The speculation was also linked to recent questions about marks on his hands and comments from Vice President JD Vance about being prepared to assume the presidency. An Axios reporter later confirmed that Trump was seen on Saturday morning, heading to play golf, effectively quelling the unfounded rumors.</p>

He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress, and lifelong learning by reading on diverse subjects to maintain curiosity. He also uses a color-coded organizational system with sticky notes, engages in daily physical activity like swimming and walking, and maintains a healthy diet with proper hydration and at least seven hours of sleep.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist investment firm, has announced it has taken a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on Southern California warehouses. Rexford's stock has underperformed recently, trading at a discount despite holding a valuable portfolio in a strong market. Elliott is expected to push for changes to address what it likely views as poor corporate governance, bloated expenses, and a misaligned growth strategy. This move could lead to a board shake-up, better capital allocation, or even put the company in play for a potential acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>
