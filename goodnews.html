          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has firmly stated that the football club is not for sale, having "unequivocally rejected" two separate expressions of interest. The announcement followed the recent departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential takeover. The club's majority owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, confirmed it has no intention of selling its nearly 87% stake. The two rejected approaches came from PCP International Finance Limited and a consortium led by Firehawk Holdings Limited.</p>

          <p>This article from Fox News argues that self-driving trucks are essential for addressing critical issues in the American logistics sector, including a severe driver shortage and rising costs. The author frames autonomy not as a threat to jobs but as a technological advancement that will enhance efficiency and create new roles, similar to how ATMs affected bank tellers. The article highlights that China is aggressively investing in this technology, and for the U.S. to remain competitive, it must embrace autonomous freight. States like Texas are presented as models for creating a regulatory environment that encourages innovation in this field.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Forthcoming U.S. dietary guidelines are expected to revise long-standing advice that favored low-fat or fat-free dairy options. For decades, recommendations focused on limiting saturated fat, but recent research suggests that saturated fat from dairy does not behave as previously thought in relation to heart disease. Studies indicate that full-fat dairy may have neutral or even beneficial effects on cholesterol and blood pressure compared to low-fat alternatives, possibly due to other bioactive components in milk fat. Nutrition experts now argue that the evidence to universally recommend low-fat over full-fat dairy is weak, suggesting guidance should be more nuanced.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major food brands are increasingly committing to removing artificial dyes from their products, responding to consumer pressure and potential regulatory changes. However, the transition to natural colorants derived from sources like beets and turmeric presents significant challenges. Companies are investing heavily to ensure naturally dyed products maintain the vibrant, saturated colors that consumers have been conditioned to expect, fearing a negative reaction like the one General Mills faced with a muted version of Trix cereal. Natural dyes can be costlier, less stable, and may introduce unintended flavors, complicating the reformulation of products like icing and sports drinks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans' public education system was radically transformed, beginning with the mass firing of its experienced, predominantly Black teaching force. As schools reopened, many as charters, they were largely staffed by young, inexperienced teachers from outside the city through programs like Teach For America. While academic metrics like graduation rates improved, the shift was painful for veteran educators and created challenges, particularly in special education. Over the past two decades, the teacher workforce has gradually returned to a more experienced and diverse profile, reflecting a long and complex rebuilding process.</p>

          <p>Securing tickets for the 2026 World Cup is expected to be challenging and expensive, with the first sales window opening soon. FIFA is introducing a new "variable pricing" system for the tournament, where ticket prices will fluctuate based on demand, a first for the World Cup. While FIFA states this is different from automated dynamic pricing, a team will make real-time adjustments, meaning the initial accessible price points could rise quickly. With over 5 million attendees expected for the expanded 48-team tournament across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, demand is projected to far exceed supply.</p>

          <p>In a story from 1980, a recent college graduate named Elaine Batchelor recounts a frightening experience while backpacking alone across Europe. On a night train from Yugoslavia to Greece, two young men began to forcefully pull her toward the back of the train. Before they could harm her, two older men intervened, pulling her away from her assailants. These two strangers then stood guard over her for the entire 12-hour journey, sharing their food and water without being able to speak the same language. Batchelor remembers their silent protection as a profound act of human kindness.</p>

          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy, driven by the massive power demands of AI and data centers, is attracting significant investment, though challenges remain. Projections show investments in the nuclear value chain could reach $2.2 trillion by 2025, but the sector faces hurdles like vast capital requirements, long project lead times, and regulatory uncertainty. While small modular reactors (SMRs) offer a more scalable solution with shorter payback periods, they have yet to reach the commercial stage. Financial institutions are now more open to financing nuclear projects, but government backing is still seen as essential to mitigate the high risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has extended its streak of gold buying, increasing its holdings for the 23rd consecutive month as it seeks to diversify its reserves away from US dollar-backed assets. The country's gold holdings rose to 74.02 million ounces at the end of August, part of a broader trend where global central banks are increasing their gold reserves amid geopolitical risks. This shift has reportedly led to foreign central banks holding more gold than US Treasuries for the first time since 1996. A recent survey indicated that 95% of central banks expect global gold reserves to continue increasing over the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

As a result of this shift, Germany, which saw a 43% drop in applications, is no longer the most preferred destination for asylum seekers in the EU.

The article suggests that while Rodgers may no longer be the dynamic player of his MVP years, his intelligence and arm strength make him a formidable "point-guard" style quarterback.
