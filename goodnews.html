        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. These changes are designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income has not increased. The adjustments mean Americans will need to earn more to reach a higher tax rate, and standard deductions for all filing statuses have also been raised. The article also notes a temporary deduction for seniors and explains the mechanics of the U.S. progressive tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly narrowed the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair down to five individuals after a series of interviews. The finalists include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. The selection process will continue with another round of interviews, with a final decision from President Trump expected after Thanksgiving. The strategy may involve nominating the chosen candidate to a governor's seat first to ensure a full 14-year term. (not investment advice)</p>

The committee highlighted her "brave and committed" struggle against Venezuela's authoritarian regime and her steadfast support for a peaceful transition of power. In their announcement, the committee also spoke broadly about the global retreat of democracy and the rise of authoritarianism.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller stated he continues to support lowering interest rates but emphasized the need for a cautious approach due to conflicting economic data. In a CNBC interview, Waller noted the contrast between a weakening labor market and strong GDP growth, suggesting that policy should not be aggressive until the economic direction is clearer. He expressed comfort with the Fed's current projection of two more quarter-point cuts this year but pushed back against calls for faster, larger reductions. Waller, a finalist for the Fed Chair position, also described his recent interview as a serious, non-political economic discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Highlights Over-Cautiousness as a Major Mistake for Young Investors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the biggest mistake young investors make is worrying more about downside risk than upside potential. He argues that young people should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding cash or bonds, as they have a long time horizon to recover from market volatility and benefit from compounding. Historically, stocks have significantly outperformed other asset classes over the long term, making them essential for building wealth. For beginners, the article recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds to achieve diversified stock market exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Costco Emerges as a Major Player in Apparel Retail</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco has quietly grown into a nearly $10 billion apparel retailer, with its clothing sales increasing by almost 40% between 2019 and 2024. This growth, driven by offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label, means its apparel revenue now surpasses that of established retailers like Old Navy. The company's success is partly attributed to a "treasure hunt" shopping experience, where opportunistic purchases create a rotating and unpredictable selection. This strategy has proven so effective that it has drawn legal challenges from brands like Lululemon, signaling that major clothing retailers now view Costco as a serious competitor.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in Bitcoin's price has created approximately 70,000 new millionaires over the past year, bringing the global total to over 240,000 individuals with crypto holdings of at least $1 million. According to a new study, these investors tend to spend more of their wealth gains compared to those with stock market or real estate wealth. This spending, estimated at $145 billion in 2024, is primarily directed toward restaurants, entertainment, and real estate rather than just luxury goods. However, the study also notes that a crypto crash could have a significant negative impact on consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially begun in Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces repositioning troops along newly agreed-upon lines. The agreement, approved by the Israeli government, initiates a phased process that includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the operation, the U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with around 200 personnel to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid.

Wu Changbin, director of the China Deep Ocean Affairs Administration, argued that as the nation with the largest number of mining areas, China should be deeply involved in shaping the regulatory framework. In an article for a Communist Party newspaper, he emphasized the need to develop advanced domestic equipment to increase China's competitiveness.

          <p>The NBA is marking a significant return to China with two preseason games in Macao, signaling a renewed effort to grow its second-largest market after a six-year hiatus. The relationship soured in 2019, but the league is now rebuilding ties, evidenced by a renewed partnership with Alibaba and high demand for game tickets. With a massive fan base of over 400 million followers on Chinese social media, the NBA sees significant growth potential in the country as U.S. television viewership declines.

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google with "strategic market status" for its search and search advertising services, activating new regulatory powers. The designation follows an investigation that concluded Google has "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of U.K. searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, this status means the CMA can now impose conduct requirements on Google to improve competition. Potential interventions could include fairer search rankings and greater publisher control over content, including its use in AI-generated results.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, will soon affect a popular tax break for high earners. Starting in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their "catch-up" contributions on a post-tax Roth basis. Currently, these extra contributions for workers aged 50 and over can be made as either pretax or Roth, depending on the plan. This change eliminates the upfront tax deduction on catch-up savings for this group, prompting financial advisors to recommend that affected individuals review their tax strategies now.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that the Nobel Committee's decision to award the Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado indirectly benefits President Trump's foreign policy goals. The Trump administration has been a staunch supporter of Machado and has actively worked to pressure the regime of Nicolás Maduro, whom it views as an enemy. By elevating Machado's international stature, the Nobel Prize provides her with a layer of protection and legitimacy, making it harder for Maduro to suppress her. The article posits that this could embolden her efforts and bring the U.S. goal of regime change in Venezuela a step closer.</p>
