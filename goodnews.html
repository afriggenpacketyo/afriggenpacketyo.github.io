          <p>Emma Raducanu's Italian Open run ended in the fourth round with a straight-sets loss to Coco Gauff. Gauff, ranked third in the world, demonstrated her prowess on clay, returning serves effectively and holding her own in service games. Raducanu, despite the loss, acknowledged the positives from her three consecutive clay-court match wins, a first in her career, stating that she aims to "win the day" even after the defeat. Gauff, who reached the French Open final three years prior, emphasized the importance of her forehand as a key weapon in the match.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order targeting high drug prices in the U.S., seeking to align them with lower prices paid in other developed countries. The order directs actions against policies that lower drug prices abroad and encourages direct-to-consumer sales to bypass insurance. It also sets price targets for drugmakers, with potential investigations and market opening to imports as consequences for non-compliance. The move has faced criticism from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that foreign countries should pay their fair share for medicines.</p>

The National Grid stated that the fault on its transmission network was resolved quickly and did not interrupt supply, but a voltage dip may have affected power supplies on the low voltage distribution network.</p>
