          <h2>San Francisco Grapples with Rising Canine-Related Complaints</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco, despite being rated a top dog-friendly city, is experiencing growing tensions among residents regarding canine behavior. Complaints on social media and from citizens highlight issues like dogs in grocery stores, off-leash incidents, and a lack of owner accountability for their pets' actions. This friction has led to calls for stricter enforcement of existing laws, including potential fines for unleashed dogs and clearer regulations for service animals, as reports of off-leash incidents have increased significantly over the past year. The city's health code already prohibits dogs from being off-leash in undesignated areas, but residents feel these rules are not consistently applied, leading to a decline in civic harmony and public space enjoyment.</p>

          <p>Senne Lammens, Manchester United's 23-year-old goalkeeper, made a promising debut, earning cheers from fans despite a few mishaps. The Stretford End playfully compared him to legendary goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, reflecting a desire for a reliable alternative to current options. Lammens made two significant saves, demonstrating agility and confidence, which impressed his manager, Ruben Amorim, and commentators. This performance offers a positive sign for the club, which secured its first clean sheet of the season and a third consecutive home win. Amorim noted Lammens' adaptation and comfort during the game, emphasizing the pressure on goalkeepers at the club.</p>

          <p>Acoustic piano sales have plummeted dramatically since 1925, with only 17,294 units sold in 2024, reflecting shifting cultural trends and economic pressures on millennials. However, the instrument's presence in homes persists through the rise of digital and hybrid pianos, which offer more affordable and compact alternatives. Experts view this shift positively, as digital instruments provide accurate sounds and functional keys, making them accessible for beginners. There is optimism for a resurgence in piano playing, driven by a potential weariness of screens and a renewed interest in musicality and emotional expression. This evolution suggests a stable future for piano playing, albeit in new forms.</p>

          <p>The US Treasury is considering minting a new $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump for the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design, shared by US Treasurer Brandon Beach, depicts Trump with a clenched fist, referencing his 2024 assassination attempt, and the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." This initiative is enabled by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. While a final design is pending, the proposal has sparked debate, as existing laws typically prohibit living persons from appearing on US currency. A Treasury spokesperson stated the draft reflects the enduring spirit of the country.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has set an unwanted Premier League record by being substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts due to injuries. Following "phenomenal" play, he was withdrawn from the West Ham game with a knee injury after earlier shoulder issues. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed concern about Odegaard's recurring injuries, acknowledging his crucial role as captain and attacking player. The team hopes the latest injury is not severe, as his absence has been a consistent challenge for Arsenal this season, impacting their performance.

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through its prescription program, members with valid prescriptions can purchase a four-week supply for $499, targeting those paying out-of-pocket due to limited insurance coverage.
