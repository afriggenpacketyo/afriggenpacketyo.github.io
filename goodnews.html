          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota made a surprising discovery while working on a 2015 Ford Edge, finding a wallet that had been lost 11 years earlier by an assembly plant worker in Michigan. The wallet, which had traveled over 150,000 miles inside the vehicle's engine bay, contained the worker's ID, $15 in cash, and surprisingly, still-valid gift cards. The mechanic successfully used Facebook to track down the retired autoworker, Richard Guilford, and mailed the well-traveled wallet back to him, reuniting him with his long-lost possession.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have proposed a novel design for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees during flight. This innovative "scissor wing" concept aims to optimize performance across different speeds, maximizing lift for efficient takeoff and subsonic cruise while minimizing drag at transonic and hypersonic speeds. At its top speed of Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for enhanced high-speed stability. The design draws inspiration from a concept previously explored by NASA.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which included overcoming the lack of running water and electricity. Now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub, the historic fortress that once protected against French naval attacks is back on the market as a unique private venue for £3 million.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are employing creative strategies to manage the extra cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. Some parents focus on buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items to freeze for later, while others meticulously plan meals by portioning food into daily bags to ensure it lasts the week. These tactics, along with batch cooking and organizing the fridge to use older items first, help families stretch their budgets. The increased financial pressure comes as many households grapple with rising rents and childcare costs, making subsidized school meals a significant loss during the break.</p>

          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles has opened a new five-story vertical mausoleum named the Gower Mausoleum. This modern structure towers over the final resting places of Hollywood legends and provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people. The design emphasizes natural light and offers views of city landmarks, aiming to create a peaceful environment for visitors. The cemetery, known for hosting cultural events like movie nights and festivals, is adapting to the needs of its community by building upwards, with two floors of the new mausoleum already sold out.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, now preparing to receive their GCSE results, have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters, written just after returning to school from a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown, capture their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. The exercise, organized by their teacher, served as a poignant reflection on their disrupted secondary school experience and the personal growth they have undergone. The students looked back on their younger selves' questions about girlfriends, dreams of attending university, and hopes for a post-COVID world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, using Singapore as a launchpad to introduce diverse, regional cuisines to a global audience. Driven by intense competition at home, brands are moving beyond stereotypical Cantonese fare to offer authentic dishes from regions like Hunan, Sichuan, and Zhejiang. These companies bring sophisticated marketing, deep financial backing, and a focus on cultural immersion to challenge outdated perceptions of Chinese food in the West. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a potent form of soft power, potentially serving as a new form of "ping-pong diplomacy" for China.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley, compiling music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period yielded his last major hit, "Burning Love," and saw him develop into a more expressive ballad singer, though it was also marked by personal turmoil and professional disappointment, such as losing a role in "A Star Is Born." The box set offers a look into Presley's artistic state after his '68 comeback, as he navigated a cultural landscape he had helped create but was now somewhat removed from, just years before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors and are gaining traction on social media. While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with design are creating renewed competition, prompting speculation that Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026.
