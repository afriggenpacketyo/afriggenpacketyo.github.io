          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 04:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is offering tax refunds to major French cognac makers like Hennessy and R√©my Martin to resolve an anti-dumping investigation. The deal requires producers to agree to minimum selling prices and avoid dumping practices, with a July 5 deadline looming. If no agreement is reached, temporary tariffs could become permanent, impacting the primarily French-produced spirit. This move occurs amidst broader trade tensions between China and the European Union, with the potential agreement offering a path to de-escalation for the industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a major review of its parental leave and pay policies for the first time in decades, aiming to modernize the system. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which critics have labeled as flawed and among the worst in the developed world. Campaign groups have praised the review as a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families. However, some business advocates express concern that increased employer costs could lead to job losses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, has stated that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions to control inflation is now complete. He affirmed that the primary goal of reducing the inflation rate from its peak back toward the 2% target has been achieved. While this phase is over, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared for new economic shocks and potential future rate adjustments. Other central bank officials echoed this sentiment, suggesting that any future moves would likely be further rate cuts to support a sluggish European economy.</p>

While harsh on Russell, the move is considered conceivable given Verstappen's status as the world's top driver. The piece also addresses the on-air tensions between Lewis Hamilton and his Ferrari engineer, which Hamilton dismisses as normal communication. Additionally, it covers the promising F1 prospects of young driver Alex Dunne and the strategic challenges facing the new Cadillac F1 team as it prepares to enter the sport.</p>

          <p>Hot weather is set to continue in southeast England, with temperatures potentially reaching a new high for the year at 34-35C, while the rest of the UK experiences cooler conditions. The UK Health Security Agency has extended amber heat health alerts for much of England, signaling ongoing impacts on services like the NHS. The heatwave, attributed to a 'heat dome' over Europe, is part of a broader trend of increasingly common high temperatures in the UK. By Wednesday, the heat is expected to break nationwide, providing relief, including for the Wimbledon tennis tournament.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley startup Lyten has announced it will acquire Northvolt Dwa ESS, Europe's largest energy storage systems factory, located in Gdansk, Poland. The move comes after the previous owner, Northvolt, filed for bankruptcy in March, ending a major European effort to compete with Chinese battery manufacturers. Lyten plans to immediately restart operations at the 25,000-square-meter facility to fulfill existing and new customer orders. The acquisition, with undisclosed financial terms, signals a strategic expansion for Lyten into the European energy storage market.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new framework using satellite remote sensing data to more accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. This innovative method could provide a standardized, high-precision approach for global carbon accounting, which is currently lacking. The study suggests this technology has significant potential for verifying emissions from individual facilities and detecting anomalies. The framework could also be adapted to monitor other major emission sources, such as oil and gas fields or steel plants, enhancing global climate change mitigation efforts.</p>

The People's Bank of China has been setting stronger daily reference rates, with the onshore yuan gaining 1.86% in the first half of the year. According to a Goldman Sachs analyst, this is driven by a less bearish outlook on China's growth and growing investor concerns about U.S. government debt and fiscal policies. The investment bank predicts the yuan will continue to appreciate, potentially breaking the 7-per-dollar level within six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI for China unexpectedly rose to 50.4 in June, indicating a return to growth after contracting in May. This private survey, which focuses on smaller, export-oriented firms, diverged from official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The expansion was supported by increased production and new orders, although new export orders continued to decline. Despite the positive reading, the report noted that employment in the sector remains weak and an intensifying price war is squeezing profit margins for manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>
