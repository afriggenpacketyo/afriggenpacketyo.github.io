          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order temporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan's ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit, arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of due process to seek asylum. The administration contended it was reuniting children with their families at their request, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers. The order requires the children to be returned to Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz affirmed that while Germany seeks a swift end to the war in Ukraine, peace cannot be achieved at the expense of Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. In an interview, Merz stated that allowing Ukraine to capitulate would endanger other countries, including Germany, in the near future. He emphasized that supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia remains an "absolute priority." Germany is a significant military backer of Ukraine, having committed approximately €40 billion in support since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>Liverpool claimed a crucial early-season victory against Premier League title rivals Arsenal, winning 1-0 at Anfield. The decisive moment came from a spectacular 83rd-minute free-kick by Dominik Szoboszlai. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was criticized for a conservative tactical approach that seemed aimed at securing a draw rather than pursuing a win. The result extends Arsenal's long winless streak at Anfield, marking a significant psychological blow for the London club in their championship aspirations.</p>

The company acknowledged a "software issue" was responsible and worked for several hours to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage peaked in the afternoon with nearly 23,000 complaints on the service tracking site DownDetector. Verizon later announced that service had been fully restored by midnight, apologizing for the widespread inconvenience.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lando Norris described his retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix as a significant blow to his world championship hopes. An oil leak forced him out of the race, which was won by his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri. The result widens the points gap between the two drivers to 34, putting Norris under increased pressure with nine races left in the season. Despite the frustration, Norris stated he now feels he can "just go for it" and will give his all to win the remaining races.</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 loss to Brighton, Manchester City is experiencing its worst start to a Premier League season since 2004-05, prompting questions about their ability to challenge for the title. Despite significant spending and the return of key player Rodri, the team has shown inconsistency reminiscent of last season's trophyless campaign. While manager Pep Guardiola remains calm, stating the season is long, no team in the 38-game era has recovered from such a position to win the league. The pressure is mounting for the team to find form quickly.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move expected to support thousands of UK jobs into the 2030s. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet to operate jointly in the North Atlantic. The deal represents a significant victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new long-term strategies to support Ukraine, signaling a shift toward more robust measures. Among the ideas discussed were imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production within the "safe haven" of EU countries like Denmark. Ministers also revisited the contentious idea of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. These proposals reflect a search for more impactful ways to sustain Ukraine and pressure Russia as the war continues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 12:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital underwater ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation cleared 80 acres of "urchin barrens" by smashing nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins that had decimated the kelp. This effort has allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to return, restoring critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and providing a model for similar restoration projects globally. The project demonstrates how targeted intervention can help a resilient ecosystem recover from collapse.</p>
