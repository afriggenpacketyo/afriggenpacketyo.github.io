          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 21:54:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 627, known as the "No Secret Police Act," which largely prohibits local and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during operations, including immigration enforcement. The bill, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, aims to enhance transparency and public trust, particularly following a surge in immigration operations. While proponents argue it promotes accountability and prevents impersonation, law enforcement groups oppose it, citing concerns for officer safety and the realities of undercover work. The article details various exemptions, such as for SWAT teams and protective gear against toxins, underscoring the ongoing debate about balancing public oversight with operational necessities in policing.</p>

Mamdani, a democratic socialist state lawmaker, achieved a surprising primary victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Hochul's endorsement comes after "frank conversations" where Mamdani reportedly affirmed his commitment to public safety and affordability, addressing previous points of contention regarding policing and Israel. The article emphasizes Mamdani's substantial lead in recent polls and the historical implications of his potential election as the city's first Muslim and millennial mayor, indicating a notable shift in the city's political landscape and priorities.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death and infertility among the marsupials. Developed over a decade by UniSC researchers, the vaccine aims to reduce the rapid spread of the infection, which affects up to 70% of some koala populations. This article explains that chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and while antibiotics exist, they are not always effective and can have side effects.
