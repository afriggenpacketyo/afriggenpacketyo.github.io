          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:17:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who volunteer to return to their countries of origin. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that this 'self-deportation' program is the safest and most cost-effective way for immigrants to leave the United States, avoiding arrest and saving taxpayer money. Immigrants must use the CBP's 'Home' app to confirm their arrival in their home country to receive the stipend. Participants will also be deprioritized for detention and removal while they prepare to depart, potentially keeping the door open for legal immigration in the future.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced that its nonprofit arm will maintain control of the company despite restructuring into a public benefit corporation, a decision made after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. This move addresses pressure from civic leaders and former employees concerned about the company's direction as it navigates the competitive AI landscape. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the arrangement, emphasizing that the nonprofit and the PBC will share the same mission. The announcement comes amid an ongoing legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes OpenAI's transition to a for-profit model. </p>

          <p>Three women who were part of 'Operation Babylift,' the U.S. government's airlift of Vietnamese children to America for adoption in April 1975, shared their experiences 50 years later. The series of flights, aimed at rescuing children during the fall of Saigon, was not without controversy, as some children were later found to have living families. While some adoptees have sought to uncover their past through DNA tests, others have no desire to find biological relatives, all three women expressed love for their adoptive parents and gratitude for the opportunities they have had in America. One of the women recounts how she was sexually abused as a young child by individuals close to the family and now uses her music to help foster and adopted children who have similar trauma.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a surge in sponsorships and stadium attendance, driven by the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S. and the arrival of Lionel Messi.

The approaching 2026 World Cup and the sport's growing cultural relevance are contributing to this growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but this is inaccurate. According to AAA, U.S. drivers are paying over $3 per gallon on average. Trump's figure appears to be based on RBOB gasoline futures, which do not reflect retail prices as they exclude taxes, transportation, and other costs. GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis, Patrick De Haan, said that RBOB is irrelevant to the consumer, as they are not paying the wholesale price of RBOB.</p>

          <p>New York City is ending its decades-long Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which aimed to protect the city's drinking water supply by purchasing land in the watershed. Since 1997, the city has acquired over 156,000 acres to prevent pollution, but an independent review found that further land purchases would have little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring local approval for land transactions.

          <p>Southern California is experiencing lingering showers and cooler temperatures, but a period of warm, dry weather is on the way. A high-pressure system is building across the region, and by Wednesday and Thursday, the chance of rain will disappear. Temperatures will climb dramatically, with highs in the mid-80s to early 90s by the end of the week. Those highs are expected to be five to 10 degrees above average for this time of year.</p>

          <p>The British royal family, including King Charles, Prince William, and Catherine, Princess of Wales, along with their children, watched a military procession and flypast to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day. The family watched the procession of about 1,300 people from a raised platform outside Buckingham Palace and later moved to the palace balcony to see a flypast. The event kicked off four days of events commemorating the end of most fighting in Europe 80 years ago.</p>
