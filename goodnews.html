          <p>European Union leaders have committed in principle to providing financial support for Ukraine through 2026 and 2027, but a concrete funding plan has been deferred to a December meeting. The delay stems from ongoing debates over the legal and financial risks associated with leveraging frozen Russian Central Bank assets as collateral for a substantial loan to Kyiv. While most EU leaders, excluding Hungary, approved a statement, the specifics of how to address Ukraine's pressing financial and defense needs remain to be ironed out by the European Commission. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the urgency of receiving funds early in 2026.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has publicly challenged President Donald Trump to a sports bet on the upcoming World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers, humorously suggesting Trump is "afraid" to lose. Carney, predicting a Blue Jays victory in six games, noted that Trump had not returned his calls regarding the wager. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned, stated she had not observed Trump engaging in sports gambling. The Blue Jays seek their first title since 1993, while the Dodgers aim for a second consecutive championship, with Los Angeles currently favored.</p>

          <p>Nationwide student lunch debt has escalated to nearly $200 million per year, prompting individual citizens to step in and ensure children are fed. In Utah, where debt approaches $4 million, a single father, DJ Bracken, paid off a school's debt and established a foundation to help more than 30 schools. Special education teacher Kati Jo Christensen leveraged TikTok dances to raise nearly $30,000 for the cause. While these acts of kindness are crucial, Bracken advocates for legislative action, questioning the allocation of tax dollars if not towards feeding children, especially after federal free lunch programs ended in 2022.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, following widespread condemnation from California leaders and public protests. Reports of over 100 Customs and Border Protection agents being sent to the Bay Area sparked demonstrations. Trump confirmed his decision on Truth Social after speaking with Mayor Daniel Lurie and Silicon Valley executives. Local officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, had vowed legal challenges and criticized the move as authoritarian. Despite the reversal, community organizers remain prepared to support residents, highlighting ongoing concerns about federal immigration enforcement.</p>

Its Guangzhou facility, currently supplying mainland China, Macau, and Southeast Asia with large-molecule therapies like PD-1 inhibitors, is slated to expand production to serve Hong Kong. BeOne's flagship small-molecule drug, a BTK inhibitor, has contributed to the company's recent profitability in global markets.</p>

Hamilton, drawing on his own intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, stressed the need for the McLaren drivers to be "cut-throat" and consistent to defend their lead. Verstappen, having won four titles, is seen as having an easier job as the hunter, while the McLaren drivers must manage the pressure of defending their positions.</p>

          <p>Industry experts at the 11th Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai suggest that increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China could significantly advance the cryptocurrency sector. Despite the mainland's years-long ban on many crypto-related activities, both markets possess unique strengths: Hong Kong as a financial hub with leading crypto regulation, and the mainland with strong developer involvement in digital payments and AI. Cyberport, a Hong Kong government-backed tech hub, and the Solana Foundation, which supports China's developer ecosystem, expressed eagerness to deepen cooperation in areas like decentralized payments and artificial intelligence.

This was due to the Angels incurring penalties for an earlier international signing, limiting their ability to offer substantial bonuses.

The 9-0 decision, led by a Trump-appointed chief judge, represents a significant pushback against the administration's actions. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins had requested a halt to nearly all cases, arguing that the lapse in federal funding precluded the VA from meeting court deadlines. Veterans groups, however, criticized this as a pretext to deny veterans their rightful day in court, with some having waited decades for claims related to toxic exposure.
