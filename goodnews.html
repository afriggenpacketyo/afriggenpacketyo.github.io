          <p>This article discusses the limitations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and proposes a shift towards protecting entire ecosystems rather than focusing solely on individual species. The Trump administration's efforts to narrow the definition of harm to endangered species have prompted conservationists to consider alternative approaches. Protecting ecosystems directly could be more efficient and effective, as it recognizes the dynamic nature of these systems and their ability to support a wide range of species. The article explores the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a native ecosystem-protection act to supplement the ESA, including bipartisan support and job creation.</p>

The Vienna Symphony Orchestra's performance will be broadcast on May 31, coinciding with the European Space Agency's 50th anniversary. The ESA's big radio antenna in Spain will direct the radio signals toward Voyager 1, correcting what the Vienna tourist board calls a "cosmic mistake" for not including the waltz on the Voyager Golden Records. This event follows other musical transmissions into deep space, such as NASA's transmission of the Beatles' "Across the Universe."</p>
