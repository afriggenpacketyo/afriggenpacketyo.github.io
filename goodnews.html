          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, who introduced the bill, anticipates a close vote but believes there is sufficient support for reform. The proposed legislation includes safeguards such as requiring two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness. Former First Ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf oppose the bill, raising concerns about potential coercion, while other MSPs have voiced their support.</p>
