          <p>Scottish rugby centre Sione Tuipulotu is regaining his top form during the British and Irish Lions tour in Australia after recovering from an injury that caused him to miss the Six Nations. He expressed confidence in his performance following a strong game against the Western Force, highlighting his effective partnership with Irish player Garry Ringrose. Tuipulotu also praised the influence of fly-half Finn Russell, noting that the team's blend of structured play and individual instinct makes them difficult to defend against. The team is now preparing for a more challenging match against the Reds in Brisbane.</p>

          <h2>Fungus Historically Linked to "Pharaoh's Curse" Shows Potential in Cancer Treatment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have discovered that a modified compound from the fungus *Aspergillus flavus* shows promise in fighting cancer cells. This fungus was historically rumored to be the cause of the "pharaoh's curse" after several archaeologists died following the opening of ancient tombs. Scientists created a new compound that effectively blocks the division of leukemia cells, with one variant performing as well as two FDA-approved drugs. While the study is in its early stages and has so far only been tested on cell cultures, it represents a potential new avenue for cancer therapy derived from natural sources.</p>

          <p>Georgian-Spanish fighter Ilia Topuria captured his second UFC championship belt by defeating Charles Oliveira with a spectacular knockout at UFC 317 in Las Vegas. Moving up to the lightweight division, the undefeated Topuria (17-0) became the tenth fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two different weight classes. After the victory, he declared that he represents the "new generation of mixed martial arts." The win sets up a potential future confrontation with Paddy Pimblett, who challenged Topuria in a post-fight face-off, though Topuria remains a dominant and rising star in the sport.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the start, as Chavez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father, boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., at ringside. The victory extends Paul's professional record to 12 wins, though it continues to raise questions about the caliber of his opponents. Following the win, Paul called out current champions, signaling his ambition to pursue a world title shot.</p>

          <p>Despite its international isolation, Afghanistan's Taliban government is actively encouraging tourism, seeing it as a vital source of revenue for its struggling economy. A small but growing number of foreign tourists are venturing into the country, drawn by its landscapes and history, now that the decades-long war has ended and general violence has decreased. While Western governments still advise against travel, the Taliban are issuing visas and have even established a hospitality training institute. The trend raises ethical questions, particularly regarding the government's severe restrictions on women, but some visitors feel their travel supports local people directly rather than the regime.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career, a 101.7 mph fastball, showcasing his increasing arm strength following elbow surgery. Although he went hitless as a batter in the game, his performance on the mound was a positive development. Ohtani noted that his velocity naturally increases in high-pressure situations with runners on base, and he was pleased with his ability to aggressively attack the strike zone during his third start of the season.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban that prohibits lighting up on all public beaches, in parks, near schools, and in other public spaces. The rules, which went into effect on Sunday, are part of a national plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and protect non-smokers, particularly children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants. Health officials note that while smoking rates are declining, tobacco-related illnesses still cause around 75,000 deaths annually in France.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. This year's events blend celebration with a defiant tone of protest, responding to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals. The theme for NYC Pride is "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," reflecting a more political stance than in recent years. Organizers also face challenges from reduced corporate sponsorship, as some major companies have pulled back their support amid a shifting public and political climate surrounding diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
