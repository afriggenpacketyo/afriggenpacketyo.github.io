          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, is demonstrating remarkable success in treating Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. By using a faster, more accessible single-visit model, the La Bodega clinic has achieved a 98% cure rate among its more than 7,000 patients. This success, aided by new FDA-approved testing and lower drug costs, has made the clinic a national model. Lawmakers are now considering a bipartisan bill to fund a national plan to eliminate the disease, which could save the government billions in long-term medical costs.</p>

          <p>In a late-night session, the U.S. Senate successfully advanced a package of spending bills, breaking a partisan stalemate and taking a crucial step toward avoiding a government shutdown. The passage marks the first time since 2018 that the chamber has passed appropriations bills before September. The package, which includes funding for Veterans' Affairs and agriculture, was a victory for Senate leadership from both parties. However, the bills now head to the House, where they face opposition from Republicans over spending levels.</p>

Experts suggest that shifting global geopolitics and trade wars are pushing the two Asian giants toward engagement. However, the unresolved and contentious border dispute remains a significant obstacle to a full normalization of ties.</p>

The team acquired right-handed relief pitchers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase to reinforce their bullpen. They also added versatile outfielder Alex Call to provide more depth in the lineup.

          <p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years. This figure suggests a more stable workforce than is often speculated for China's demanding tech sector, which is known for its high turnover and infamous "996" work culture. The company revealed the data to counter online rumors that its average employee tenure was only about seven months, indicating it is a relatively attractive employer in the industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for tens of thousands of individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the terminations were "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus," citing controversial statements made by the president.</p>

          <p>In a unique act of revenge, an Ohio woman whose car was repossessed discovered the dealership had allowed its business name registration to lapse and promptly registered it under her own name. She then sent the dealer a cease-and-desist letter and sued them for fraud. An appeals court recently ruled that her claim over the trade name is a separate issue from the car purchase and can proceed in court. The case highlights a creative use of public records by a scorned customer.</p>

          <p>Six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Keenan Allen is reportedly meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers to discuss a potential reunion. Allen, the franchise's longest-tenured player before being traded to the Chicago Bears last year, could fill a key need for a veteran receiver following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. A return would reunite Allen with quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he had significant success during his previous 11-season stint with the team.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court panel has expressed deep skepticism regarding the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship. During a hearing, judges sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows rulings from another federal appeals court and multiple lower courts that have already blocked the hardline immigration policy from taking effect, setting up a likely Supreme Court battle.</p>
