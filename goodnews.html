          <p>TeraWulf's stock experienced a significant rally, jumping over 10%, after Google increased its ownership stake in the bitcoin mining and datacenter company to 14%. This investment is part of a larger deal that provides up to $3.2 billion in total backstop funding to support the expansion of TeraWulf's facility in Lake Mariner, New York. The agreement, which strengthens the strategic alignment between the two companies for building advanced AI infrastructure, follows recent computing deals that have caused the company's shares to rise approximately 90% in the last week.

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly a third of individuals using the over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, were previously using no contraceptive method at all. The research, published in JAMA Network Open, surveyed users across 44 states and found the pill is successfully reaching populations with significant barriers to healthcare, including the uninsured, younger people, and those in rural areas. The most common reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment. Experts believe this increased access is a powerful tool for reproductive autonomy, especially for marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner revealed that kissing her 'Game of Thrones' co-star Kit Harington for their new horror film, "The Dreadful," was a deeply uncomfortable experience. Having portrayed siblings for years on the HBO series, the two actors share a close, brother-sister-like bond in real life, which made filming romantic scenes awkward. Turner explained on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" that both she and Harington were "retching" during their first kissing scene on set, describing the moment as "vile." Despite the awkwardness, they proceeded with the film because they felt the script was too good to refuse.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:28:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reinvesting stock dividends through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) is an effective strategy for investors to harness the power of compound interest. Instead of receiving cash payouts, a DRIP automatically uses dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock, including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work in an investment an individual already favors. While not suitable for those who rely on dividend income for expenses, historical data shows this method can significantly boost long-term returns; for example, the SPY S&P 500 ETF saw a much higher total return with dividends reinvested over a decade.

          <p>In a satirical column, The Atlantic imagines a specialized police unit dedicated to preventing "sandwich-based crimes" in Washington, D.C. The piece humorously critiques heavy-handed law enforcement tactics by contrasting them with the fictional unit's community-focused, de-escalation methods developed over 25 years of sandwich-crime-free peace. The narrative centers on the unit's dismay after federal marshals conduct a dramatic raid on a Justice Department worker accused of throwing a Subway sandwich. The satire uses the absurd premise to comment on disproportionate police responses and the importance of understanding the root causes of crime, rather than employing overwhelming force for minor infractions.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage is typically in one's late 60s to early 70s, though the decision depends heavily on individual circumstances. A reverse mortgage allows seniors aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly repayments, but the loan balance grows over time. Waiting until an older age generally allows borrowers to access a larger portion of their home's equity, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy. Homeowners should consider their long-term financial goals, health, and other retirement income sources before deciding, as taking the loan too early could deplete equity needed for future expenses or inheritances.

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim firmly defended his decision to start goalkeeper Altay Bayindir over Andre Onana in the team's Premier League loss to Arsenal. Amorim responded forcefully to media questions, stating Bayindir had performed well during the preseason and deserved to keep his spot, while Onana had only recently returned to full training after an injury. The manager's confrontational style drew comparisons to former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson's tactic of creating a united, 'us against the world' mentality. Amorim emphasized that his choice was based on merit and maintaining trust within the squad, dismissing suggestions it was a mistake.</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak in Texas that began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases. The declaration was made after 42 days—twice the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in counties with previous transmission. The outbreak predominantly affected children, and tragically, two unvaccinated children died from the highly contagious virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited the containment to a comprehensive response involving vaccination, testing, and public education, but warned that providers should remain vigilant as other outbreaks continue elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit over false claims made about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was reached before the case could go to trial, where a judge had already ruled that Newsmax did defame the voting equipment company. Internal communications revealed during the case showed that Newsmax officials and hosts knew the election fraud allegations were baseless but saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed them. This follows a similar, larger settlement paid by Fox News to Dominion in 2023.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo as part of its spinoff from parent company Comcast's NBC Universal. The new name, standing for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to underscore the brand's focus on breaking news and opinion journalism. The rebranding is part of the creation of a new, independent media company called Versant, which will also include CNBC and entertainment networks like USA and SYFY. The move aims to establish a separate identity for the news organization as it hires new journalists and charts its own course.</p>

          <p>As talks on the Ukraine war continue, this article examines the financial contributions made by the United States and Europe since Russia's 2022 invasion. According to the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has committed $130.6 billion, while European nations combined have provided more, at $165.7 billion. This contradicts some claims that the U.S. has shouldered a disproportionately larger share of the financial burden. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided a higher proportion of grants, while the EU has offered more loans, some with generous repayment terms tied to frozen Russian assets.</p>

          <p>Amid growing political pressure to lower drug prices, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to cash-paying U.S. patients. This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy and savings company GoodRx, expanding access for patients without insurance coverage. The move follows a similar price cut for its weight-loss drug Wegovy and is seen as an effort to make the branded medication more accessible and compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions.</p>

The acquisition aims to put the company on more stable financial footing, with Kutcher set to join the board of directors.
