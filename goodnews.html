          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, Pembrokeshire, has been transformed into a luxurious private venue and is now on the market for £3 million. The former CEO, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable, overcoming logistical hurdles like having no running water or electricity. Now equipped with 40 beds, a nightclub, and modern amenities, the historic fortress that once protected Milford Haven is being marketed as a unique party island or potential tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>As food prices rise, parents in the UK are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking methods to manage the cost of feeding children during the six-week school summer holidays. Strategies shared by families include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items for the freezer, batch cooking, and organizing the fridge to use food before it expires to minimize waste. Some parents also rely on local food pantries, which provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost, highlighting the financial pressures many households face when subsidized school meals are unavailable.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future as they prepared to sit their GCSE exams four years later. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disruptive period, provided a moment of reflection for the students on their personal growth and resilience. Their entire secondary education was shaped by the pandemic's impact.</p>

          <p>Nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by rioting inmates in Guatemala City have been freed. The riots began in two separate prisons when members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs demanded the return of ten of their leaders who had been transferred to a different facility. This incident followed a similar hostage situation earlier in the week where 11 other guards were freed. The events highlight the ongoing power and violence of major gangs within Guatemala's prison system.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged in the second quarter, rising from 23% to 31%, while Apple's share declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and new designs are creating renewed competition, with analysts expecting Apple to release its own foldable phone by 2026.

          <p>A New Zealand citizen and her young son have been released after being held in a U.S. immigration detention center in Texas for over three weeks. The mother, Sarah Shaw, who has been living legally in the U.S. since 2021, was detained at the Canadian border due to an expired travel permit, a mistake her lawyer described as a minor administrative error. Despite her son's valid documents, both were transported to a family residential center 2,000 miles from their home, an action her attorney called unnecessary and inhumane.</p>
