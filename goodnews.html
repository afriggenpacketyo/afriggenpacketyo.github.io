          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in the Tokyo assembly election, winning only 22 seats, signaling challenges for his minority government. Tomin First no Kai, established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, secured the most seats with 32, highlighting the popularity of her welfare and child-rearing policies. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito won 17 and 19 seats, respectively, while Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party, gained three seats. Voter turnout increased to 47.59 percent, up from the previous election.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This transformation was driven by government subsidies, long-term planning, and the mobilization of the economy towards EV production. Chinese companies like BYD now lead the global EV market, and the country has built the world's largest public charging network. While Western countries view China's approach as unfair business practice, China insists that all companies have access to the same resources.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to release a report on psychedelics later this year, including updated information on ketamine, and a psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Researchers studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, were amazed to find that most of the monkeys survived Hurricane Maria. The island lost two-thirds of its vegetation, but the monkeys found ways to survive, possibly by huddling together and eating seaweed. The team managed to save decades of data and biological samples by keeping freezers running with generators. The researchers, who have been studying the monkeys for over 80 years, considered the survival of their research a miracle.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report explores the unique survival strategies of sloths, the world's slowest mammal. Despite their slow movement and poor senses, sloths have thrived for 64 million years by conserving energy and digesting toxins slowly. Zoologist Lucy Cooke highlights the sloths' ability to blend into their environment and their solitary nature, except when mating. The report also touches on the threats sloths face from human encroachment, such as electrocution, and the efforts to rehabilitate injured and orphaned sloths.</p>

          <p>Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), reflected on the bank's first decade, noting its role in financing infrastructure across Asia and worldwide. The AIIB has financed over US$60 billion in infrastructure, including healthcare support during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank aims to supplement existing multilateral development banks in promoting sustainable development, addressing a massive funding gap for infrastructure needs in Asian countries. The AIIB adheres to its basic mandate and has made strong commitments to combat climate change through its projects.</p>

          <h2>Government Announces 10-Year Plan for Industry with Lower Energy Costs</h2>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy that includes measures to lower energy costs for businesses by scrapping green levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms, and the most energy-intensive firms will have their network charges cut. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending. Conservative acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticized the plans, saying the UK needed "a serious approach to energy policy" that "tackles the root cause of our high energy prices".
