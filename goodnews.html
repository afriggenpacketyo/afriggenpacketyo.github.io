          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes an additional two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The measure aims to prevent offenders from evading justice and provide victims' families with a sense of closure. While powers already exist to compel attendance, they are often not used due to potential risks of disruptive behavior in court. The bill, supported by victims' families, is viewed as a step in the right direction towards ensuring perpetrators face the consequences of their actions.</p>
