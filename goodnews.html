          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as complex international relations with the United States and China. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party is seeking a second term against opposition leader Peter Dutton, who are both addressing voters' cost-of-living concerns with small-scale economic measures. The article notes a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, and the failure of the 2023 referendum to enshrine rights for Aboriginal Australians in Parliament. The New York Times article underscores the dissatisfaction with current political offerings, emphasizing the need for deeper solutions to pressing issues.</p>

          <p>The United States has implemented a 25% import tax on key car parts, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. The new tariff follows a similar tax on imported cars and aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers. While companies have been shielded by a sales surge due to price hike concerns, General Motors anticipates significant new costs this year. The BBC article notes that some exemptions apply to parts from Mexico and Canada, and the administration has introduced measures to mitigate the impact on carmakers.</p>
