          <p>Albania is preparing for a crucial parliamentary election that will determine the country's democratic progress and its aspirations for EU integration. Prime Minister Edi Rama and the ruling Socialist Party are vying for a historic fourth term, while a fragmented opposition seeks to challenge their dominance. The election is seen as a pivotal moment for Albania's commitment to fighting corruption and implementing institutional reforms necessary for EU membership. Despite promises from both major parties, concerns remain about the inclusion of candidates under investigation, potentially undermining the justice system. The article highlights the importance of this election in shaping Albania's future and its relationship with the European Union.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, overall exports jumped by 8.1%. This shift indicates a strategic realignment in China's trade relationships, with ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand becoming increasingly important destinations for Chinese goods. However, analysts expect trade data to weaken in the coming months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale is exploring how cities can become resilient to extreme heat caused by climate change. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for architecture to harness collective intelligence and adapt building approaches. The biennale highlights the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces, and it showcases solutions such as redesigning public spaces and transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities." The German Pavilion features an immersive exhibition to illustrate the future urban climate, urging a global "construction revolution" to address the challenges of climate change.</p>

          <p>Japan will continue to insist on the complete removal of tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump, despite a recent trade agreement between the U.S. and Britain that leaves some levies in place.

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip is Nvidia's attempt to maintain its presence in China, a critical market, despite Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology. The modified chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity to comply with the new technical thresholds set by U.S. officials, who had previously blocked the original H20 from being sold in China without an export license.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline after its first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. While revenue increased by 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion, and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed analysts' estimates. The company attributed the miss to "production fluctuations" that led to lower average selling prices, with expectations of continued impact in the second quarter. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased, driven by changes in geopolitics and government policies, and capacity utilization reached 89.6%.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may be reduced as top trade officials prepare for talks. He noted that tariffs are currently at 145%, implying a potential decrease. The upcoming meeting in Switzerland signals a willingness to de-escalate the trade war, which has caused economic uncertainty. While China's exports to the U.S. have declined, its overall exports have risen, providing confidence in managing trade issues. Analysts caution that any tariff cuts are likely to be minor and that systemic frictions between the U.S. and China will persist.</p>
