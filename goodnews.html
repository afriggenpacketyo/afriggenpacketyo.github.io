          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, ensuring women will no longer be prosecuted for ending their pregnancies. The measure, led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, aims to provide compassion rather than criminalization for women who seek abortions after 24 weeks. MPs voted according to their personal beliefs on the issue, backing the plan by a significant majority. Abortion remains legal up to 24 weeks in Great Britain with the approval of two doctors. The change in legislation signals a move towards more compassionate healthcare policies, resulting in a higher optimism score.</p>
