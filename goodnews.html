          <p>Following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach. Postecoglou was recently sacked by Tottenham despite leading them to a Europa League victory, a move that surprised many in the football community. The potential appointment has generated mixed reactions among Forest fans, with some questioning his defensive tactics while others hope he can build on the club's recent successes. The club aims to finalize the appointment before their upcoming match against Arsenal.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch family has concluded, with a deal that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the media empire. The agreement ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's passing. Under the terms, Lachlan's siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of the trust holding company shares, receiving a cash buyout of approximately $1.1 billion each. This resolution effectively ends litigation over the family trust and removes the influence of the more politically moderate siblings.</p>

The initiative, a collaboration between the Shenzhen Taxation Bureau, the People's Bank of China, and Ant International's Alipay+, aims to streamline the refund process from days to seconds. Hong Kong visitors using AlipayHK are the first to benefit from this new, more convenient system.

          <p>Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, discusses the challenges facing American higher education and the notable surge in applications to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). She suggests that in an era of political attacks on diversity initiatives, Black students are increasingly seeking affirming environments where their history is valued rather than erased. Dr. Tatum also addresses the weaponization of issues like antisemitism and the pushback against DEI programs, framing it as a predictable backlash to racial progress. While HBCUs offer a refuge, they still face significant financial challenges in meeting student needs.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide for parents on how to make informed decisions about vaccinations in a new landscape where federal guidance may conflict with recommendations from medical organizations. With Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. altering U.S. vaccine policy, particularly for COVID-19 shots for children, a rift has emerged between the government and groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics. The article advises consulting multiple sources, including the CDC, professional medical societies, and a trusted family physician, to understand the risks and benefits. It also addresses the practical challenges of insurance coverage that may arise from these disagreements.</p>

          <p>A year after Brian Niccol took over as CEO of Starbucks, his efforts to revitalize the coffee giant have yielded mixed results, with same-store sales and traffic still declining. Niccol has focused on returning the chain to its roots as a "third place," improving the customer experience and operational efficiency. While some changes, like the "Green Apron Service" program, show promise, others have been met with criticism from both customers and unionizing baristas.

While the court found that Google illegally monopolized the search market, Judge Amit Mehta's penalty was limited, requiring the company to share some information with rivals. The judge argued that AI-powered chatbots from competitors like OpenAI could significantly disrupt Google's dominance, a "new reality" that influenced his decision to avoid more drastic structural remedies like selling off the Chrome browser.</p>
