          <p>The platform Substack is experiencing a surge in popularity within the literary world, becoming a vital space for discourse and discovery for both established and emerging writers. Unlike short-form video platforms, it fosters in-depth conversations and has helped lesser-known authors gain significant media attention for their new novels, a phenomenon dubbed "Substack summer." This trend is seen by many as a revival of the early 2000s blogosphere culture, providing a monetizable connection between writers and readers in a struggling book media ecosystem. Many authors credit the platform for creating a vibrant, supportive literary scene that has been diminishing in traditional media.</p>

          <p>Pfizer raised its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and strong business performance, which caused its shares to rise in premarket trading. The pharmaceutical company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs like Vyndaqel. The updated outlook now projects adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This positive forecast comes as the company navigates potential impacts from the Trump administration's calls for lower drug prices and planned tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.

          <p>China's highest court has released a selection of 12 legal rulings to demonstrate how the country's landmark private sector law is being enforced, aiming to boost confidence among private business owners. The cases, drawn from various court levels, are intended to guide the judiciary and showcase a commitment to equal treatment, innovation protection, and the lawful growth of private enterprises. Many of the highlighted disputes involved private companies against state-backed entities, such as a case where a medical device manufacturer successfully sued a state hospital for non-payment. This move is part of a broader effort to provide stronger legal safeguards for private economic development.</p>

          <p>A company named Turf Tank is revolutionizing the maintenance of athletic fields by using GPS-guided robots to paint boundary lines for sports like soccer and football. This technology significantly reduces the time and labor required, allowing one person to line a field in about 35-40 minutes, compared to nearly two hours for a team of three. The robots, controlled by a tablet, offer high precision and efficiency, which has proven crucial for large-scale events and daily operations at professional stadiums, colleges, and local parks. Initially met with skepticism, the technology has gained widespread adoption, with thousands of clients now relying on these autonomous systems.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released over $5 billion in federal K-12 education funds after a four-week freeze prompted significant backlash from educators and lawmakers across the political spectrum. The funding, which supports teacher training, after-school programs, and services for English learners, was initially withheld for a review, causing budget crises for school districts nationwide. An informal alliance of rural and urban educators, along with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, pushed back against the hold, arguing it disrupted hiring and planning for the school year. The reversal is seen as a cautionary tale for the administration about the political difficulty of cutting popular education programs.</p>
