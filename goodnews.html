          <p>A Kansas City-based company, Allied Materials, is preparing for a surge in demand as the United States approaches its 250th anniversary in 2026. The factory, which produces about 1,000 American flags per day, is one of the nation's largest, supplying federal agencies and the military. The company prides itself on being vertically integrated, with every component sourced and manufactured within the U.S. For many employees, the work is a personal honor, especially knowing the flags are often used to honor fallen veterans.</p>

          <p>The initial public offering market is showing signs of life after a prolonged drought, largely sparked by the successful debut of crypto company Circle, which has surged sixfold since its IPO. This momentum, along with a few other tech IPOs in June, is providing much-needed optimism for venture capital firms awaiting opportunities to generate returns for their investors. While the market is not fully recovered and high-value private companies remain on the sidelines, analysts see an encouraging trend. The increased activity suggests a "backlog of liquidity" may finally be starting to clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks, as well as deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn and grilled proteins.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history, primarily because it introduced the concept of the "citizen" rather than the "subject." In an interview ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary, Burns argues that the revolution's ideals set in motion movements for equality and self-governance across the globe for centuries. He also emphasizes the importance of embracing America's complex and often contradictory history, stating that understanding these nuances makes the nation's story richer and more accessible to everyone.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested a novel way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States in 2026: staging a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds. During a speech, he floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 people for the event. Trump stated that UFC CEO Dana White, a supporter of the president, would be in charge of organizing the fight. The proposal is unprecedented, as the White House has never before hosted a professional sporting event of this nature.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would harm the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the atoll. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the tests.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China are experiencing a significant surge in the UK market, accounting for one in every ten new cars sold in June. This growth, driven by brands like BYD and MG, marks a sharp increase from previous years and contrasts with other G7 nations that have imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese auto imports. The UK's lack of similar tariffs has created a major opportunity for these brands, particularly in the electric vehicle sector. The trend is reshaping the UK's automotive landscape, raising questions about the future competitiveness of the domestic industry.</p>

          <p>The increasing integration of the Ethereum blockchain into mainstream finance was a central theme at the recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes. Major financial players are now building on Ethereum, using it as the infrastructure for tokenized assets, with Robinhood recently launching on-chain tokenized stocks for European users. This shift from speculative hype to practical utility is driving a new wave of institutional adoption, as firms like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock leverage the network for its stability and security. The trend suggests Ethereum is becoming the foundational plumbing for the future of Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>
