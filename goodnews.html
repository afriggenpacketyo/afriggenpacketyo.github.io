          <p>Reports circulating on Chinese social media falsely claimed that Poland had officially sent troops to Ukraine, escalating the conflict. A fact-check by DW traced these claims to a misinterpretation of comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding military cooperation on drone defense. The Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any joint training activities would occur exclusively on Polish territory. The spread of this disinformation is linked to Chinese content farms aiming to create informational chaos and push pro-Russian narratives.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the storm to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but remain over open water. The current forecast track shows Gabrielle moving north of the Caribbean and away from major landmasses, though it could pass east of Bermuda next week. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins announced that the agency will propose a rule change that could allow public companies to report earnings semiannually instead of quarterly. The move follows a call from President Donald Trump, who argued that less frequent reporting would allow companies to focus on long-term growth. Proponents believe it will reduce short-term market pressure, while opponents worry it will decrease transparency for investors, particularly retail investors. The change could be approved by a majority vote at the SEC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have been released. The couple, who had lived and worked on charitable projects in the country for 18 years, were freed following mediation efforts by Qatar. Their family expressed immense relief, having previously raised concerns about the couple's deteriorating health in detention. The Taliban claimed the pair had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, and they were handed over to the UK's Special Envoy to Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>According to a recent survey from ZipRecruiter, the job search process has accelerated for many workers, with nearly half of new hires finding a role within a month. Candidates are also sending fewer applications before receiving an offer, suggesting a better alignment between job seeker expectations and employer needs. While salary gains have slowed, job seekers are prioritizing stability, good company culture, and schedule flexibility. The healthcare sector remains strong, and anticipatory hiring is picking up in retail and transportation ahead of the holiday season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has advocated for the central bank to implement two more interest rate cuts before the end of the year. He believes the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," allowing room for more accommodative monetary policy. Despite core inflation running above the Fed's 2% target, Kashkari points to a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations as justification for further easing. The Fed recently cut its benchmark rate to a range between 4% and 4.25%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" policy, which was enacted in July. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 through 2028, with the benefit phasing out for higher earners. Officials clarified that the deduction does not apply to workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. In this system, a third-party middleman company purchases goods from the retailer at a wholesale price and then handles the sale and shipment to the U.S. consumer. This allows the tariff to be paid on the lower wholesale value rather than the final retail price, significantly cutting costs. While this strategy helps retailers avoid passing costs to customers, some logistics experts question its long-term scalability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article challenges the widely cited United Nations projections that forecast a drastic decline in China's population by the end of the century. The author questions the methodology, noting that the same models predict significant growth for the United States without clear justification for the divergence. The piece contrasts the UN data with forecasts from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities, which suggest a more moderate scenario with a population of around 1.12 billion. The article implies that pessimistic demographic forecasts for China should be viewed with skepticism.</p>
