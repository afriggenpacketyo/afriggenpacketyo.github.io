          <p>Small colleges like Roanoke College are reintroducing football programs after decades, hoping to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men, who are attending college at lower rates. While administrators report initial success in balancing gender ratios and boosting school spirit, research suggests that any enrollment spikes from adding football are typically short-lived. Despite this, institutions see the strategy as a way to create a more vibrant campus and attract a different pool of students in a competitive higher education landscape. The move is part of a broader strategy to ensure institutional viability.</p>

          <p>Child development and education experts are urging parents to proactively discuss generative artificial intelligence with their children, starting from an early age. They recommend that parents learn about AI tools themselves and explore them alongside their kids to teach responsible and ethical usage. While AI can be a helpful learning aid if used correctly, there are significant risks, including the potential for chatbots to provide unsafe responses regarding mental health crises. The guidance emphasizes setting household rules, prioritizing real-life interaction, and fostering open communication about the technology's benefits and dangers.</p>

          <p>Voters in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, are heading to the polls for local elections, which are being viewed as a significant political test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition government. The election is also a crucial moment for state Premier Hendrik Wüst, who governs with the Green Party and is considered a potential successor to Merz. Opinion polls suggest potential gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in some industrial areas. The results will provide a key indicator of the current political climate and the standing of the major parties in Germany.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court stated that the company removed the account without clear justification and applied its nudity and sexual services policies inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to revise its terms to provide clearer mechanisms for appealing moderation decisions. This decision underscores the protection of social media posts under Colombian law and adds to a trend of South American courts holding platforms accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team is set to face England in a World Cup quarter-final, renewing a rivalry that has been overwhelmingly one-sided for over two decades. Scotland has not defeated England since 1999, with the gap between the two teams widening significantly since England's professionalization of the sport. Despite being the underdogs, Scotland has shown steady improvement, rising to sixth in world rankings. The match comes amid uncertainty over coaching and player contracts, but former players express hope that the team's performance can secure greater investment and continuity for the sport in Scotland.</p>

          <h2>Boxing Experts Divided on Outcome of Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford Super-Middleweight Bout</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing analysts are offering conflicting predictions for the highly anticipated fight between Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez and Terence “Bud” Crawford. One perspective holds that Crawford's superior technical skill, speed, and adaptability will allow him to outbox Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, other experts argue that Canelo's significant size and power advantage at the 168lb limit will ultimately overwhelm Crawford, who appeared less dominant in his last fight at a lower weight. The bout is seen as a clash between Crawford's pound-for-pound brilliance and Canelo's proven strength and experience at super-middleweight.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption demonstrations, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim prime minister, making her the first woman to hold the position. The youth-led "GenZ" protests led to the collapse of the previous government and the dissolution of parliament, with new elections scheduled for March 5. Calm has reportedly returned to the capital, Kathmandu, as Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, takes office. Her appointment was the result of negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives after a social media ban sparked widespread unrest.</p>

The initiative, starting with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have a senior professional title. While the program is initially limited in scope, it is seen by some as a positive step toward supporting women in demanding scientific careers.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever detected in our solar system, which was identified on July 1. Confirmed to be a comet traveling at an exceptionally high speed of 60 kilometers per second, it is too fast for the sun's gravity to capture. Observations, including from the James Webb Space Telescope, reveal an unusual composition with a high abundance of carbon dioxide compared to comets from our solar system. Though its nucleus is estimated to be small, its dusty coma has made detailed analysis challenging, but astronomers anticipate better data when it makes a close approach to Mars in October.</p>

          <p>This article frames the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday album as a product of a culture in the 1970s and 80s that normalized the sexual exploitation of underage girls by adult men. The author recounts how movies, music, and mainstream attitudes of the era frequently excused or even celebrated such relationships, leaving girls vulnerable. The piece argues that the rise of feminism was crucial in challenging these norms by establishing principles of consent, exposing power imbalances, and denormalizing abuses like sexual assault and harassment. This cultural shift provides context for understanding the environment that enabled figures like Epstein.</p>
