Acting swiftly and choosing the right approach is crucial, often requiring detailed financial disclosures. Taxpayers can also seek assistance from tax relief professionals who can negotiate with the IRS and request a garnishment release while a resolution is pursued. The article advises immediate action, verifying the amount owed, and documenting financial distress to increase the chances of stopping or reducing wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight individuals were found guilty by a Paris court for their involvement in the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian during Paris Fashion Week, where millions of dollars worth of jewelry were stolen. The court handed down sentences ranging from three to eight years, with most suspended due to the defendants' ages and health issues. Kardashian, who testified during the trial, expressed gratitude to French authorities and stated the incident was a terrifying experience with lasting impacts, though she believes in healing and accountability. The robbers, dubbed the "Grandpa robbers," were mostly in their 60s and 70s, with only two acknowledging their involvement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued that the administration's decision, which accused the university of fostering an unsafe environment and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, violated the First Amendment. The judge's order preserves the status quo pending a hearing, while the White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach. The university's president, Alan Garber, condemned the administration's actions as an unlawful attempt to control Harvard's academic independence.</p>

          <p>A 443-foot container ship, the NCL Salten, ran aground near a cabin in Norway while the homeowner, Johan Helberg, was asleep. The helmsman was reportedly asleep at the time of the incident, causing the ship to sail onto shore just meters from Helberg's house. Helberg discovered the ship after a neighbor alerted him, and while the ship caused damage to a heating pipe, Helberg considers himself lucky that the situation wasn't worse. Norwegian police are investigating the incident, and the shipping company is conducting internal inquiries.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily halted lower court orders requiring the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to release information to a government watchdog group. The stay allows the Supreme Court to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief in a lawsuit testing whether DOGE must comply with federal public records law. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking information about DOGE's operations and personnel.</p>
