          <p>The number of Turkish citizens acquiring German citizenship doubled in 2024, driven by factors such as political repression and economic instability in Turkey. Germany's citizenship reforms in June 2024, allowing dual citizenship, have made it more attractive for Turks to seek German passports. Many Turkish immigrants also desire to participate politically and enjoy the benefits of a German passport, such as visa-free travel to numerous countries.
