          <p>USA Rare Earth, an Oklahoma-based company, is working to increase U.S. production of critical rare earth magnets, essential for technologies like semiconductors and electric cars. Currently, China dominates the rare earth magnet market, producing about 95% of the world's supply, creating a potential choke point for U.S. defense and technology industries. The company is assembling machines to produce up to 5,000 tons of magnets annually, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China. This initiative aligns with efforts to secure domestic supply chains for crucial materials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing trend of food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods and consumer demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. Retailers and food brands are responding by offering items with fewer additives, although nutritionists caution that this can sometimes lead to the omission of essential fortified nutrients. Experts suggest that simplifying formulas and using novel processing technologies can help create less processed products while maintaining food safety and shelf life. The article also discusses the marketing strategies and higher price points associated with low-ingredient food products.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have tested key components of quantum-based network technology in a space flight, marking a step toward building a secure communication system. The laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket, assessing their robustness against vibration and radiation. Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD), sending messages directly through a quantum channel, enhancing security. This test represents China's progress in integrating space and ground systems for advanced, encryption-free communications.</p>

He expressed disappointment that the US was far ahead in production and pushed for increased supplies from Great Britain. While sufficient penicillin was eventually obtained, mainly from the US, it was initially only available for military use, underscoring the critical need for the antibiotic during the war.</p>

The performance blended country clich√©s with Beyonc√©'s signature style, featuring numerous costume changes and appearances by her daughter, Blue Ivy, but some felt the stadium setting wasn't ideal for the country theme.</p>
