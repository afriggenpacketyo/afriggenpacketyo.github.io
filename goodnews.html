          <p>George Lucas's Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles is nearing completion after years of delays, with Lucas himself taking a more direct role in its final stages. The museum recently parted ways with its director and several staff members, leading Lucas to step in as the head of "content direction." The museum aims to explore how narrative art influences societies, but some critics argue that its mission needs to be more clearly defined to avoid being seen as a vanity project. Despite construction setbacks and leadership changes, the museum is expected to open next year, showcasing Lucas's extensive collection, including illustrations, comic books, and memorabilia.</p>

          <p>Democrats are reportedly moving away from using "woke" jargon in an effort to win back voters who have shifted to the right. Prominent party figures have stated that phrases such as "Latinx" alienated ordinary voters and contributed to election losses. The party's emphasis on issues such as pronouns also exhausted the electorate. Democrats are being urged to communicate in a more relatable manner and focus on broader economic issues to connect with a wider range of voters.</p>
