          <h2>China's Exports Increase Despite US Tariffs Due to Increased Trade with Southeast Asia</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a significant decline in exports to the United States following the implementation of tariffs. Exports to ASEAN countries rose by 20.8%, while exports to the U.S. fell by over 21%. Despite the overall export growth, analysts anticipate a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months. The surge in exports could be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canadian actor William Shatner responded to President Trump's repeated suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state of the United States. Shatner deemed Trump's persistence on the matter as insulting, suggesting that Canada should instead offer to make the U.S. the 11th province of Canada. He emphasized Canada's long history and sacrifices in the fight for freedom, asserting that such contributions should not be denigrated. Shatner also highlighted the potential benefits for Americans of joining Canada, including access to poutine, ketchup-flavored chips, and free healthcare.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Show Resilience Despite US Tariffs, Boosting Negotiating Position</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying US President Trump's tariff increases and surpassing market expectations. This strong export growth could strengthen China's negotiating position in upcoming trade talks with the U.S. in Switzerland. The surge in exports may be due to transshipment through other countries and trade contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. However, analysts anticipate a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <h2>Miner Says Addiction to China's Tungsten Is Over Even if Beijing Turns Tap Back On</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 22:36:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Producers of tungsten products in developed nations are recognizing the need to diversify their raw material supply sources following China's export restrictions. China added tungsten to its export restriction list in February, causing panic in the industry, which has relied on Chinese raw materials for 30 years. The element is used to make cutting tools, drill bits, heavy machinery parts, and is a component in certain types of ammunition and armor. The United States defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.</p>
