          <p>Richard Irvine, owner of the Colonsay Smokery on a remote Scottish island, is offering to give away his business for free to the right candidate who commits to living on Colonsay, population 125. Irvine, a 'serial business creator,' established the smokery in 2022 with the intention of passing it on to someone who lacks the capital but desires to own a business. The island, located off the west coast of Scotland, provides an escape from the hustle and bustle of big-city life, though attracting young people to the island has been a challenge. Irvine hopes this opportunity will bring new life to the community, which faces issues with affordable housing and limited job opportunities.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive has adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital spending due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs, despite producing its vehicles in the U.S. The company expects to incur additional expenses per vehicle as a result of tariffs, leading to a reduction in delivery targets from 46,000-51,000 to 40,000-46,000 units, and an increase in capital expenditure guidance from $1.6-1.7 billion to $1.8-1.9 billion. Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plan to achieve a 'modest positive gross profit' this year, as well as $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in losses on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company's first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, supported by its second consecutive quarter of gross profit.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem clarified that travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized document will face additional security screening at U.S. airports starting Wednesday, but will not be barred from flights. This statement reiterates previous guidance from the department as the federal deadline to enforce the Real ID law approaches, which was enacted in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Noem noted that 81 percent of travelers already have compliant identification and emphasized that the law will allow for better identification and authorization of individuals traveling within the country. Travelers are advised to allow extra time at airport security if they do not have a Real ID.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a candid assessment of the job market amid the growing influence of artificial intelligence, advising individuals to embrace AI to remain competitive. Huang stated that while AI will affect every job and some jobs will be lost, individuals will not lose their jobs to AI itself, but to those who leverage it effectively. He recommended learning about AI use cases through software like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Despite Nvidia's significant profit increases, the company's shares have experienced volatility due to concerns about AI chip exports to China and potential capacity overbuild in the U.S., though recent results from tech giants indicate continued strong demand for AI services.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada met with President Trump to assert Canada's sovereignty and avoid a public dispute, succeeding in his goal despite recent tensions over trade and Trump's remarks about annexing Canada. The meeting began with Trump criticizing Canada on social media, but later shifted to a more conciliatory tone in the Oval Office. Carney emphasized that Canada is 'not for sale,' while Trump hinted at potential benefits if Canada were to join the U.S., although no breakthroughs were achieved regarding tariffs or trade agreements. Carney expressed cautious optimism and acknowledged the need for further discussions to improve the trading relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Federal wildlife officials are investigating the stabbing of a 300-pound elephant seal pup on an Oregon beach and are seeking the public's help in identifying the suspect. The seal survived the attack, which occurred on March 16, and has since recovered, prompting officials to release a description and sketch of the suspect. The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits harassing, harming, or killing wild elephant seals, with violations punishable by up to a year in jail and $100,000 in fines. The agency is urging anyone with information to come forward to assist in the investigation.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations and provided a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter, although shares initially rose before declining due to concerns about AI chip export controls. AMD CEO Lisa Su stated that the company's forecast included $800 million in costs incurred because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company's artificial intelligence chips during the quarter, and that they expected about $700 million in lost revenue during the current quarter from export controls, and $1.5 billion in total through the end of AMD's fiscal year. Despite these challenges, AMD's data center segment, driven by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, showed significant growth, and the company is expanding its customer engagements in large-scale AI models.</p>

          <p>Starting May 7, travelers will need a Real ID or another approved form of identification, such as a passport, to board domestic flights, as the U.S. government enforces the Real ID Act after years of postponed deadlines. The Real ID Act sets minimum standards for state-issued documentation to enhance security, requiring individuals to provide a Social Security number, verify their address, and prove their identity and lawful status. While a Real ID is sufficient for domestic flights, it will not allow travelers to cross international borders, and those without compliant identification may still be allowed to fly after additional identity verification.</p>
