          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Canada, focusing on resolving trade tariff issues. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for negotiations to bridge the gap over Trump's tariff policy, with Japan seeking the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. While Japan initially demanded the complete elimination of these duties, they are now considering accepting reduced tariff rates as negotiations continue. Both countries aim to reach a deal swiftly, emphasizing the importance of boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States. The U.S. seeks to reduce its trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>A recall of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II by the FDA due to mislabeling, posing a health risk to consumers. The affected cans, distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, were labeled as "zero sugar" but contained the full sugar content of regular Dr Pepper, approximately 39 grams. This mislabeling can cause issues for individuals who need to avoid sugar, especially those with diabetes, potentially leading to hyperglycemia and related complications. Customers who purchased the recalled cans, bearing the product code XXXXRS05165 and a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date of February 16, 2026, are advised to return them for a full refund or discard them.</p>

This release will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move aims to alleviate distribution shortages and combat suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly in the Gen Z demographic, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk. Data from the CDC indicates that fentanyl and other drugs killed over 31,000 people under 35 in 2021, but this number dropped to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Factors contributing to this shift include wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a trend of less risky drug use among teens. Despite this progress, challenges remain, especially for those struggling with severe addiction and potential funding cuts for addiction services.</p>

          <p>Barbara Kruger's mural "Questions" in downtown Los Angeles has become a backdrop for protests against ICE raids and the deployment of the National Guard. The mural, featuring questions about power and control, is located on the side of the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary building, facing the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. The mural's questions, such as "Who is beyond the law?" and "Who follows orders?", resonate with the themes of the protests. The museum experienced minor damage from graffiti but remained closed as a precaution.</p>
