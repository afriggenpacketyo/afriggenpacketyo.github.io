          <p>English pace bowler Matthew Potts is back in consideration for the prestigious Ashes tour after being released from the T20 squad for an upcoming series against Ireland. This move allows him to play in the County Championship, providing a crucial opportunity to demonstrate his red-ball cricket form ahead of the Ashes squad selection. The decision comes as England faces a potential opening in its pace bowling lineup due to another player's retirement from the format and injury concerns for a senior bowler. Potts, who holds a central contract, now has a clear chance to reclaim his spot in the Test team under coach Brendon McCullum.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.8 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing after no winning tickets were sold for the previous $1.4 billion prize. This new amount ranks as the second-largest jackpot in the history of U.S. lotteries, with a potential cash value of approximately $826.4 million before taxes. The current run has now reached 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, tying the game's record. This streak has generated significant public interest and ticket sales across the 45 states where Powerball is played, as hopeful participants vie for the historic prize.</p>

Norris is seeking to close the championship points gap to his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished fourth fastest in the session. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc secured the second-fastest time, delighting the local fans, while Williams' Carlos Sainz came in third. The practice results set the stage for an intense qualifying session and race, with Norris under pressure to outperform his teammate and gain ground in the driver standings with only nine races left in the season.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals States with the Highest and Lowest Tax Burdens for Powerball Winners</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot climbs to a historic $1.8 billion, an analysis of tax laws reveals significant disparities in take-home winnings depending on the winner's state. While all winners face a federal tax withholding of 24% plus additional federal taxes, some states impose their own income tax on lottery prizes, which can exceed 10%. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep a larger portion of their prize. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York and New Jersey, would result in the lowest after-tax payouts for the jackpot winner.</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial analysts are advising investors to consider defensive strategies to protect their recent portfolio gains. The article highlights concerns about over-concentration in mega-cap tech stocks and suggests that a weakening labor market could signal future economic trouble, despite the market's positive reaction to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Experts recommend re-evaluating portfolio composition, potentially shifting some capital from recent high-performers like tech into value and defensive stocks that have been overlooked. This strategic repositioning is suggested as a prudent measure to insulate against potential market volatility ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Drop to 11-Month Low Amid Expectations of Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024, providing a welcome development for prospective homebuyers. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, as lenders preemptively lower their rates in response to economic signals like new unemployment data. For homebuyers, this cooling trend presents a strategic opportunity, though it may also increase competition in the housing market. Experts advise potential buyers to get pre-approved and check their credit reports to take full advantage of the more favorable borrowing conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order that will create a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, enabling the U.S. to penalize countries that illegally detain American citizens. This measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, will provide the State Department with tools to impose sanctions and potentially travel restrictions. The move is intended to deter nations from using detained Americans as political leverage and to secure the release of those currently held. The order follows several high-profile cases of Americans being wrongfully detained in countries like Russia and Iran, and has been praised by families of former hostages.</p>

          <p>The ownership of "A Young Girl," a 1901 painting by German expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, is under review by Germany's Advisory Commission for Nazi-looted art. The artwork, held by the Hamburger Kunsthalle museum, was donated in 1958 by the widow of a Nazi party art collector. Heirs of Robert Graetz, a Jewish businessman deported by the Nazis, filed a restitution claim in 2020, asserting he was the original owner. This case is one of the last to be heard by the commission before it is replaced by a new system of arbitration tribunals, a change that has drawn criticism for potentially worsening the situation for victims' descendants.</p>
