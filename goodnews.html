          <p>The UK is expected to have a hotter-than-normal summer, increasing the likelihood of heatwaves, according to the Met Office's recent three-month outlook.

          <p>Baltimore Orioles' Coby Mayo faced criticism for his baserunning tactic during a game against the Chicago White Sox, leading to benches clearing. After hitting a single, Mayo ran out of the baseline to avoid a tag, colliding with White Sox infielder Lenyn Sosa, resulting in an exchange of words and a shove from Mayo. The incident prompted both benches and bullpens to clear, though order was eventually restored by the umpires. Mayo defended his actions as an attempt to get into scoring position, while social media users criticized his play as "bush league."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Industry insiders argue that art has an essential role in shaping environmental governance and making direct interventions to combat climate change. Contemporary art can rekindle relationships with the environment and foster care and agency, according to Markus Reymann, co-director of TBA21 Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary. Artist Maja Petric's light installations aim to evoke feelings associated with pristine nature, while historically, artists have reminded society of what might be lost, such as Turner landscapes and Constable skyscapes. Art can bridge the gap by helping people understand challenging concepts and imagine alternative futures, making the climate crisis easier to comprehend and act upon.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience stems from his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, which is crucial to maintaining his viability. The acronym ‚ÄúTACO,‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúTrump Always Chickens Out,‚Äù refers to the perception that Trump is always testing limits but willing to pull back, reassuring swing voters. By checking himself and being checked by others, Trump meets the expectations of an important group of voters who approve of his presidency based on this dynamic interaction. This strategy has allowed Trump to recover from potentially damaging situations and maintain a normal level of approval in a polarized country.</p>

The film, set in 1932 Clarksdale, combines elements of musicals, horror, and period drama to capture the soul of the town's history, struggles, and community. Coogler conducted extensive research in Clarksdale, which inspired the film, and he arranged free screenings for the town's residents, who had previously lacked a movie theater. The town's residents are hopeful that the film will increase tourism and provide a better understanding of their history and culture.</p>
