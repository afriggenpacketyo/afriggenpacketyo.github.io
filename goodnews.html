          <p>Taiwan is preparing to receive a significant influx of long-delayed U.S. military hardware, totaling nearly $4.5 billion in systems currently being delivered. This marks the largest annual volume of arms arrivals in years, aimed at bolstering the island's defense capabilities against increasing threats from Beijing. However, reports submitted to the legislature highlight ongoing delays for key items, such as the F-16V fighter jets and AGM-154C glide bombs, raising questions about whether Taiwan's forces are fully prepared to integrate the new equipment effectively. The total backlog of arms orders from the U.S. currently stands at over $21.5 billion.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, upholding a lower court's decision just before a crucial meeting on interest rates. The divided court ruled that removing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which is designed to protect the central bank from political influence. The decision allows Cook to participate in the upcoming rate-setting vote, thwarting a move that would have allowed Trump to appoint a fourth member and gain a majority on the seven-member board. The case stems from allegations made by a political ally of Trump, which Cook denies.</p>

          <p>A diverse field of candidates running for California governor in 2026 have shared their perspectives on Governor Gavin Newsom's administration and their own priorities if elected. In interviews, Democratic contenders like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's economic management and pushback against the Trump administration, while also identifying areas for improvement, such as housing and healthcare. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco, offered sharp critiques, with Bianco stating Newsom has only done well when "acting like a Republican." The responses highlight key state issues, including the housing crisis, healthcare costs, and public education.</p>

The surge led gains across Asia-Pacific markets and was reportedly influenced by positive sentiment regarding U.S.-China trade negotiations. This new high for the Nikkei, along with gains in the Topix index, reflects a buoyant market atmosphere as investors also anticipate an upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. The positive momentum was also seen in U.S. markets, where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also reached new all-time highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tips and Strategies for Effective Autumn Home Decluttering</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 20:20:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn approaches, many people feel a renewed motivation to organize their living spaces, a process that psychologists say can reduce stress. Experts suggest several strategies for a successful decluttering process, starting with small, manageable tasks like a single drawer to avoid feeling overwhelmed. It is also crucial to plan ahead for where discarded items will go, whether to charity, recycling, or online marketplaces. The advice emphasizes prioritizing quality over quantity by keeping items that are genuinely loved and meaningful, and learning to distinguish between nostalgia for the past and true sentimental value in the present.</p>

          <h2>FDA Reconsiders 'Black Box' Warnings on Menopause Hormone Therapy Amid Evolving Research</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 19:47:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering removing "black box" warnings from some menopause hormone therapy (HRT) treatments, which currently caution against risks like stroke and breast cancer. Many doctors now believe these risks, highlighted by a flawed 2002 study, were overstated and that the study's focus on older women skewed the results. More recent research suggests that when started closer to menopause, HRT is a safe and the most effective treatment for symptoms like hot flashes for many women. This potential change reflects an evolution in scientific understanding, though some experts urge caution before altering the labels.</p>

          <p>Despite their massive gains in recent years, CNBC's Jim Cramer asserts that the best days for the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are not over. He argues that companies like Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia continue to possess the key ingredients for success, including strong management, vast cash reserves, and enormous scale that stifles competition. Cramer pointed to their consistent innovation, such as Apple Watch's new health features, and strong investor confidence, like Elon Musk's recent stock buyback, as reasons for continued optimism. He believes their market dominance and ability to weather setbacks position them for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semi-annual schedule, an idea the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The proposal has reignited a debate on corporate governance, with supporters claiming it would reduce short-term market pressure, while critics argue it would decrease transparency for investors. The change would not require congressional approval and could be implemented by a majority vote at the SEC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Santa Monica may notice the ocean has a pink hue as researchers from UCLA and the Bay Foundation release a nontoxic dye into the water. The study aims to understand how a 1930s-era manmade breakwater may be hindering ocean circulation and contributing to the bay's notoriously poor water quality. By tracking the fluorescent dye's movement, scientists hope to gain insights that could help address the high levels of fecal bacteria often found near the Santa Monica Pier. City officials are hopeful the research will lead to solutions that finally get the popular beach off the state's list of "dirtiest" beaches.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reports it has agreed on a deal framework that would allow TikTok to avoid a U.S. ban, with a new deadline approaching this week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the framework, while Chinese officials confirmed a "basic consensus" has been reached, though specific commercial terms are not yet public. This development addresses long-standing U.S. concerns about the Chinese-owned app's potential for data collection and propaganda dissemination to its 170 million American users. President Trump is scheduled to discuss the terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, potentially resolving a major geopolitical and tech issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal with Chinese-owned ByteDance that would allow the social media app TikTok to continue operating in the United States. This agreement comes ahead of a September 17 deadline that would have otherwise triggered a nationwide ban on the app. While details are still scarce, any deal would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to address national security concerns over data privacy and potential Chinese influence. The move navigates a politically sensitive issue, given TikTok's massive user base of 170 million Americans, particularly among younger voters.</p>
