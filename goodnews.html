          <p>An NPR journalist shares a personal reflection from their time aboard a Doctors Without Borders migrant rescue ship in the Mediterranean Sea. The article describes the exhausting and often traumatic work of the crew, who in one ten-day period saved 258 lives. Amidst the difficult reality of rescuing migrants who paid smugglers for the perilous journey to Europe, a moment of shared joy occurred when a pod of dolphins swam alongside the vessel. This brief encounter provided a powerful reminder of beauty and life persisting even in the face of human cruelty and hardship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that demand for AI computing has risen significantly, particularly over the last six months, as AI models advance from simple queries to complex reasoning. Speaking on CNBC, Huang noted that the company's most advanced GPU, Blackwell, is experiencing very high demand, signaling the start of a "new industrial revolution." He also addressed the immense power requirements for the industry's growth, suggesting that data centers will need to generate their own power, potentially using natural gas or nuclear energy, to meet demand without straining public grids.</p>

          <p>AST SpaceMobile and Verizon have announced a definitive commercial agreement to provide direct-to-device cellular service from space across the continental United States, set to begin next year. The partnership aims to extend Verizon's network coverage to areas that are currently underserved by traditional cell towers. Following the announcement, AST SpaceMobile's stock surged over 15%, continuing a strong yearly performance. The company claims it is building the first and only space-based global cellular network that connects directly to standard mobile devices.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), positioning them as a safe way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation. It lists national average yields for various terms but highlights that top rates, especially from online banks, are significantly higher. For instance, some 6-month CDs offer APYs over 4.40%, while national averages are much lower. The article advises consumers to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs, which currently offer higher rates due to an inverted yield curve, to secure the best returns.

          <p>The first celebrity version of the popular reality show "The Traitors" is set to premiere, featuring a high-profile cast including Sir Stephen Fry, Alan Carr, and Tom Daley. Hosted by Claudia Winkleman, the series will see 19 famous contestants compete in the Scottish highlands for a prize of up to £100,000 for their chosen charities. As in the original format, a few contestants will be secretly designated as "traitors" while the "faithful" majority must identify and eliminate them. The lineup has been praised for its star power, and the show is expected to deliver the same psychological drama and strategic gameplay that made the original a hit.</p>

          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, borrowing against home equity remains a relatively affordable option for homeowners, with average equity levels currently over $300,000. This article details the current national average interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), noting they are significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards. It explains the difference between the two products: fixed-rate lump-sum loans versus variable-rate lines of credit. The article suggests that rates may decline further if the Federal Reserve implements more cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the current national average interest rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinances, acknowledging the challenging market for prospective homebuyers due to high rates and limited inventory. As of October 8, 2025, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.37%. The article suggests that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure good rates and offers advice on how to do so, such as improving credit scores and shopping around with different lenders. It also notes that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 09:11:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her first conference speech as party leader, Kemi Badenoch announced that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the sale of main homes in England and Northern Ireland. The surprise policy announcement is aimed at boosting home ownership and social mobility by freeing up the housing market. The move, estimated to cost between £4.5 billion and £9 billion, would be funded through planned savings from the welfare and foreign aid budgets. The pledge sets a clear dividing line with the Labour government and is part of a broader platform of new policies designed to energize the party's base.</p>

          <p>The players' unions for the WNBA and the NWSL, the two most prominent women's professional sports leagues in the U.S., have developed a strong collaborative relationship to advocate for their members. This solidarity was recently highlighted when NWSL players wore shirts supporting the WNBPA's campaign for a new collective bargaining agreement. The unions, both relatively young compared to their male counterparts, work together on issues like fair pay, player safety, and protections for mothers. They also coordinate on broader political advocacy, such as opposing federal immigration raids and addressing potential threats to Title IX in proposed legislation for college athletes.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women are buying and cultivating chinampas, the ancient island farms built by the Aztecs in the wetlands of what is now Mexico City, to save a threatened ecosystem. Traditionally, these lands were not inherited by women, but a new generation is working to restore them using sustainable, traditional methods in an area dominated by men. Their efforts focus on preserving a unique agricultural system threatened by urban sprawl, pollution, and mass tourism. By reviving practices like using canal mud for fertilizer, they are also helping to protect the habitat of the endangered axolotl and maintain the ecological stability of the region.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Make Me Commissioner," a new book by veteran sportswriter Jane Leavy that examines the state of modern baseball and proposes ideas for its improvement. Leavy argues that the sport, a "nineteenth-century construct," is struggling to maintain its relevance and has become overloaded with data and analytics at the expense of its "human element." The book is presented as a "barnstorming tour" of baseball, featuring conversations with players, managers, and innovators about how to make the game more accessible and engaging for new generations. While the reviewer notes recent rule changes have already improved the pace of play, Leavy's book is celebrated as a compelling love letter to the game's traditions.</p>

          <p>Despite not formally recognizing the Taliban regime, India is hosting Afghanistan's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, for a week-long visit. This move is seen as a significant strategic pivot by New Delhi, allowing it to increase engagement with Kabul's de facto rulers without granting official recognition. The visit comes as the Taliban's relationship with its traditional backer, Pakistan, has soured, creating an opportunity for India to regain strategic influence in the region. Discussions are expected to cover counterterrorism, trade, and humanitarian aid, as the Taliban seeks to expand its diplomatic footprint beyond Pakistan and China.</p>

          <p>Amazon is launching prescription drug kiosks in some of its One Medical clinics in Los Angeles, a move that further integrates its healthcare and retail ambitions. The machines, operated by Amazon Pharmacy, function like vending machines and can dispense hundreds of common medications like antibiotics and inhalers within minutes of a doctor's visit. The company aims to remove the barrier of a separate trip to a pharmacy, which often results in prescriptions going unfilled. This initiative represents a new challenge to traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens, which are already facing financial pressures and increased competition.</p>
