          <p>Hong Kong has passed a bill to regulate stablecoins, requiring issuers to obtain licenses and comply with asset reserve management and client asset segregation requirements. The new law aims to enhance Hong Kong's virtual asset regulatory framework, fostering financial stability and encouraging innovation. This policy is expected to take effect later this year, providing the industry with sufficient time to adapt. The legislation sets a global benchmark by mandating full reserve backing and strict redemption guarantees, positioning Hong Kong as a leader in compliant digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nike plans to raise prices on certain trainers and clothing starting June 1, following Adidas's warning of price hikes due to U.S. tariffs. While Nike did not explicitly cite U.S. tariffs, the company stated it regularly makes price adjustments. Tariffs are generally paid by the importing company and can be passed on to consumers. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with clothing and equipment also seeing increases, but popular Air Force 1 trainers and children's products will be exempt.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has announced a breakthrough in developing a hypersonic engine powered by ordinary jet fuel, reigniting discussions about a technology proposed by the US military decades ago. The team successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber, simulating flight conditions at Mach 8 and an altitude of 30km. The experiment sustained stable detonation waves for over two seconds, potentially proving the concept's feasibility for military applications. The ODE concept promises propulsion without moving parts by coupling shock waves with combustion.</p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring the use of airborne DNA to track the world's biodiversity, with the goal of monitoring entire countries for changes in species populations. By analyzing DNA captured on air filters, researchers can identify a wide range of organisms, including insects, plants, fungi, birds, and mammals. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective method for monitoring biodiversity and detecting pathogens or agricultural pests. The technique could potentially transform air quality networks into global wildlife monitoring systems.</p>
