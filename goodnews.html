          <p>New York Yankees star Aaron Judge commented that former President Donald Trump's presence at their game against the Detroit Tigers provided a confidence boost for the team. Following a pre-game meeting with Trump, the Yankees secured a 9-3 victory, with Judge hitting two home runs. Judge humorously suggested that the team should have Trump around more often given their strong offensive performance. Trump, who was in attendance on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, later praised Judge's athletic ability during a television appearance.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly acknowledged being inspired by data analytics firm Palantir, particularly its high market valuation, while also remarking on its expensive software prices. During a technology conference, Benioff noted that Palantir's prices are the "most expensive enterprise software" he's ever seen, humorously questioning if he should raise his own company's prices. This commentary continues a public rivalry between the two tech leaders, whose companies occasionally compete for significant government and enterprise contracts, adding another layer to their competitive dynamic.</p>

The builder, KPC Development Co., confirmed that the 300-room luxury hotel will be ready by September of next year, well ahead of Super Bowl 61. The hotel is a key part of the larger Hollywood Park development and is designed to cater to visiting sports teams, entertainers, and fans.

Cameron Norrie secured the first point with a hard-fought 7-6, 6-4 victory over Tomasz Berkieta. Following him, Arthur Fery, making an unexpected Davis Cup debut due to an injury to a teammate, won his match against Olaf Pieczkowski 6-4, 6-2. Great Britain now needs just one more win on Saturday to secure their spot in February's first round and maintain their status among the tennis elite.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox delivered a message urging young Americans to reject political rage and choose a path of healthier disagreement. Known for his "Disagree Better" initiative, Cox has built a political brand around combating polarization and promoting civil debate. He framed the shooting as a tragic result of a toxic political climate and called for a return to reasonable conversations where violence is not an option. Cox's appeal for unity stands as a notable example of his consistent effort to lower the political temperature in the country.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who cite challenges such as high costs, dependency on Asia for batteries, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Carmakers are advocating for a relaxation of the regulations to allow for other low-emission technologies, like hybrids, beyond 2035. Environmental groups, however, are urging the EU to remain firm on the original deadline to drive innovation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion held in money market funds. Some economists believe that as yields on these cash-equivalent accounts fall, a significant portion of this money will flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, potentially fueling a market rally. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds belong to institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift their strategy. They contend that only a return to near-zero interest rates would cause a substantial outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to remember several key factors to capitalize on the opportunity. Experts suggest that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best window to act may be brief. It is also crucial for buyers to have a high credit score to qualify for the most favorable rates. Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of getting pre-approved to make serious offers and advises against waiting for even lower rates if the right home is already available.
