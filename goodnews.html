          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing extradition to the United States after evading authorities for 21 years. He was recently apprehended in a remote cottage in north Wales, having been the prime suspect in 2003 bombings linked to animal rights extremist groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. Former FBI agents revealed "missed opportunities" to arrest him before his disappearance, including finding a suspected bomb-making factory in his abandoned car. His five-day extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London will determine if the UK hands him over to the US to face charges for maliciously damaging and destroying property with explosives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers in much of the UK can anticipate a total lunar eclipse this evening, which will transform the full Moon into a striking red "Blood Moon" as it passes through Earth's shadow. The full eclipse occurs between 18:30 and 19:52, with visibility in the UK depending on moonrise times in different regions. Dr. Edward Bloomer of the Royal Observatory Greenwich explains this phenomenon as Rayleigh scattering, the same effect responsible for red sunsets, where Earth's atmosphere refracts light onto the lunar surface. The article provides guidance on optimal viewing and notes that the next UK-visible lunar eclipse is expected in August 2026.</p>

The fortunate ticketholders will split the substantial prize, choosing between a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million or 30 increasing annual payments. This significant win concludes a long streak, bringing excitement to the lottery and highlighting the slim odds of such a massive payout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, where they addressed the growing threat of oligarchic control and rallied support for progressive policies. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, condemned capitalistic greed and vowed to implement rent freezes, increase housing, and raise taxes for the wealthiest New Yorkers, drawing strong applause. Sanders lauded Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail," criticizing both billionaires funding opposition and mainstream Democrats for their muted support. The event highlighted a united front against perceived authoritarianism and for immigrant rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, generate a strong force. Scientists can control light flow to direct these "jumpers" up to 1.5 meters into the air or enable them to swim. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, demonstrates cavitation's efficiency as a launching mechanism, opening new possibilities for micro-robotics and highlighting advancements in material science.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball memorabilia after a viral incident where an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him during a game. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, but an adult man initially retrieved it and gave it to him, only for a woman to demand it, claiming it was hers. Although the ball was taken from the boy, both the Phillies and Marlins organizations stepped in to ensure he had a memorable experience. He was gifted a Marlins swag bag by a staffer and later met Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who gave him an autographed baseball bat.</p>
