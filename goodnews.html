          <p>Portugal secured a 2-1 victory over Germany in the Nations League semifinal, marking Joshua Kimmich's 100th appearance for the German national team with a loss. Kimmich assisted Florian Wirtz's goal, but Portugal responded with goals from Francisco Conceicao and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played his 220th game for his country, eclipsing Kimmich's milestone. Kimmich acknowledged Germany's shortcomings and lack of energy, while Ronaldo's goal was his 137th for Portugal, setting a record in international football, leading his country to another Nations League final. The match, initially delayed due to a storm, ended with Germany missing a crucial pass, solidifying Portugal's win and dampening Kimmich's celebratory night. The article reflects on Kimmich's career with the German national team, noting both highs and lows, including the Confederations Cup win in 2017 and subsequent disappointing tournaments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK newspapers highlight Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring payments but clawing them back from wealthier pensioners via higher taxes. Concerns arise over potential chaos as tax officials might pursue bereaved families of dead pensioners to recover the sums. The Daily Express emphasizes support for a full U-turn, while the i Paper reports 1.3 million more people will likely receive the payment. Immigration policies also take center stage, with opposing views from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. The Telegraph notes Reeves has been "forced to drop net zero cuts," and the Financial Times reports Trump's tax bill will swell US debt. The Daily Mirror celebrates 500,000 more children receiving free school meals.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their school earlier in the year.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber sheds light on the evolution of flight feathers, which were crucial for birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers analyzed 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, gaining insight into feather evolution during this era. The development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was essential for the evolution of birds. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly, although some could glide or had powered flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to beneficial bacteria in newborns can significantly reduce the risk of lung infections requiring hospitalization. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, found that babies with Bifidobacterium longum were less likely to be hospitalized for lung infections. Researchers believe this protective effect is linked to the bacteria's interaction with the immune system and its role in digesting breast milk. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding, due to unknown risks to unborn babies. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward. There are concerns that the popularity of these drugs leads to unsafe usage and lack of proper medical advice. The MHRA also advises those using Mounjaro and taking oral contraceptives to use condoms or switch to another method, as weight-loss jabs may reduce the pill's effectiveness in overweight or obese women.</p>
