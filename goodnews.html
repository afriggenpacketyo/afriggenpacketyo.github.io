          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend some reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. reduced tariffs imposed on China to 30% from 145%, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain a portion of the tariffs for negotiation, and China agreed to suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. The two nations will establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns, aiming to iron out details for their future trade relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees utilizing medicinal plants to treat injuries, showcasing a form of 'forest first aid.' Researchers observed chimpanzees applying plants to their own wounds and, in some instances, tending to the wounds of other chimps, even those unrelated. This behavior includes dabbing plants on wounds or chewing them and applying the chewed material to open injuries. The study, published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, suggests that chimpanzees possess a capacity for empathy and builds on previous findings that they consume specific plants for self-medication, with many of these plants exhibiting antibacterial properties.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which provide personalized wealth management services to the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth, but struggle to find qualified money managers. The demand for talent is outpacing the supply, as family offices face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds. While trust is a key criterion for hiring, family offices also seek professionals who can combine multiple roles, such as chief investment officer and CFO, which is a difficult combination to find. European family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent, including bonuses, co-investment opportunities, and profit sharing.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that Canadians were not pleased with the UK government's decision to extend a second state visit invitation to Donald Trump.

In response, Carney has invited King Charles to open the Canadian parliament as a symbol of sovereignty. The situation highlights tensions between the UK and Canada regarding their approaches to managing relations with the U.S. under President Trump.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will lift sanctions on Syria and plans to meet with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia. The decision to lift sanctions was met with celebration in Damascus, as the previous sanctions had blocked foreign financing, including aid. Trump stated that this policy change would give Syria "a chance at greatness." However, concerns remain regarding the protection of ethnic minorities, particularly after mass killings of civilians from the Alawite sect during clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists, as well as clashes between Islamist factions and the Druze religious minority.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan aims to be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address U.S. concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

Speaking after a town hall in Iowa, Buttigieg acknowledged that, in hindsight, most people would likely agree with that assessment. Despite this, he defended Biden's cognitive abilities during his term, emphasizing that Biden was effective and engaged, particularly during the Baltimore bridge collapse. Buttigieg's visit to Iowa has sparked speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, although he remains coy about his future plans.</p>
