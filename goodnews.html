Financial experts advise that storing emergency funds in a high-yield account is a safe way to make money grow faster due to much higher compounding interest. To secure the best rates, consumers are encouraged to explore options at online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and to compare various accounts based on interest rates and potential fees.

          <h2>Harvard Professor Explains How Active Listening Can Boost Workplace Influence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for becoming more influential and likable at work. This technique involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said, which showcases competence and builds trust. Research indicates that this practice correlates with positive performance reviews and career success, as it demonstrates empathy and a willingness to learn, making it a crucial skill for professional and personal relationships.</p>

The firm purchased more Cisco shares following an analyst downgrade, arguing that the market undervalues the company's momentum in AI and its shift toward subscription revenue. It also added to its Honeywell position after the stock fell despite a strong quarterly report, believing headwinds in its aerospace and energy sectors are temporary and that the company's strategic changes are not yet fully appreciated.

          <p>Under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago, Boeing is reportedly stabilizing after years of crises, with airplane deliveries hitting an 18-month high and the company expected to generate cash in the second half of the year. Ortberg's hands-on approach and presence in Seattle are credited with improving the company culture and restoring some confidence among customers like Ryanair. Despite this progress, Boeing still faces significant challenges, including an FAA production cap on the 737 Max and delays in certifying new aircraft models.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire" to end five days of intense border fighting that killed at least 33 people and displaced tens of thousands. The deal was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who mediated the talks after pressure from the U.S. to halt the conflict. The fighting had escalated from small arms fire to the use of heavy artillery and rockets, causing significant civilian casualties. Both nations will now need to de-escalate and pull back reinforced armies from the border.</p>

          <p>During a visit to his golf resort in Scotland, President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a major trade agreement with the European Union, averting a potential trade war. The deal sets a 15% tariff for most EU imports, including vehicles, while the EU has agreed to purchase more U.S. military hardware and energy and open its markets to U.S. goods with zero tariffs. Trump hailed it as "the biggest deal ever made," while EU leader Ursula von der Leyen said it would bring stability and predictability to the $2 trillion trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. trade deals with Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which lower American tariffs in exchange for near-zero tariffs on U.S. goods, could create new challenges and opportunities for the European Union. While some European exports may face increased competition from American products in these markets, analysts believe the agreements could also pressure Southeast Asian nations to offer similar low-tariff terms to the EU. This dynamic comes as the EU pursues its own free trade agreements with countries like Thailand and Indonesia, potentially strengthening its negotiating position.</p>

This development continues a trend of Chinese tech firms releasing increasingly powerful and cost-effective AI models, intensifying competition in the global artificial intelligence landscape.</p>

          <p>A coalition of survivors and advocates is urging New York lawmakers to pass a bill that would close a legal loophole affecting sexual assault cases involving voluntary intoxication. Currently, it is difficult to prosecute cases where a survivor was intoxicated by choice, a standard that advocates argue denies justice and wrongly implies that drinking alcohol negates a person's right to protection. The proposed legislation, which has bipartisan support but has stalled for years, would ensure that incapacitation, whether voluntary or not, is recognized as an inability to give consent.</p>

This policy marks a significant step towards direct financial support for families, aiming to ease the economic burden of raising children. However, some economists caution that the subsidy amount is likely too small to significantly impact the birth rate or household consumption in the near term.</p>

It explains that heightened sensitivity can be influenced by both genetic temperament and life experiences, such as past trauma or rejection. While being attuned to emotions isn't inherently negative, constant hurt feelings can disrupt relationships. The article offers coping strategies, such as questioning worst-case assumptions, evaluating the long-term significance of a perceived slight, and learning to communicate feelings constructively rather than reacting impulsively.</p>

The legislation would allow municipalities to approve residential projects more quickly by circumventing complex planning rules and would automatically approve applications after two months unless vetoed. While the construction industry welcomes the move as a way to ease approvals, some critics and environmentalists worry it will lead to unchecked development and that it fails to address the core economic issues hindering construction, such as high interest rates.</p>
