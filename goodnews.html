          <p>General Motors announced third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, prompting the company to raise its full-year financial guidance. The automaker reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, beating expectations and signaling strength heading into the final quarter. Despite this positive performance, GM's net income was impacted by charges related to its pullback from all-electric vehicles, with profitability in the EV sector taking longer than anticipated. The company also lowered its expected financial impact from tariffs, crediting recent updates from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has revealed a new plan aimed at stimulating business growth by cutting bureaucratic red tape. The proposed reforms intend to simplify corporate rules, such as eliminating "needless form filling" and reforming the company merger process, which is projected to save businesses nearly £6bn annually. While business groups have welcomed the initiative, some express skepticism, noting that the true test will be whether the government avoids raising employer taxes in the upcoming budget. The measures are part of a broader government pledge to reduce the administrative cost of regulation by a quarter.</p>

Takaichi, a disciple of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is expected to revive expansive fiscal and monetary policies. She also faces imminent diplomatic challenges, including a visit from U.S. President Donald Trump and pressure to increase defense spending amid regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and John Barrasso are formally nominating former President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his leadership of "Operation Warp Speed." The initiative was a public-private partnership that accelerated the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in 2020. The senators, both former doctors, credit the program with saving millions of lives by bringing a vaccine to market in record time. This nomination follows other GOP efforts to secure the prize for Trump, including for his role in the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, for which he was ultimately not selected.</p>

          <p>Wing Louis Rees-Zammit has been recalled to the Wales national rugby squad for their upcoming autumn Tests, marking his return to international rugby after an 18-month detour into American football. The 24-year-old, who had contracts with the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars but did not play a competitive game, recently signed with the Bristol Bears. The 39-man squad, led by new head coach Steve Tandy, also includes recalls for prop Rhys Carre and fly-half Callum Sheedy. The team features five uncapped players as Wales, currently ranked 12th, prepares for a challenging series of matches against top-tier opponents.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill is leading a comeback strategy focused on innovation and rebuilding relationships with wholesale partners to counter slowing growth and stiff competition from brands like On Running and Hoka. The company has reorganized its structure around specific sports to "bring back the sharpness of sport" and compete more directly with rivals. Hill acknowledged that Nike's previous strategy of prioritizing direct-to-consumer sales created a vacuum on retail shelves that competitors filled, and the company must now work to earn that space back. The new approach aims to restore trust with consumers and re-establish Nike's dominance in the sportswear market.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history by winning a parliamentary vote to become Japan's first female prime minister. Her victory was secured after her ruling Liberal Democratic Party formed a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party. As a hardline conservative and a proponent of "Abenomics," Takaichi is expected to pursue policies of loose monetary control and increased fiscal spending. On the geopolitical front, she is known for her firm stance toward China and her support for revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Her appointment caused an initial rally in the Nikkei 225, though gains were later erased as markets assessed the new political landscape.</p>

          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when police arrested a man who had allegedly threatened a mass shooting. The suspect's family alerted authorities after he posted on social media that he was heading to the airport with an assault rifle. Police located and arrested the 49-year-old man, who is a felon with known mental health challenges, shortly after he arrived and was seen scanning the terminal. An AR-15 with 27 rounds of ammunition was found in his truck, and officials believe he was returning to retrieve the weapon when he was apprehended.</p>

The Blue Jays secured home-field advantage with a stronger regular-season record. The series marks a significant moment for the Canadian franchise and its fanbase, who will rally behind stars like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as they face a formidable Dodgers team led by Shohei Ohtani.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Ants Alter Nest Architecture to Prevent Disease Spread</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 07:13:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research shows that black garden ants actively redesign their nests to reduce the transmission of deadly pathogens. When exposed to a lethal fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized and less interconnected nests, increasing the distance between entrances and creating longer travel routes. This "architectural immunity" complements their known social distancing behaviors, such as self-isolation by infected individuals, to effectively protect the colony's most valuable members, like the queen. Scientists suggest these findings could offer inspiration for human public health, demonstrating how physical spaces can be designed to mitigate the spread of epidemics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of U.S. federal judges, including those appointed by Republicans, are issuing strong rebukes to the Trump administration's policies on crime, immigration, and the deployment of troops. Rulings have sharply questioned the administration's sweeping claims of emergency powers, with judges bluntly rejecting factual assertions as "unreliable" or "untethered to the facts." Legal scholars note this judicial pushback signifies a robust defense of the rule of law against expanding executive power. While these lower court decisions have slowed some controversial policies, their ultimate fate may rest with the conservative-majority Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The German government has placed an order for 20 Eurofighter Typhoon jets, one of the world's most advanced combat aircraft, in a move to bolster its air force. Manufactured by a consortium including Airbus, the jets are expected to be delivered between 2031 and 2034. The Eurofighter Typhoon is known for its high speed, maneuverability, and advanced weaponry and sensor systems, as well as its stealth characteristics due to a low percentage of metal in its construction. This procurement is seen as a significant step in modernizing Germany's military capabilities and strengthening its role within the NATO alliance.</p>
