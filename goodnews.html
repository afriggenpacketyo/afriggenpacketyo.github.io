        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a 7% decline in extended trading following the release of a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast by the security software company. While the company's earnings per share surpassed expectations at 73 cents versus an expected 65 cents, revenue aligned with projections at $1.10 billion. The company's costs increased in sales and marketing as well as in research and development and administration, partly because of a broad software outage last summer. For the current quarter, CrowdStrike anticipates adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents on revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, while analysts expected 81 cents per share and $1.16 billion in revenue. (not investment advice) The optimism score considers the mixed financial performance and the company's future outlook.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Bakersfield with a rare medical condition has been granted humanitarian protection from deportation, allowing her to continue receiving lifesaving treatment in the United States. The Trump administration had previously rescinded the legal protections of the girl and her parents, who are from Mexico, making them vulnerable to deportation. The girl's doctor stated that she could die within days of losing her medical care for short bowel syndrome. The humanitarian parole was granted after advocacy from lawmakers and public support, enabling the girl to receive the necessary medical care. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome for the family and the preservation of the child's life.</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing the image taken in January that had drawn comparisons to a mugshot. In the new photograph, Trump stares directly into the camera, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie. The backdrop is dark and blank, contrasting with the previous portrait that was criticized for its lighting and perceived menacing stare. The new portrait aims to reflect the "optimism and resolve of America," according to a White House official. The optimism score is based on the attempt to project a more positive image of the president.</p>
