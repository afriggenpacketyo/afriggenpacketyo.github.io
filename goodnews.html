          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano located on the Italian island of Sicily, erupted, releasing hot ash and lava. The nation's volcano monitoring body reported increasing intensity of explosions from the Southeast Crater, leading to a lava fountain and pyroclastic flow. While the local population is accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions, there were no immediate reports of risks to residents or air travel. This eruption follows a significant event just over a year ago, continuing Etna's pattern of at least one eruption per year, sometimes dusting nearby towns without major disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a decline in sales across Europe. This increase is primarily attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which meets Norwegian preferences for large luggage space, high ground clearance, all-wheel drive, and a tow hitch. Despite this success, a recent survey indicates that political reasons, particularly CEO Elon Musk's activities and rhetoric, may deter some consumers from purchasing Teslas. Norway's robust EV incentives and well-developed charging infrastructure contribute to its leading position in electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>Representative Maxine Waters' 2020 campaign committee, Citizens for Waters, has agreed to pay a $68,000 fine for violating multiple campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) found the committee failed to accurately report receipts and disbursements, knowingly accepted excessive contributions, and made prohibited cash disbursements. As part of the agreement, the committee will also send its treasurer to a Commission-sponsored training program for political committees. Waters' campaign maintained that the violations were unintentional errors and that legal counsel was retained to ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed student loan changes could significantly alter repayment options for borrowers. The plan includes fewer repayment plans, featuring an updated standard plan and a new income-based Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Undergraduates would face a borrowing cap of $50,000, while graduate borrowers would have caps of $100,000 or $150,000 for professional programs. The proposal also aims to remove deferment and forbearance options, limiting borrowers' ability to pause payments during economic hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Silver prices have risen over the past year, currently around $33 per ounce, and analysts predict further gains to $40 per ounce by year-end. However, the economy's performance and Federal Reserve policies will play a significant role in silver's price movement. While silver can serve as a hedge against market volatility, its historical volatility and moderate compound annual growth rate make it a less attractive option for high returns. Experts recommend allocating 5-10% of a portfolio to precious metals, considering both silver and gold for diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to remodel flight paths to potentially shorten journey times, reduce delays, and increase flight capacity. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established around 70 years ago, with an initial focus on the airspace around London. While changes are not expected for several years, ministers say the plans could enable quicker takeoffs and smoother descents. Environmental groups, however, have expressed concerns that the redesign could expose more communities to noise and air pollution.</p>

          <p>A first-of-its-kind international study has found that colon cancer patients experienced improved survival rates after participating in a three-year exercise program. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, demonstrated that the benefits of exercise rivaled those of some drugs in keeping the disease at bay. Patients in the structured exercise program had 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause after eight years. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>
