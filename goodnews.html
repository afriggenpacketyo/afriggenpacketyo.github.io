          <h2>Expert Advocates for Emotionally Safe Parenting Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert proposes a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" that focuses on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions, responding without shame, viewing misbehavior as a stress signal, and taking responsibility after conflicts. Emotionally safe parents create an environment where children feel safe expressing big emotions and showing up as their authentic selves. This parenting style encourages parents to reflect on their own childhood triggers, see behavior as communication, and set boundaries with empathy rather than control, fostering resilience and connection in their children.</p>

Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for a more dignified approach, leading to the current practice of in-person notifications with additional support. Her work has had a lasting impact, providing comfort and recognition to grieving families. In 2023, the Pentagon renamed Ft. Benning to Ft.
