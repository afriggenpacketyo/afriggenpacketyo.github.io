This comes amid a tumultuous period for Musk, who has been in public feuds with President Trump and recently saw the departure of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. These developments occur as Tesla navigates investor concerns over slowing sales and the potential impact of Musk's political disputes on the company.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The judge certified a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all children who would be affected, ruling that depriving them of U.S. citizenship constitutes irreparable harm. The lawsuit challenges the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has granted citizenship to those born on U.S. soil for over a century.</p>

          <p>A resident in Brighton, Boston, has created a "not mail" box outside her home, inviting neighbors and strangers to anonymously share thoughts, poems, and secrets. The project, which began during the pandemic as a way to foster connection, has received a range of responses from silly to deeply heartfelt. The creator, Jean Powers, says the box allows her to "look into the hearts and souls of strangers" and feel a sense of human connection in an increasingly distant world.</p>
