        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of today, all general practitioner practices in England are mandated by the government to offer online appointment booking services throughout the entire workday. The policy aims to eliminate the "8am scramble" where patients compete for limited slots via phone, allowing them to request appointments and describe symptoms online. However, the British Medical Association has raised concerns that the system could overwhelm practices with an "online triage tsunami." Many patients have also reported that despite the new rule, they are still facing difficulties with availability at their local surgeries.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Pfizer has agreed to lower the prices of some of its prescription drugs for American consumers and Medicaid, President Trump announced. The discounted medications will be available through a new federal website to be called "TrumpRx." Pfizer's CEO indicated the move was motivated by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured abroad, with the company also committing to moving more production to the U.S. While the White House touts major savings, some health policy experts remain skeptical about the plan's broad impact.</p>

Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in the parent company, Occidental Petroleum, following a major investment in 2019.

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary order allowing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to continue in her position, blocking an attempt by President Trump to remove her. The case, which the court will hear in January, centers on the president's authority to fire a governor from the independent central bank "for cause." President Trump sought to oust Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, amid his broader criticism of the Fed's interest rate policies. This decision maintains the central bank's operational independence from political pressure for the time being.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a major initiative to reformulate its private-label food products, pledging to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients like artificial sweeteners and certain preservatives by 2027. The change will impact around 1,000 products across its store brands as the retailer responds to growing consumer demand for simpler ingredients. This move aligns with broader industry trends and increased federal scrutiny on artificial food additives. Consumer advocacy groups have praised the decision, noting that as the largest grocer in the U.S., Walmart's policy will have a significant market impact.</p>

The organization was originally founded in the 1940s to oppose the House Un-American Activities Committee and government blacklisting during the McCarthy era. In a public letter, the members state their goal is to defend constitutional rights against what they describe as a new, coordinated campaign by the federal government to silence critics.

          <p>Small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. are beginning to explore the use of stablecoins as a way to circumvent high credit card transaction fees, which totaled a record $187.2 billion in 2024. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, offer the potential for faster and cheaper payment processing. Companies are now testing new apps that allow customers to pay with stablecoins directly at the register. This trend is gaining momentum following recent stablecoin legislation, signaling wider mainstream adoption of the technology. (not investment advice)</p>
