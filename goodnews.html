          <p>Chelsea advanced to the Club World Cup semi-finals with a 2-1 victory over Brazilian team Palmeiras. A highlight of the match was a spectacular goal from 18-year-old Estevao Willian, a future Chelsea player who was playing his final game for Palmeiras. Despite his impressive performance against his future club, a late own goal by Palmeiras sealed the win for Chelsea. Chelsea's manager and players expressed excitement about Estevao's talent, anticipating his official arrival and integration into the team.</p>

          <p>The Hamas organization has publicly stated it issued a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt. The group expressed its readiness to engage in negotiations to implement the framework, which reportedly includes a two-month truce. U.S. President Trump reacted with optimism to the development, suggesting a deal could be reached soon. However, reports indicate Hamas is still seeking firm guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the proposed truce.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, which is expected to sideline him for about six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise with no structural damage. The team's management expressed confidence that Muncy will return well before the playoffs. In the interim, the Dodgers will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base rather than pursuing a high-cost replacement on the trade market.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Far Rockaway area of Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. City officials utilized drone technology to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety, reopening the beaches after about an hour. The incidents occurred just days after New York's governor reassured the public about enhanced shark surveillance measures being in place for the holiday weekend. Authorities continue to monitor the waters to keep beachgoers safe.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases its focus on China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, competitors like South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to expand their roles. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged support to reclaim its status as a global leader. Policy guidelines aim to bolster the sector by promoting the development of advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels. This strategic shift is occurring as global trade dynamics and geopolitical tensions reshape the maritime industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed tax and spending package does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this provides some tax relief but is not a full repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just their Social Security payments, and will not benefit low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in mitigating climate change through a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists calculate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. This discovery highlights the critical, yet overlooked, role these organisms play in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

His involvement, which he claims was instrumental in securing the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, highlights the unconventional methods being used in the high-stakes effort to secure a permanent ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the UK. The chick is one of ten that hatched at the zoo this year as part of a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species. Zookeepers distributed the eggs among different nests to improve the chances of survival, entrusting one to the first-time foster parents. Same-sex penguin pairings have been observed before, with both parents sharing incubation and feeding duties to care for their young.</p>
