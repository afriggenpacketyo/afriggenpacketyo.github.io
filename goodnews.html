          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced a surprising sales success with its new "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras. The palm-sized cameras, which come in blind box packaging and feature vintage-style filters, sold out quickly on Kodak's website, tapping into Gen Z's appetite for nostalgic technology. This positive consumer response provides a bright spot for the company, which has been facing significant financial struggles, including a recent warning about its ability to continue operations. The product's popularity suggests a savvy move to capitalize on current market trends.</p>

          <p>The search for a new Federal Reserve chair is actively underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting several potential candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is also reportedly pushing a reform agenda for the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and shrink its massive bond portfolio in a non-disruptive manner. The process is occurring under close White House scrutiny, as President Trump has been advocating for an interest rate cut. The new chair will replace Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.</p>

The court found him guilty of leading a conspiracy that culminated in his supporters storming government buildings in January 2023. The 70-year-old right-wing populist was found guilty on five charges, including attempting to violently overthrow the democratic order. Bolsonaro now faces the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence, which is expected to be announced on Friday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California bill aiming to ban "forever chemicals," or PFAS, from cookware and other consumer products has created a contentious debate. Environmental advocates, including actor Mark Ruffalo, support the ban due to the documented health risks associated with PFAS exposure, such as cancer and liver damage. Opposing the bill is a coalition of cookware manufacturers and celebrity chefs like Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller, who argue that the nonstick coatings are safe when used correctly and that alternatives are less effective. The legislation reflects a growing national movement to limit exposure to these persistent chemicals.</p>

          <p>The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is launching its largest-ever single-film exhibition to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster, "Jaws." The exhibit features over 200 artifacts, including original props, storyboards, and interactive displays that allow visitors to step into the filmmaking process. At the launch event, Spielberg reminisced about the notoriously difficult production, which he once feared would end his career. The exhibit celebrates the film that defined the summer blockbuster and became a cultural phenomenon.</p>

          <h2>Belarus Releases 52 Political Prisoners in Deal to Ease US Sanctions</h2>

          <p>The authoritarian government of Belarus has released 52 political prisoners, including journalists and activists, as part of an agreement with the United States. In exchange, the U.S. will lift some sanctions on the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, allowing it to purchase aircraft parts. The release was described by leader Alexander Lukashenko as a humanitarian gesture ahead of joint military drills with Russia. While this is a positive development for those freed, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners still remain incarcerated in the country.</p>

          <p>NATO members are deploying additional troops, artillery, and air defense systems to the alliance's eastern flank in response to a Russian drone incursion over Poland. The Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and France are among the nations sending military support after Polish jets shot down several Russian drones that crossed into its airspace. Polish officials described the incident as an unprecedented provocation and have requested a UN Security Council meeting. The move represents a concrete reinforcement of NATO's commitment to protecting its members against Russian aggression.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Benefits May See Higher Cost-of-Living Adjustment in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 14:46:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on recent inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would increase the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54, providing some relief against rising prices. The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated. While this projected increase is higher than the 2.5% adjustment for 2025, it is significantly lower than the record-high COLAs seen during the peak inflation years of 2022 and 2023.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the financial structure of the recent U.S.-Japan tariff agreement, which includes a $550 billion investment from Tokyo into American infrastructure projects. Under the deal, the U.S. and Japan will initially split profits from these projects 50/50 until Japan's initial investment is recouped. Afterward, the profit share will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The arrangement aims to boost domestic manufacturing in sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics while providing Japan with lower tariff rates on its goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The race for the deputy leadership of the UK's Labour Party is now a two-person contest between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. The only other candidate, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, failed to secure enough nominations from fellow MPs to proceed. The contest was initiated after the resignation of Angela Rayner. The winner, who will be chosen by a ballot of party members in October, will serve as a key link between the party's grassroots and its leadership but will not hold the title of deputy prime minister.</p>
