          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Action Against Iran's Nuclear Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 11:34:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from *The Atlantic* argues that Donald Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites represent a decisive action against a dangerous nuclear program. The author contends that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a significant threat to Israel and the broader region, potentially triggering nuclear conflict. Trump's approach is characterized as a precise, limited use of force with the threat of further action if Iran retaliates. The author suggests that Iran is a weaker state than many perceive, with vulnerabilities in its air defenses, security apparatus, and economy, and that the strikes have significantly set back Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Gulf markets showed limited reaction. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain gained modestly. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped isolate it from the conflict, minimizing short-term market impact. The market may be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat.</p>
