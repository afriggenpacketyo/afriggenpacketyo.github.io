          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform X faced a brief outage, leaving tens of thousands of users unable to access the site. The analytics platform Downdetector reported that approximately 25,000 users experienced issues, with the problems largely resolved by 10 a.m. ET, though intermittent issues persisted until around 11 a.m. This is the second outage in less than a week for the platform, prompting Musk to acknowledge the need for "major operational improvements." Musk stated that failover redundancy should have worked but did not, and he plans to dedicate more time to addressing the company's critical technologies. </p>

          <p>A major power outage struck southeastern France, impacting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival and prompting a police investigation into possible arson. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department after a high-voltage line fell, following a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes. Power was restored hours before the closing ceremony, allowing scheduled events to proceed as planned. Traffic lights were non-functional, causing traffic jams, and many shops remained closed, though the festival confirmed that the Palais des Festivals had switched to an independent power supply. </p>

          <p>In Santiago, Chile, autumn provides excellent hiking weather in the steep hills above the city, including Cerro San Cristobal. The trail leads past old stone walls, wildflowers, and peppercorn trees, offering shade and scenic views. Despite the sun, fog often fills the valley, creating a unique perspective of the city's towers and hills floating on clouds. The summit features a statue of the Virgin Mary and side paths that open to views of the city and the snow-capped Andes mountains. </p>
