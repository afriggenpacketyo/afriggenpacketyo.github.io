          <p>The race to deploy driverless taxis is intensifying, with Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla competing for market share. Waymo is expanding its service areas in Los Angeles and San Francisco, while Zoox is opening a new production facility with the capacity to produce 10,000 robotaxis per year. Tesla is also testing driverless Teslas in Austin, Texas, with plans to launch a commercial service. Experts predict that self-driving technology could have a transformative impact on society, but challenges remain, including weather conditions, charging infrastructure, and safety concerns. The industry's future hinges on successful testing and development. This article reflects optimism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, arguing that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully attempting to coerce them into adhering to Trump's immigration policies. The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. This ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to pressure sanctuary jurisdictions. This reflects ongoing political and legal battles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with a decrease of up to 47% in plastic bag litter collected during coastal cleanups. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, and partial bans were the least effective. California's experience with plastic bag regulations serves as an example of how policy design impacts waste reduction. The findings support the implementation of stricter plastic bag laws to protect marine life. This shows progress.</p>

          <p>This review of "28 Years Later" describes the film as half-genius and half-monster, praising its ambition and quirky characters but noting its tonal inconsistencies. The film picks up nearly three decades into a viral pandemic, focusing on a community in Lindisfarne. The review highlights the film's use of flashbacks, historical allusions, and a mix of violence and philosophy. The movie is a mixed bag.</p>
