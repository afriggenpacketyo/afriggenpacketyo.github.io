          <p>Week 3 of the NFL season delivered unexpected outcomes, with several teams, including the Cleveland Browns, Carolina Panthers, and Chicago Bears, securing their first victories. The Indianapolis Colts, led by Daniel Jones, maintained their undefeated status with a dominant win over the Tennessee Titans. Meanwhile, the San Francisco 49ers also remained unbeaten after a narrow victory against the Arizona Cardinals. These results defied early-season expectations, with other notable games seeing the Buffalo Bills defeat the Miami Dolphins and the Minnesota Vikings dominating the Cincinnati Bengals. The week underscored the unpredictable nature of the NFL season, reshuffling early standings and showcasing both established and emerging talent.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, defying expectations of a cut despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate reduction. This decision aligns with economists' predictions that Beijing would hold off on major stimulus amid a recent stock market rally, even as economic data signals fatigue. Retail sales and industrial output growth slowed in August, and consumer prices fell, indicating sluggish domestic demand. Policymakers are expected to implement marginal monetary easing later this year to meet the annual growth target of around 5%, with a focus shifting from risk management to reflating the economy.

          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), with visible folding hinges on its wings, appears to be adapted for potential deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This design modification, hinting at a naval variant possibly designated GJ-21, was also suggested by images on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, informally known as a "drone carrier." These clues suggest the GJ-11 could be the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, positioning it for crucial roles in intelligent warfare. The development signifies a significant advancement in the People's Liberation Army's uncrewed systems capabilities.</p>

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index saw a slight decline, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose significantly, and South Korea's Kospi also added gains. U.S. equity futures remained stable after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at fresh all-time highs, reflecting market optimism about further Fed rate cuts.

Dave Gilmore, a DJ, crafted a playlist featuring songs like Guns and Roses' "November Rain" and Hazel O'Connor's "Will You?" to soundtrack his own experience. Experts highlight music's neurological and emotional impact, as it "lights up" multiple brain regions, offering comfort even when unconscious. Charities like Marie Curie recognize music's role in creating shared experiences and reducing anxiety for patients and their loved ones, providing solace and preserving memories during difficult times.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that children with exceptional social skills often have parents who consistently implement nine key practices early in their lives. These parents prioritize open communication about emotions, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and sometimes fail. They also teach conflict resolution, validate their children's feelings, and help them recognize social cues. Furthermore, these parents avoid immediately solving every conflict for their children, treat mistakes as learning opportunities, and listen more than they lecture. Such an approach builds emotional safety and resilience, preparing children for healthy real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has declared that welfare reform "must happen" to address the rising cost of benefits and ensure people receive necessary support. Despite the government's recent U-turn on proposed cuts to disability and health-related benefits, McFadden insists reform is ongoing. The plan involves offering skills and employment support to 3.7 million working-age individuals currently on health-related benefits who have no job-seeking requirements. McFadden did not rule out tightening eligibility for universal credit, emphasizing that the current system is "unhealthy" and contributes to the growing benefits bill by failing to help people return to work.</p>

          <p>Scientists on Nantucket are pioneering a novel approach to reduce Lyme disease transmission by genetically engineering wild mice to be immune to the bacteria. This project, "Mice Against Ticks," aims to interrupt the infection cycle, as mice are the primary hosts for Lyme bacteria. Using CRISPR technology, researchers are inserting an antibody gene into mouse embryos, creating heritable immunity. The plan involves releasing thousands of these engineered mice, but first requires community buy-in and small-scale field trials to assess ecological impacts. This ambitious project seeks to address a significant public health issue while carefully considering the ethical implications of altering natural ecosystems.</p>
