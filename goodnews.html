          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including U.S. miner Albemarle, surged after Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) suspended production at its Yichun Project mine in China. The mine, which accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025, halted operations after its permit expired. The suspension tightens an already constrained global market, with investors anticipating higher lithium prices due to the reduced supply. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production upon approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to over $119,000, approaching its all-time high, while Ether surged to its highest level since December 2021. This cryptocurrency market upswing has been largely attributed to increased buying during Asian trading hours, fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. Analysts suggest that the growing national debt acts as a tailwind for hard assets like Bitcoin and gold, pushing prices higher. The rally also boosted crypto-related stocks, with companies like Coinbase and Galaxy Digital seeing significant gains as investor sentiment remains bullish. (not investment advice)</p>

The ESPN app will be an all-in-one service including live sports from its TV networks, while Fox One will stream content from its broadcast and pay-TV networks without original content.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 12:05:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, bowling alleys, and expanded bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which has drawn thousands of new visitors and spurred activity in the remaining retail stores. This strategy focuses on creating community hubs and experiential destinations, which in turn drives 'cross-shopping' to the traditional retailers that remain. Data suggests this trend is increasing mall traffic, as consumers visit for reasons beyond shopping, such as events, dining, and entertainment.</p>

          <p>Cannabis industry stocks experienced a significant rally after reports that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less-dangerous drug category. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III would ease tax burdens and encourage institutional investment. Trump confirmed he is looking at the issue and will make a determination in the coming weeks, sparking optimism in the market. While the final decision rests with the Attorney General and DEA, analysts believe reclassification would be a game-changer for the approximately $80 billion industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for TKO Group's UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. Starting in 2026, all UFC events, including marquee fights and 'Fight Nights,' will stream in the U.S. on Paramount+, with select events simulcast on CBS. This deal marks a shift away from the pay-per-view model, as Paramount will not charge additional fees for access to the events. TKO leadership stated the move modernizes their distribution, while Paramount's new CEO called UFC a 'unicorn asset' that strengthens their live sports offerings.</p>

This initiative, part of the 'Universal EV Program,' will begin with a midsize electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch with a starting price around $30,000. CEO Jim Farley stated the move is a radical approach to compete with global competitors, particularly from China. The new vehicles will utilize lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries assembled in the U.S., a key detail as the industry navigates changing EV policies.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service in late September, marking the end of an era for the technology that introduced millions to the online world. The characteristic sounds of a modem connecting became a familiar soundtrack in the 1990s and early 2000s, when AOL peaked with over 23 million subscribers in the U.S. The service became largely obsolete with the introduction of faster broadband internet. While only a small fraction of U.S. households still use dial-up, the shutdown signifies a nostalgic farewell to a foundational piece of internet history.</p>

Companies like Perplexity already have deals with PayPal for such services, and reports suggest OpenAI is planning a similar system with partners like Shopify.

          <p>Experts are advising on the best placement for savings, comparing certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). HYSAs are recommended for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are suggested for those aiming to maximize interest returns and lock in current high rates, as they provide a fixed return for a set term. With interest rates on savings products expected to fall, CDs can protect against future rate drops, though they come with early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

The artist, known for exploring his Chicano and LGBTQ+ identities, has gained prominence in the local art scene, with work featured at the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art and Culture.

          <p>Psychologists and pediatricians are increasingly advocating for a simple but powerful technology rule for children: no screens in the bedroom, ever. This guidance is aimed at protecting sleep, as screens at night are known to delay bedtime and worsen sleep quality, which can negatively impact mental health and academic performance. Experts also suggest this rule helps 'future-proof' children by teaching them a healthier relationship with technology. Using devices in communal areas makes online activity less private, encourages better decision-making, and can foster family conversations about the digital world, counteracting technology's isolating nature.</p>
