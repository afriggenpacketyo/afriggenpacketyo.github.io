          <p>President Trump's policies are impacting domestic political battles worldwide, although not always in his favor. In recent elections in Canada and Australia, parties that emulated Trump's style were defeated, while centrists gained ground.

However, in Germany, the impact has been less direct, but still felt, as Friedrich Merz was able to push through spending limit suspensions due to concerns about American commitment to mutual defense.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, some experts caution against relying on the procedure, citing its high cost and lack of guarantees. Critics argue that egg freezing sends the wrong message to young women, creating a false sense of security. Stories like Evelyn Gosnell's, where 30 frozen eggs did not result in a viable embryo, highlight the risks. There are also concerns about the increasing emphasis on profits in the fertility industry.</p>
