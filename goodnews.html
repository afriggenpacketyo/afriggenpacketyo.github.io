          <p>Charlie Mackesy, author of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," revealed his new book, "Always Remember," took six years to complete partly because his iPad containing many ideas and drawings was stolen from his car. The theft, which occurred when the device hadn't backed up, forced him to reconstruct significant portions from memory. This article also details Mackesy's personal struggles during the book's creation, including the loss of his mother and beloved dog, Barney, the inspiration for the Mole character. Despite these setbacks and immense success, he emphasizes the importance of connection and giving back, such as planting 2,000 trees.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged past $4,000 an ounce, reaching a record high as investors seek safe haven assets amidst global economic and political uncertainty. This rally, the biggest since the 1970s, is attributed to factors like US President Donald Trump's tariffs, delays in economic data due to the US government shutdown, and a weakening US dollar. Analysts suggest gold's value may continue an upward trend for at least five years, but caution that prices could fall if interest rates rise or geopolitical tensions ease. The article notes this surge reflects expectations of lower interest rates, making gold more attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Zealand's central bank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), has unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points to 2.5%, the lowest since July 2022. This larger-than-expected reduction aims to stimulate economic growth amid concerns over weak activity and moderating domestic inflationary pressures. The RBNZ projects inflation to return to its 2% target by mid-2026, despite a more significant contraction in GDP than anticipated. This article highlights the bank's proactive measure to support recovery in consumption, acknowledging global economic policy uncertainty but noting improved growth forecasts for key trading partners like China.

          <p>Sky-watchers across the globe were recently treated to a dazzling supermoon, which appeared exceptionally brighter and larger in the evening sky. This celestial event occurs when the moon reaches its perigee in orbit, signifying its closest point to the Earth. This particular supermoon holds special significance, being known by multiple names, including the "Hunter's Moon." This name harks back to historic preparations for winter in the northern hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats. The article highlights the visual spectacle and the rich cultural context associated with this impressive astronomical phenomenon.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on the last day of a three-week off-grid hike with his wife and dogs in Montana's grizzly bear country. His wife, Laura O'Neill, discovered the news through a flurry of text messages after his phone was finally taken off airplane mode. Dr. Ramsdell, who initially disbelieved the announcement, shared the prestigious prize with two other scientists for their groundbreaking research into how the immune system attacks hostile infections. This article highlights the humorous and unusual circumstances of his notification, contrasting his remote experience with the global recognition of his significant scientific achievement, which took 20 hours for the Nobel Assembly to confirm.</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has been photographed closely approaching Mars, marking only the third such confirmed object to enter our solar system. Images captured by two Mars orbiters show the faint comet moving against distant stars, approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars. Scientists describe this as a challenging observation due to the comet's extreme faintness. This article notes that the comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, remaining visible through September before reappearing in December, offering valuable data for analysis.</p>

          <p>Indonesia, encouraged by China's successful role in building Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway on Java, is now seeking further Chinese investment for expanding its travel network, including a 60km urban subway in Bali. The China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) is already involved in the US$20 million Bali Urban Subway project, with the first line expected to open in 2031. While the existing Jakarta-Bandung high-speed line has seen millions of passengers and no operational hitches, the article implicitly raises questions about potential debt implications for Indonesia, as indicated by the headline's "What about debt?"

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to unveil a new economic "golden rule" aimed at cutting government borrowing and taxes. The plan commits a future Conservative government to allocate half of all savings to reducing the deficit and the other half to economic growth policies, including tax cuts. Badenoch will accuse the Labour government of risking financial stability with a "borrowing and tax doom loop," seeking to reclaim the mantle of fiscal prudence. This article highlights the party's pledges to save £47bn annually through cuts to welfare, civil service, and foreign aid, while also making new spending commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delivery firm DPD has announced that drivers who had chosen not to work due to a pay dispute will return to their assignments, stating that "an agreement on a way forward has been reached." The three-day action stemmed from DPD's plan to cut the amount paid for small parcel deliveries by 65p for its predominantly self-employed or franchised drivers. Drivers reported that these changes would significantly reduce their annual income, making household costs difficult to manage, despite DPD's claims of increased rates for larger parcels and new incentive payments. This article suggests the dispute has been resolved, preventing further disruption to the company's services.</p>
