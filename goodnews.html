          <h2>Mortgage Demand Surges Despite Economic Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Despite lingering economic uncertainty, weekly mortgage demand has surged by 11% due to slightly lower interest rates. Applications for home purchases increased, driven by conventional loans, indicating that move-up buyers are still active. Refinance applications also rose, particularly for Veterans Affairs (VA) loans. The market's slow April performance, influenced by tariff concerns and stock market volatility, contrasts with the recent surge in demand, and the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could further impact mortgage rates.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge following the announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025 as competition from copycat compounded drugs diminishes. The pharmaceutical company had reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales for Wegovy, leading to a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast. However, the end of an FDA drug shortage ruling is expected to curb the availability of compounded alternatives. Novo Nordisk is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to enhance access to Wegovy.</p>

          <p>Mikel Arteta, Arsenal's manager, attributes the team's lack of trophies in recent seasons to timing, emphasizing the importance of being in the right place at the right time. Despite finishing second in the Premier League for the past two seasons, Arsenal has not secured major silverware since 2020. Arteta highlights that Liverpool won this season's title with fewer points than Arsenal accumulated in previous campaigns. He expresses hope that Arsenal will capitalize on their Champions League opportunity and reach the final.</p>

The Rail Safety and Standards Board affirms that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers, and the government anticipates new jobs and apprenticeships will be available as early as December.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots that contributes to drought resistance, potentially enabling the transformation of widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. The researchers identified a gene called HMGB1, which obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice, allowing it to thrive in water-scarce environments. This breakthrough could enhance food security in regions facing water scarcity.</p>
