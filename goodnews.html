          <p>Engineering students at Johns Hopkins University have innovated a specialized printer capable of adding Braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. This invention, requested by Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), addresses the challenge of accommodating plastic beer labels, which commercial Braille printers cannot typically handle. The students designed the machine with open hardware and integrated software, making it user-friendly for employees with low or no vision. This initiative supports BISM, the largest employer of blind and low-vision workers in Maryland, and benefits Checkerspot Brewing Company's annual fundraiser for vision loss.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, fulfilled a lifelong dream of meeting penguins, 70 years after being denied a research trip to Antarctica solely because she was a woman. While working for the U.S. government in Argentina in the 1950s, Garcia was fully prepared for the expedition but was turned away at the last moment due to her gender. The Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance, in collaboration with Compassionate Hospice, arranged a special behind-the-scenes encounter with African penguins, bringing immense joy to Garcia and her family. This heartwarming event highlighted a past injustice while celebrating a dream realized in her later years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Communication experts emphasize that an apology offers a critical opportunity for leaders to foster positive change and build trust, particularly after missteps. Effective apologies require taking full responsibility, demonstrating understanding of what went wrong, and outlining a clear path forward to prevent recurrence. Timing is paramount, as waiting too long can signal indifference, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Genuine empathy and a human touch are crucial, as disingenuous or emotionless statements can undermine trust and harm company morale. Leaders should prioritize transparency and a concrete action plan to reassure stakeholders.</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to draw renowned Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig away from traditional theatrical releases by offering highly lucrative contracts, extensive creative freedom, and access to over 300 million subscribers.

The streaming giant has become a haven for ambitious projects with large budgets or risky genres that traditional studios might reject. This strategy has proven successful, with Netflix consistently securing Oscar nominations and seeing its stock value soar.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents bereavement leave for miscarriages occurring before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This significant change extends current provisions, which only apply to losses after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the move aims to provide grieving parents with necessary time off work. The proposed leave would be unpaid for at least one week, with further details on eligibility and requirements to be determined through consultation. This legislative update is hailed as a crucial step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement.</p>

The Dodgers, inspired by her work for a new clubhouse wall, sought her blessing and prominently displayed her name. This move contrasts with LAX's ongoing reluctance to officially acknowledge her, bringing long-overdue recognition to a pioneering female artist.</p>
