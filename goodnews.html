          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced in a recent interview that he has found a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase TikTok, the popular video-sharing app. This development comes as the app's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to sell its US operations due to a law passed over national security concerns. Trump, who previously supported the ban but now favors the app's use, expressed confidence that the Chinese government would approve the sale. The identity of the potential buyer remains undisclosed, with Trump stating he would reveal more details in the coming weeks.</p>

The sales coincide with the stock reaching new highs, up over 17% this year. CEO Jensen Huang recently sold about $15 million in shares as part of a pre-disclosed plan to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of the year. Despite the significant insider selling, the company's stock hit a fresh record last week, briefly regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tijuana's Kenia Enr√≠quez, an interim world champion in two weight classes, has signed an exclusive contract with the mixed martial arts organization Combate Global. The move stems from her frustration with the World Boxing Council (WBC), which she accuses of delaying a unification bout against the current champion, Gabriela Fundora. Enr√≠quez, who has held an interim title since 2017, feels she has been disrespected and denied the opportunities she has earned in the ring. Her transition to MMA represents a significant career shift, driven by a search for the respect and opportunities she feels are lacking in professional boxing.</p>

The New Shepard rocket lifted off from West Texas, carrying its capsule to an altitude of 65 miles, just beyond the internationally recognized boundary of space. The passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly in space, experienced several minutes of weightlessness and viewed the Earth through the capsule's large windows. The entire sub-orbital journey lasted about 10 minutes, concluding with a safe parachute-assisted landing for the capsule and a powered vertical landing for the reusable booster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With temperatures rising, animal welfare experts are reminding dog owners of the serious dangers of exercising their pets in hot weather. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer from heat-related illness during exercise than from being left in a car, as they can only regulate their temperature through panting and their paw pads. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, excessive drooling, and lethargy. To keep dogs safe, owners are advised to walk them only in the very early morning or late evening, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water and indoor playtime on the hottest days.</p>

According to the Golf Handicap Information Network, Trump maintains a 2.8 handicap, which is considered the lowest of any U.S. president in history and is exceptionally impressive for a golfer of any age. The 79-year-old has been an avid player for years, with legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus once remarking that Trump loves the sport "more than he loves money." His frequent play has evidently kept his game sharp, as reflected by his low official handicap.</p>
