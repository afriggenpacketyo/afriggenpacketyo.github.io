          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:13:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates reach their lowest point in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically to capitalize on the favorable conditions. Experts emphasize the importance of timing, noting that lenders often adjust rates in anticipation of Federal Reserve decisions, meaning waiting could be a missed opportunity. Securing a low rate is also heavily dependent on maintaining a high credit score, which remains a crucial factor for lenders. Additionally, buyers are encouraged to prioritize finding their ideal home over waiting for even lower rates and to obtain pre-approval to strengthen their offers in a competitive market.

          <p>Veteran character actor Clifton Powell has publicly identified Jeff Witjas as the agent who he claims fired him for accepting a role in the 2005 film "The Gospel." Powell stated that the agent condescendingly referred to the project as "another one of those little Black movies," prompting a defiant response from the actor. Despite the incident, Powell's career has flourished, and he credits his success to staying connected with his core audience, a strategy advised by Jamie Foxx. The actor, known for roles in "Ray" and "Rush Hour," continues to work prolifically without compromising his principles.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, successfully weighed in at the same weight as super-middleweight champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez ahead of their highly anticipated fight in Las Vegas. Crawford, aiming to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three divisions, appeared in exceptional physical condition. The bout will see Alvarez defend his four major world titles at the Allegiant Stadium. While Alvarez's experience and natural power at this weight could be decisive, many experts are tipping the adaptable Crawford to make history in this significant showdown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is organizing its third annual trip for American agricultural exporters to China this fall, aiming to foster dialogue with officials and participate in a major import expo in Shanghai. This year's visit carries increased importance as both nations work to stabilize relations while trade tensions persist, which have led to reduced Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products. The delegation will include about 20 state representatives, agricultural associations, and exporters, who will showcase their products in a dedicated American pavilion. The mission seeks to reinforce trade ties in a critical overseas market for American farmers.</p>

          <p>Savers with a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) maturing this September face a complex decision amid a climate of falling interest rates. While current CD rates are lower than a year ago, renewing is still presented as a viable option for several reasons. Savers can still lock in competitive rates, around 4.50%, which protect funds from the variable rates of savings accounts and will earn substantial interest over time. With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting rates, renewing a CD now could be one of the last opportunities to secure a relatively high, fixed return for an extended period.

          <p>Brazil's supreme court has sentenced former president Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for orchestrating a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 election results and stage a coup. The conviction, along with those of seven high-ranking military and security allies, is being celebrated as a significant victory for Brazilian democracy and a challenge to the country's history of impunity. While Bolsonaro's supporters may see him as a martyr, a majority of Brazilians believe he was involved in the plot.

          <p>The new film "Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale" provides a satisfying conclusion to the beloved series by focusing on the small-scale social and familial dramas that have long defined it. Set in 1930, the story explores contemporary themes through a historical lens, such as the scandal surrounding Lady Mary's divorce and the generational struggle over managing the estate. The article praises the script by Julian Fellowes for its blend of nostalgia and relevance, as well as a standout performance by Arty Froushan as playwright Noël Coward. While not breaking new ground, the film serves as a pleasurable final visit with the iconic characters.</p>

          <p>A new inquest has opened into the death of Steve Biko, the iconic South African anti-apartheid activist who died in police custody 48 years ago from a brain injury. Biko's son, Nkosinathi Biko, expressed confidence that the proceedings will finally lead to the prosecution of those responsible, stating that accountability for the country's violent past is essential for its democracy. Although former officers admitted to assaulting Biko during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, none were ever prosecuted. The case, held on the anniversary of Biko's death, represents a renewed push for justice for apartheid-era crimes.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearings on explicit music lyrics, a debate spearheaded by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), co-founded by Tipper Gore. Musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Frank Zappa, and John Denver testified against the proposed warning labels, arguing they amounted to censorship. The PMRC, however, framed the initiative as "truth in packaging" to help parents make informed choices. The hearings ultimately led to a deal with the recording industry to place the now-iconic "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers on certain albums, a voluntary practice that continues today.</p>

          <p>Following the successful public debut of their company Gemini, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have made a bold prediction that the price of a single bitcoin will reach $1 million within the next ten years. They argue that the cryptocurrency is still in its early stages and functions as "gold 2.0," a superior store of value that will continue to disrupt traditional assets. The twins believe there is still significant room for growth, suggesting at least a tenfold increase from its current price. Their forecast reflects their long-held bullish stance on bitcoin, which has seen its value increase over 30,000% since they founded their exchange. (not investment advice)</p>
