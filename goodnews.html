The agreement will make discounted drugs available on a new government website, TrumpRx.gov, with the administration seeking similar deals with other pharmaceutical companies.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a new national ambition for two-thirds of young people to enter university, further education, or a "gold standard apprenticeship" by age 25. This marks a significant policy shift away from the longstanding goal set by Tony Blair in 1999 to have 50% of young people attend university. The new target aims to give greater prominence to vocational and technical training, a move welcomed by industry groups and college associations as a way to better align education with job market needs.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has launched a fleet of autonomous delivery robots, called "Dots," in the Phoenix metropolitan area. These five-foot-tall bots can travel up to 20 miles per hour and carry up to 30 pounds, navigating sidewalks, bike lanes, and roads to deliver smaller orders. The company's AI-powered platform determines which deliveries are best suited for a robot versus a human Dasher, aiming to create a more efficient system for local commerce. This initiative positions Phoenix at the forefront of automated delivery technology.</p>

          <p>Arianna Huffington is advocating for a cultural shift away from the belief that overwork leads to success, calling it a "collective delusion." She recounts her own experience collapsing from exhaustion and burnout in 2007, which served as a wake-up call to change her life and challenge the prevailing work culture. Now, as CEO of Thrive Global, she emphasizes that scientific data shows people are more effective and creative when they prioritize rest and well-being, urging individuals to adopt "micro steps" to build healthier habits.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," examines the cultural significance of the all-female touring music festival from the late 1990s. Co-founded by Sarah McLachlan, Lilith Fair was created in response to an industry that marginalized female artists, refusing to play their songs back-to-back on the radio. The documentary highlights how the festival provided a rare sense of community, safety, and empowerment for both the performers and the audience, challenging industry norms and demonstrating the commercial and cultural power of women in music.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, savers can still strategically use certificates of deposit (CDs) to earn significant returns, such as $1,000 or more. The article outlines several scenarios, including depositing $24,000 into a one-year CD or a smaller amount into a longer-term CD to achieve this goal. With further rate cuts anticipated, financial experts suggest that now is an opportune time to lock in current high rates before they decline further, potentially using a CD laddering strategy to maintain flexibility.
