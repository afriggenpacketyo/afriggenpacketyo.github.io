Braekhus will face Ema Kozin in Lillestrom for the WBC and WBO light-middleweight titles in her final fight. She holds three Guinness World Records and is proud of bringing boxing back to Norway. Braekhus expresses excitement for the future of women's boxing and has no regrets as she transitions to life outside the ring.</p>

          <p>Recent incidents of abusive crowd behavior at the Ryder Cup have sparked a debate about whether accepted codes of conduct have changed. A survey indicates a significant percentage of live event workers in the UK have experienced antisocial behavior from audience members. Experts attribute this to factors like deindividuation and convergence, while others argue that concerns about degraded manners are overblown. Some suggest that swift action against disruptive individuals can shape crowd behavior and maintain a balance between passion and civility. A social psychologist notes that music event organizers have reported deteriorating audience behavior since the Covid pandemic.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Acceptance of Hamas's Peace Plan Response Creates Pressure on Netanyahu</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 23:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has accepted Hamas's response to his 20-point peace plan for Gaza, even though it falls short of unequivocal acceptance. Trump is demanding that Israel immediately stop bombing Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages. This move puts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a difficult position, as he views the Hamas response as a rejection of the plan. Trump's decision is influenced by his desire to further the Abraham Accords, win the Nobel Peace Prize, and address rising unfavorable views of Israel's Gaza policy. The Israeli attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar was a turning point for Trump.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces rallied late to defeat the Phoenix Mercury in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, winning 89-86. Dana Evans scored 21 points off the bench, while A'ja Wilson also had 21 points and 10 rebounds. The Mercury had a lead for much of the game, but a technical foul shifted the momentum to Las Vegas. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed player unrest regarding pay and officiating before the game. The game was preceded by tension off the court, with the league's collective bargaining agreement set to expire at the end of October.</p>

          <p>Retained firefighters, on-call emergency responders in rural areas, are still awaiting their pensions despite decades of service. Many were not entitled to a pension until recent years, and some retirees are still waiting for clear indication of when they might receive their money. The Fire Brigades Union fought for retained firefighters' pensions, leading to settlements allowing claims dating back to 2000. However, delays in employment tribunals continue to present an obstacle to members receiving what they are owed in a timely manner. The West Yorkshire Pension Fund is working to process the complex cases.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein signed "Iryna's Law," increasing checks on criminals out on bail and prohibiting cashless bail for violent crimes and repeat offenders. The law is in response to the stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte light-rail train. The suspect, Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., had a history of arrests and was recently released on a misdemeanor charge. While Stein doesn't fully support the bill, he signed it because it alerts the judiciary to consider violence risks before determining bail. The law also faces criticism for its focus on bail ability rather than the threat posed, and for a last-minute amendment regarding executions.</p>

Newsom threatened to cut state funding to any California university that agrees to the compact, which covers admissions, diversity, and free speech. USC's interim President said the offer is important to study and discuss, consulting with various stakeholders. Newsom expressed confidence in the UC system's ability to maintain its values without compromising academic freedom.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering minting new one-dollar coins for the nation's 250th anniversary featuring an image of President Donald Trump. The proposed coin features Trump's face on one side and a portrait depicting him pumping his fist after his 2014 near assassination on the other. The Treasury might be able to mint the coin due to a law signed by Trump at the end of his first term. There are provisions that could prevent Trump from appearing on currency, though it’s not clear if it would apply in the case of the commemorative $1 coin. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers at FinalSpark in Switzerland are creating neurons developed into clusters called organoids, which can be attached to electrodes. These 'wetware' systems replicate aspects of how AI learns and could use less energy than current methods. While the concept may seem strange, scientists hope to trigger learning in the biocomputer's neurons so they can perform tasks. FinalSpark's organoids can now survive for up to four months, and scientists have observed flurries of activity before their demise.</p>
