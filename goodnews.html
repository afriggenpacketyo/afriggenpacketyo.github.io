          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains, mirroring a rally in the U.S. where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were lifted by technology stocks. The positive movement came despite broader economic fears and followed a U.S. court ruling on tariffs that pushed the 30-year Treasury yield above 5%. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all recorded increases in early trading, continuing the focus on global bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The artwork, once part of Dutch-Jewish collector Jacques Goudstikker's collection, was discovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing connected to the daughter of a former Nazi lawyer. The painting is reported to be in good condition, and the individuals who possessed it have been placed under house arrest pending a hearing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard University was illegal. Judge Allison Burroughs described the action as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault," stating that the administration used concerns about antisemitism as a pretext to retaliate against the university for not complying with demands that violated First Amendment rights. The ruling vacates the funding freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis and Lou Gehrig's disease.</p>

          <p>The UK's defense secretary stated that allied nations are prepared to support Ukraine both before any potential peace negotiations and in securing a future peace agreement. Speaking in Kyiv, he emphasized a commitment to help make Ukraine's skies, seas, and land safe once a deal is reached, contrasting with defiant remarks from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The comments come ahead of a meeting in Paris of the "Coalition of the Willing," a group of allies reportedly ready to provide long-term security guarantees to Ukraine, including the potential deployment of European troops to deter future aggression.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, including Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr, must significantly increase sales in the coming months to reach their goals of breaking even by 2025. While second-quarter losses have narrowed for these companies due to discount-driven sales, they are still operating in a highly competitive market marked by a persistent price war. Nio's CEO stated the company needs to double its current sales to 50,000 vehicles per month in the fourth quarter to stay on track, highlighting the immense pressure on these start-ups to achieve financial stability.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not legally constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," the conditions required to invoke the centuries-old wartime statute. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of rapidly removing certain migrants without standard immigration proceedings, although the government can still seek to remove them under other legal authorities.</p>

This initiative highlights the challenge some Chinese officials face in trying to boost consumption while adhering to national leadership's emphasis on curbing extravagance as part of an anti-corruption campaign.</p>

Under the negotiated agreement, these voters will now be able to provide the required information using a provisional ballot at the polling place, a solution championed by the Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups.</p>
