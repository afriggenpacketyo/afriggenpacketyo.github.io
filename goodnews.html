          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang delivered the keynote speech at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as ‚ÄúSummer Davos,‚Äù in Tianjin, amidst a tense global atmosphere. China's economy has largely withstood the tariff war initiated by the U.S., but it continues to face external challenges, including strained relations with the European Union and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. Beijing aims to bolster its domestic market and secure its position in global supply chains to address these challenges. Recent measures include efforts to attract foreign businesses and investors, along with a new law designed to stimulate entrepreneurship and economic growth within the country.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park and raided the food store, consuming a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park ensured that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The experienced keeping team successfully used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the escape, attributed to an operational error, and to implement measures preventing future incidents.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports progress in the adoption of electric cars and heat pumps, though further increases are needed to meet climate goals. The committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through reduced energy bills. While electric car sales are growing rapidly, heat pump adoption remains below target, despite government grants. The CCC also suggests making electricity cheaper by removing charges related to renewable energy projects from household bills.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, providing new insights into the Milky Way's evolution. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study presents direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London is displaying a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, for the first time since 2014. Originally misclassified as Nanosaurus, the labrador-sized dinosaur lived 150 million years ago alongside giants like Stegosaurus. Scientists concluded it was a new species based on unique features in its leg bones, which suggest it was a fast runner, and the discovery helps fill gaps in knowledge about the evolution of smaller dinosaurs.</p>
