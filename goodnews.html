          <p>The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have initiated a public inquiry into the live music industry's business practices, following an executive order from President Trump to combat ticket scalpers. The inquiry aims to address unfair and anti-competitive conduct, particularly regarding high resale ticket prices and the dominance of concert giants like Live Nation. The public has two months to submit comments about their experiences in the live music market. This announcement comes almost a year after the DOJ and 40 states announced an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, accusing the company of acting as a monopoly.</p>
