          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Friday, not following the positive trend set by Wall Street, as investors processed regional economic data. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix both saw declines after Tokyo's core consumer price index for August rose at a slower pace, though it remained above the central bank's 2% target. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq indices both registered gains. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also saw a slight increase, contributing to the varied performance across the region's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the DNA of an 800-year-old tree known as the Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire to understand its remarkable resilience to disease, climate change, and other environmental stressors. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify specific genes that contribute to the long life and durability of ancient oaks. Scientists hope this genetic information can be used to select the most robust trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of the UK's woodlands. Ancient oaks are vital ecological cornerstones, supporting over 2,300 species of wildlife.</p>

Since its inception in 1947, WDIA has served as a vital cultural and informational hub for the Black community, broadcasting news ignored by mainstream outlets and championing civil rights causes. Johnson, known to her listeners as "your girlfriend," continues this legacy by providing critical information and a platform for community leaders. The station played a key role in the preservation of the Lorraine Motel, now the National Civil Rights Museum.</p>

          <p>Venus Williams, aged 45, achieved her first women's doubles victory at the US Open since 2014, partnering with 22-year-old Leylah Fernandez. The pair defeated the sixth-seeded duo of Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez in straight sets, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Williams, a 14-time major doubles champion with her sister Serena, expressed great satisfaction with the partnership, noting Fernandez's similar determined mentality. This win marks a significant moment in Williams' recent return to the tour after a 16-month hiatus, keeping her in the tournament after first-round losses in singles and mixed doubles.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales starting in January 2026. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost to parents. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA). The judge affirmed that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which currently lacks the members to form a quorum. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to reshape the federally funded international broadcaster, which has seen its operations drastically reduced under Lake's leadership. The judge stated that the administration's attempts to remove Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate VOA from political pressure.</p>
