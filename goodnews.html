          <p>AMD stock experienced an 11% surge on Wednesday, contributing to a remarkable 43% gain this week, making it the best weekly performance since April 2016. This rally follows OpenAI's announcement of plans to purchase billions of dollars in AI equipment from the chipmaker, potentially leading to OpenAI owning 10% of AMD. The partnership is seen as a significant boost to investor confidence in AMD's ability to compete with Nvidia in the burgeoning AI chip market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at the deal, noting OpenAI's previous close ties to Nvidia and questioning the timing of the equity exchange.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Albany, New York, have identified Joseph Nowakowski, who died in 1998, as the perpetrator in the 1964 murder of 50-year-old Catherine Blackburn. DNA evidence, preserved from the crime scene and matched through the exhumation of Nowakowski's body, linked him to the sexual assault, stabbing, and bludgeoning. Nowakowski, who was not a suspect at the time, had a history of violent crimes.

A key announcement was the plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland, which she hopes will boost home ownership and social mobility. The party also pledged to scrap business rates, axe the carbon tax on electricity, and triple police stop and search in crime hotspots. Badenoch seeks to rebuild economic credibility, presenting the Conservatives as responsible managers of public finances and a party 'fizzing with ideas'.</p>

          <p>Spaghetti Cumbia, a Los Angeles-based band, embodies a unique cultural fusion, blending their deep Mexican roots with influences from classic rock, punk rock, and hip-hop. Lead singer Marcel Campos often speaks to the feeling of being caught between two cultures, which inspired their distinctive 'Spaghetti Western' sound. Formed nine years ago, the band members, many of whom grew up amidst gang violence in East LA, credit their passion for music with saving them from a different path. Despite dreams of a 'Spaghetti Empire,' members currently balance multiple jobs to support their families in California's high cost of living.</p>

          <p>Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are significantly more cost-effective than credit cards for borrowing in October 2025, according to recent data. The average credit card interest rate stands at 22.25%, while the median HELOC rate is 7.89%, making credit cards 182% more expensive. This disparity is expected to persist even with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. HELOCs also offer potential tax benefits if used for qualifying home repair projects, further enhancing their financial advantage. Homeowners seeking substantial funding for home improvements may find HELOCs to be the superior borrowing product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting indicate that Federal Reserve officials were largely inclined to cut interest rates due to a weakening labor market. However, they were divided on the exact number of further cuts for the remainder of 2025, with a slight majority favoring two more quarter-point reductions. The discussion also touched upon the impact of Trump's tariffs, generally concluding they would not be a major source of lasting inflation. This article highlights the range of viewpoints among policymakers and the challenge of navigating monetary policy amid a government shutdown that is hindering the release of key economic data.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and anticipated further reductions, savers are advised to proactively seek good Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. While the 6% and 7% rates of previous years are gone, current short-term CDs still offer competitive rates, such as 4.10% for 3-month and 4.30% for 6-month terms. These rates remain significantly higher than traditional savings accounts, and locking them in now can protect against future declines. The article recommends exploring online banks, which typically offer higher CD rates than their brick-and-mortar counterparts. This article provides guidance for savers navigating a cooling interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>
