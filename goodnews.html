Ohio, involving a heterosexual woman who sued for discrimination after being denied a promotion in favor of a lesbian, and then demoted and replaced by a gay man.

Ames filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, believing she‚Äôd been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation.</p>

Pochettino, whose five-year stay at the club came to an end in November 2019, has been linked with a return to Tottenham. But the Argentine, who was appointed US manager in October 2024, says he is happy in his new role.</p>
