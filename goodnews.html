          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the company behind cereals like Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies, skyrocketed over 50% following reports of a potential takeover by Italian chocolate giant Ferrero. The deal, valued at approximately $3 billion, could be finalized this week and would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. This move is part of Ferrero's broader expansion strategy, having previously acquired other major food brands. The potential acquisition comes as WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles and increasing pressure to offer healthier products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, pausing to assess the effects of recent measures aimed at controlling Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged significantly, prompting authorities to address the rapid growth of household debt. Despite a slight economic contraction earlier in the year, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect potential rate cuts later in the year, but the bank remains cautious due to the substantial household debt linked to the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system.

          <p>A group of brown pelicans, poisoned by the most severe toxic algal bloom in Southern California in nearly a decade, have been successfully rehabilitated and released. The bloom, which began in January, sickened hundreds of marine animals with domoic acid, including the 13 pelicans treated at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center. The release event in Huntington Beach symbolized a moment of hope and a testament to the tireless efforts of wildlife rescuers. While this year's bloom was particularly deadly, the recovery and release of these birds offer a positive outcome amidst a challenging environmental event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the temporary head of NASA. This decision comes weeks after the president withdrew the nomination of billionaire Jared Isaacman, an entrepreneur linked to Elon Musk. In a social media post, Trump explained he felt it was inappropriate for a close friend of Musk, whose company SpaceX has major NASA contracts, to lead the agency. Duffy's appointment places another cabinet member in a dual-hatted role and comes at a critical time for NASA as it pursues ambitious goals for lunar and Martian exploration.</p>

          <p>The European Union has indicated it could finalize an outline for a trade agreement with the United States within days, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions. The move comes as President Trump continues to announce new tariff threats against numerous countries, including a 50% tariff on copper and potential levies on semiconductors. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic expressed hope for a satisfactory conclusion, taking advantage of a deadline extension to August 1. This proactive diplomacy from the EU is an attempt to find stability and avoid being drawn deeper into a trade war that has unsettled the global economy.</p>

          <p>A tentative contract agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services. The strike involved 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees, causing trash to pile up across the city. The new three-year contract includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm on the city's financial limits, and workers began returning to their jobs immediately to start the cleanup process, with full services expected to resume shortly.</p>
