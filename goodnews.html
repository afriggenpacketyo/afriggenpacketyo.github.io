        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of researchers from China and Singapore has developed a novel nanovaccine that has shown success in suppressing cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal trials. The bio-inspired approach, detailed in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, targets cancer stem cells, which are responsible for tumor growth and spread. This innovative method holds significant potential for creating personalized cancer vaccines to combat the disease more effectively. The findings represent a promising step forward in the ongoing search for advanced cancer therapies.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Utilize 'Power Law' Principle for Startup Investment Decisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capital (VC) firms often employ the 'power law' principle when selecting startups, focusing on investments with the potential for exceptionally large returns. This strategy acknowledges that a small number of highly successful companies will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, offsetting the losses from many other failed ventures. According to Peter Specht of Creandum, VCs seek 'outsized-outcome potential' and look for visionary founders who can build category-defining companies. Founders are advised to pitch ambitious, compelling stories about their market and expansion potential to attract this type of investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Major Reforms Proposed for England and Wales' Water Industry to Address Underinvestment and Sewage Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed the most significant reforms since privatization, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report makes 88 recommendations aimed at tackling long-standing issues like leaking infrastructure and sewage spills, which stem from chronic underinvestment. The proposals suggest a shift in focus towards continuous infrastructure upgrades, similar to the telecoms regulator Ofcom. While these changes aim to prevent future crises, consumers are still expected to face higher bills to fund over £100 billion in necessary upgrades.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The inquiry will examine the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had unanswered questions for over 40 years, and the inquiry aims to deliver truth and justice. Campaigners, who have long called for this investigation, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 top companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage fresh domestic investment. The meeting is part of the 'Made for Germany' initiative, which aims to restore confidence and stimulate growth after two years of recession. The German government has already approved significant tax relief and a €500 billion infrastructure fund but emphasizes that private sector participation is crucial for economic revival. The push comes as Germany, once Europe's economic engine, grapples with inflation, high energy costs, and global competition. (not investment advice)</p>
