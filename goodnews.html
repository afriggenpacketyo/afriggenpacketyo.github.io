          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to combat soaring prices. The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, addressing criticism of the government's failure to curb price spikes. Koizumi intends to bypass auctions to control prices, with potential online sales being explored. The move aims to alleviate the burden on households facing inflation outpacing wage growth, though analysts remain uncertain about its overall impact on rice prices.</p>

Businesses in Qatar are interested in using the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), via tools available in Hong Kong, including settlement, payment, hedging, and swaps. This trend reflects a broader effort by countries and businesses to diversify from the US dollar due to trade wars, aligning with China's strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence.

The Pacers' victory marked their second consecutive win at Madison Square Garden. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 36 points and 11 assists, but the team struggled with turnovers and defensive communication. The series now shifts to Indiana, where the Pacers will look to extend their lead and move closer to their first NBA finals appearance since 2000.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is preparing to take control of Lancashire County Council after winning a significant majority in local elections, securing 53 of 84 seats. The party aims to review the council's budget and address legacy issues such as special educational needs and adult social care. The new councillors, many without prior political experience, are receiving training and support from experienced officers and councillors. Priorities for Reform UK include reversing net zero initiatives and challenging diversity and inclusion policies, though some services are statutory, meaning a council has to provide them by law, and they make up a significant proportion of the council's budget.</p>

          <h2>'Sister Midnight' Review: A Stylish and Oddball Film About Urban Malaise and Female Empowerment</h2>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a gritty, rock-infused comedy about a young housewife's urban malaise in Mumbai. The film follows Uma, an arranged-marriage transplant, as she navigates a joyless existence and discovers a hidden strength through solo walks and odd encounters. Kandhari captures a liminal space in Uma's alternative existence, using stylish visuals and a punk energy. The movie eventually embraces some gnarlier elements and it is a mischievously off-the-wall exercise with a certain steam to keep up its deadpan wildness.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm struck a controversial deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The departures follow an executive order targeting Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz and taking on a pro bono case related to the January 6 Capitol riot. The order was rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, including auditing hiring practices and dedicating funds to pro bono legal services. Some law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional, and judges have struck down Trump's orders against Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade deal with the US based on "respect" following President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stressed that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect, not threats, while affirming the EU's readiness to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, with some calling for de-escalation and a negotiated solution. The EU is one of the Washington's largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.</p>

At the Wide Awake festival, √ì hAnnaidh stated authorities were "trying to silence us before Glastonbury" and urged fans to stand on the right side of history. The band's performance included a new track addressing the counter-terrorism investigation, and fans displayed Irish and Palestinian flags.
