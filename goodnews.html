          <p>Shares of Swedish fintech company Klarna, known for its buy now, pay later services, rose 15% in its New York Stock Exchange debut, closing at $45.82 after pricing its IPO above the expected range. The successful listing, which raised $1.37 billion, indicates a growing demand from Wall Street for new tech offerings this year, following strong debuts from other companies. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, emphasized the IPO as a milestone, highlighting the company's expansion into banking with debit cards and personal deposit accounts in the U.S. Despite potential regulatory headwinds in markets like the U.K., the IPO generated significant returns for long-time investors like Sequoia, though SoftBank, an earlier investor, saw its stake's value decline from a previous high valuation.

          <p>U.S. investors are demonstrating the highest level of interest in Chinese stocks in five years, with over 90% expressing willingness to increase their exposure, according to Morgan Stanley. This renewed interest, described as just "starting," extends beyond U.S.-listed Chinese equities to include the onshore market, with some funds utilizing A-share ETFs and index-future products. Factors driving this reversal include China's leadership in specific sectors like humanoid robotics and biotech, efforts to stabilize its economy and nurture the equity market, improving liquidity, and a desire for diversification from U.S. assets. Morgan Stanley anticipates more significant capital inflows as investors complete their due diligence at the individual stock level. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers completed a sweep of the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their NL West lead, despite catcher Will Smith being a late scratch due to swelling from a bone bruise in his right hand. Manager Dave Roberts expressed moderate concern, noting the need to manage the injury carefully. Mookie Betts had a stellar performance with five RBIs, including a grand slam, continuing his impressive streak. Pitcher Blake Snell contributed with six scoreless innings and 11 strikeouts, maintaining the Dodgers' rotation's dominant run. The team, while closer to full strength with other players returning, faces ongoing injury management challenges, particularly with Smith's hand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under manager David Moyes, Everton has seen a significant turnaround, avoiding relegation and moving to the new Hill Dickinson Stadium. The club recorded its highest net spend in a summer transfer window at £97 million, acquiring nine new players, which is more than their combined spending over the previous seven seasons. This financial improvement is attributed to player sales, the Friedkin Group's takeover converting debts to equity, and strategic timing of new signings to manage financial regulations. Key loan signing Jack Grealish has been impactful, and the club aims for its first trophy since 1995, with increased revenues expected from the larger new stadium.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver stated that clear evidence would be required to punish the Clippers or owner Steve Ballmer amid allegations of circumventing the salary cap through an endorsement deal for Kawhi Leonard. The league's investigation, led by a specialized law firm, centers on whether Ballmer's investment in Aspiration, a sustainability firm, was a quid pro quo for a lucrative, seemingly do-nothing endorsement for Leonard. Silver emphasized the burden of proof rests with the league, indicating reluctance to act on mere appearance of impropriety. The outcome could involve draft pick forfeitures, heavy fines, or suspensions, highlighting the NBA's commitment to protecting league integrity.</p>

          <p>Facing an industry-wide slowdown and economic pressures, luxury fashion brands are diversifying their offerings by introducing less pricey, yet still premium, products. Louis Vuitton recently launched a beauty collection, including $160 lipsticks, following similar expansions by Prada and Celine. Concurrently, extravagant bag charms, such as a $1,420 option from Louis Vuitton, are being introduced to capitalize on the 'treatonomics' trend, where consumers splurge on smaller luxuries. This strategy aims to attract a younger, broader consumer base and foster brand loyalty, while maintaining exclusivity with higher-priced core products. The long-term success of this diversification amidst current economic challenges remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) over the past five years in a strategic mineral-exploration initiative, resulting in significant discoveries of oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium. Officials announced that geologists mapped 163 mineral types and found over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, bolstering the nation's energy security and resource structure. These findings, particularly in deep basins and offshore waters, support China's stable annual oil and natural gas production. The initiative underscores China's intensified efforts to dominate critical mineral supply chains and reduce import reliance amidst growing demand from new technologies and geopolitical tensions.</p>

This meeting, lasting approximately 50 minutes, follows months of subtle clues suggesting a potential reconciliation, including a shift in Prince Harry's public tone and a reported dialogue between their communications teams. Both Buckingham Palace and Harry's team maintained a unified silence regarding the details of their conversation, emphasizing its private nature. While a full family reconciliation remains distant, this reunion is seen as a small but significant step towards healing the strained relationship between father and son.</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has discovered rocks in a dry river channel that may contain the strongest hints yet of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported. While direct detection of life is not possible for the rover, the collected samples from the Neretva Vallis mudstones show organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these compounds are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. Although non-biological processes could also be responsible, researchers consider this the most compelling candidate for long-ago life found so far, awaiting in-depth analysis on Earth, a mission currently facing cost and timeline challenges.</p>

          <p>China has opened the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, in Jiangsu province, significantly reducing travel time between Changzhou and Taizhou. Stretching 10.3 kilometers with a main span of 1,208 meters, this mega bridge is the first over the Yangtze to integrate an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway on a single structure. A distinctive feature is its asymmetrical lower deck, accommodating a 200km/h railway on one side and a regular road on the other, a pioneering side-by-side traffic layout for a large-span bridge. This engineering feat highlights China's advanced infrastructure capabilities.</p>
