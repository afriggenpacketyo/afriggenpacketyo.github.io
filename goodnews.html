          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated "the war is over" while traveling to Israel to oversee the release of hostages as part of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Speaking from Air Force One, he expressed confidence that the truce would hold and announced plans for a "board of peace" for Gaza's reconstruction. The deal involves Hamas releasing its remaining hostages in exchange for Israel freeing a significant number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Trump is also scheduled to attend an international peace summit in Egypt to formalize the end of the conflict.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, where a Gaza peace plan is expected to be signed. The summit, co-hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, marks a significant diplomatic effort to end the two-year conflict. Downing Street stated that Starmer will pay tribute to President Trump's role in brokering the deal. However, the UK's involvement has been questioned by both an Israeli minister and the U.S. ambassador, who credit the United States for the breakthrough.</p>

Speaking in a personal capacity, Yau emphasized the critical importance of cultivating domestic talent to innovate and overcome technological dependencies. He highlighted that while China has excelled in manufacturing due to a large pool of skilled labor, achieving true scientific primacy requires fostering higher-level qualifications and original research. His insights come as Beijing finalizes its 15th five-year plan, which aims to break through technological chokepoints.</p>

          <p>Talks for a potential merger between two Hollywood giants are underway after Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected an initial acquisition bid from Paramount. The offer, reportedly around $20 per share, was backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, who recently acquired a controlling stake in Paramount. A merger would significantly reshape the media landscape, potentially consolidating assets like HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. studio with Paramount's holdings, including CBS News. Despite the rejection, sources indicate that Paramount is preparing a second offer, signaling continued interest in the industry-altering deal.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signals a potential strategic realignment for the two Asian powers. During Modi's first visit to China in seven years, both leaders agreed to position their countries as "partners" rather than "rivals" and emphasized the need for "strategic autonomy" from third-party influence. This diplomatic warming, which includes the resumption of direct flights, is seen as a response to increasing hostility from the West, particularly from the U.S. under President Trump. The move represents an opportunity for India to reset its historically complex relationship with China.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team is now guaranteed to finish in at least the top two of their World Cup qualification group, securing either an automatic spot or a place in the March play-offs. Following their victory over Belarus and Denmark's win against Greece, the qualification race has become a two-team contest between Scotland and Denmark. The two nations, currently tied on points, will face off at Hampden Park next month in what could be a decisive match. Denmark holds a significant goal-difference advantage, which will be the deciding factor if the teams remain level on points after their final games.</p>

          <p>Scotland's football manager, Steve Clarke, expressed deep disappointment with his team's performance despite a 2-1 victory over Belarus that secured at least a play-off spot for the World Cup. Clarke, who became Scotland's longest-serving manager with this match, was reportedly furious with the team's lackluster play, particularly in the first half. Midfielder John McGinn described the half-time team talk as the "wildest" he had ever seen from the typically composed manager. While the result puts Scotland in a strong qualifying position, the team acknowledged that their performance level must improve for their crucial upcoming matches.</p>

The announcement adds a layer of tension to the fragile ceasefire as world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, prepare to meet in Egypt to formalize the agreement.

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein allowing Muslim students and employees to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has highlighted the country's complex system of public holidays. While a recent tabloid headline misleadingly claimed Muslims were getting "extra holidays," the regulation merely formalizes an existing practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to provisions for Catholic and Protestant observances in various states. Germany's public holidays are largely determined at the state level, creating a diverse set of rules that reflect the historical religious demographics of each region.</p>
