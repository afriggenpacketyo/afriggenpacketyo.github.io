          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:50:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring a knowledge test for individuals to qualify as accredited investors, allowing access to private market assets like venture capital and hedge funds. This initiative aims to enhance investor protection, as current accreditation relies on wealth thresholds set in the 1980s, which many experts deem insufficient given the complexity and higher risks of these investments. Designing an effective test is challenging, with concerns about assessing true financial sophistication and understanding the unique illiquidity and valuation issues of private markets. The move comes amid a broader push to make private assets more accessible, but also highlights the need for robust safeguards against potential financial losses for less knowledgeable investors.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its previous directive concerning stray dogs in Delhi, now allowing non-aggressive, non-rabid strays to be released after vaccination and sterilization, instead of being confined to shelters. The court mandated dedicated areas for feeding stray dogs and banned feeding them in public spaces, while requiring rabid or aggressive dogs to be sheltered. This modification follows widespread protests from animal welfare groups who advocated for humane solutions over mass confinement, citing concerns about overcrowding and culling. The ruling is a balanced approach to managing India's large stray dog population and high rabies-related deaths.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger opened its first Washington state location in Ridgefield, drawing hundreds of customers, with some lining up overnight and waiting hours for the popular fast food. The restaurant opened two hours early to accommodate the immense demand, fulfilling a long-held wish for many California natives residing in the state. Owner and CEO Lynsi Snyder attended the ribbon-cutting, having recently made headlines for her decision to leave California, attributing it to challenges in raising a family and doing business, though the company maintains its expansion is eastward. This opening marks a significant milestone for the chain's growth beyond its traditional Western strongholds.</p>

          <p>A recent case of the plague in South Lake Tahoe, believed to be contracted from an infected flea, has led experts to explain the disease's continued presence and current dangers. While the plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, primarily affects rodents and is rarely contracted by humans today, it remains a serious illness. Historically devastating, it is now treatable with antibiotics, though it hasn't been eradicated due to its persistence in mammalian populations spread by vectors like fleas. Public health officials emphasize that with timely treatment, there is little to fear, but awareness is crucial, especially in rural and wilderness areas where infected rodents may reside.</p>

          <p>The Wilson’s phalarope, a small migratory bird, has inspired a unique partnership between communities in California and Argentina, connected by the bird's 6,000-mile journey between saline lakes. Biologists, educators, and students from both regions collaborate on conservation efforts, fostering cultural exchange programs and events like the Phalarope Festival. These birds, crucial for their ecosystems, face threats from water use and climate change, leading to population declines and calls for their protection as a threatened species. The cross-continental bond highlights how a shared natural wonder can unite diverse groups in a common goal of environmental stewardship.</p>

          <h2>Broadway Musical 'Shucked' Delivers Delightful Country Farce to Hollywood Pantages</h2>

          <p>The musical "Shucked," now on its North American tour at the Hollywood Pantages, is a "folksy farcical riot" that brings modern "Hee Haw"-style comedy to the stage. The story, set in corn-dependent Cob County, follows Maizy as she seeks an outside "corn doctor" when the crop begins to shrivel, leading to a series of puns and charmingly off-color humor. Directed by Jack O’Brien, the production features a sunshiny score of country, blues, and Broadway pop, with standout vocal performances. Despite a slightly homogenized cast compared to Broadway, the show's warmth and intoxicating silliness provide a unique delight.</p>

          <p>David Baron's "The Martians" delves into the early 20th-century obsession with intelligent life on Mars, examining how scientists, journalists, and the public projected their fantasies onto the red planet. The book highlights key figures like Percival Lowell, who invested heavily in proving Martian canals, and Nikola Tesla, who claimed to receive signals from Mars. Baron's narrative focuses on the social currents that fueled this "Mars fever," including the theory of evolution and the rise of tabloid journalism. The article suggests that while many scientific conclusions about Mars were later debunked, this collective imagination sparked generations to consider space exploration as a real possibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>R.F. Kuang's latest novel, "Katabasis," reimagines the classic journey into the underworld as a dark academia thriller set in hell. The story follows Alice Law and Peter Murdoch, two brilliant but blinkered doctoral students, who descend into hell to retrieve their deceased mentor's soul to secure teaching positions. The article praises Kuang's intellectual depth and nuanced character development, noting a more mature and less showy tone compared to her earlier works. While rich in literary references, the novel maintains a wry humor, satirizing the self-destructive academic pursuits that lead its protagonists to choose actual hell over honest conversation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles labor groups are advocating for a "New Deal" from the city and LA28 Olympics organizing committee, seeking commitments for substantial investments in affordable housing and protections for workers and immigrants. Unions demand billions for 50,000 housing units, a ban on short-term rentals like Airbnb, and transparency in venue agreements, citing concerns that mega-events often displace low-income residents and leave host cities indebted. Olympic organizers, however, assert the Games will create good-paying jobs and positive economic impact, while Airbnb defends its role in providing lodging and generating revenue. The dispute highlights the ongoing tension between economic development and social equity in major event hosting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back government incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) and his public disdain for them, the global shift towards cheaper EVs is unlikely to be halted. While U.S. EV sales have slowed and incentives are set to expire, other countries, like China, are rapidly adopting electric and hybrid cars, backed by subsidies. Ford's recent $5 billion investment in a new EV platform for a $30,000 pickup truck signals a commitment to making affordable electric options available by 2027. This move, driven by market demand and global environmental regulations, suggests that once EVs become more cost-effective than gasoline cars, their widespread adoption will accelerate, regardless of domestic political headwinds.

Huang's visit was to thank TSMC for work on Nvidia's next-gen AI chip architecture, Rubin, and confirmed TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia. Despite this, Nvidia faces challenges with its H20 chips in China due to security concerns, leading to a reported production pause. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption surpassed 1 trillion kilowatt-hours in July, reaching a historic high due to scorching heatwaves that pushed demand to levels equivalent to ASEAN nations' annual usage. Data from China's National Energy Administration shows an 8.6% year-on-year increase, more than double the consumption a decade ago. While primary industry, including agriculture and fisheries, saw the fastest growth in electricity use, overall industrial output growth slowed slightly. This surge underscores the immense energy demands of China's economy and population, particularly during extreme weather events, and its implications for national energy policy and infrastructure.</p>
