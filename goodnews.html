          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously blocked Mexico's lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005.  This act grants broad immunity to gun companies from liability for the illegal acts of gun users, unless a knowing violation of firearm sales and marketing rules is proven.  Mexico's lawsuit, seeking $10 billion in damages and stricter gun control measures, failed to meet this exception, according to Justice Kagan's opinion. The decision marks the high court's first consideration of the gunmaker immunity law.</p>
