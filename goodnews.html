          <p>During a Senate Committee hearing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth clarified that the Trump administration does not have plans to invade Greenland. The clarification came after Representative Adam Smith questioned Hegseth about potential plans to take Panama and Greenland by force if necessary. Hegseth stated that the Pentagon has contingency plans for any number of scenarios, prompting Republican Representative Mike Turner to seek reassurance that an invasion of Greenland was not among them. Hegseth affirmed that the administration looks forward to working with Greenland to ensure its security from potential threats.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, decided to testify again in his retrial to stand up for herself and the truth, after a New York court overturned his previous conviction. She was one of three women to testify against Weinstein, accusing him of sexual assault, and the jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting her. Haley said the verdict gives her hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading. She described the cross-examination from Weinstein's attorney as deeply offensive, but emphasized that regardless of the verdict, the assault still happened from her perspective.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs Have Yet to Drive Inflation Higher Due to Several Factors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 12:02:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation, with recent data on consumer and producer prices remaining benign. Several factors are keeping inflation in check, including companies hoarding imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, the time it takes for charges to affect the economy, and a lack of pricing power due to consumer tightening. Economists believe the limited impact in May reflects pre-tariff stockpiling and a lagged pass-through of tariffs into import prices. It is expected that the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA and Axiom Space have indefinitely delayed the launch of a commercial flight to the International Space Station due to concerns about a persistent air leak in a Russian compartment. The leak, located in the Zvezda module's PrK vestibule, has prompted cosmonauts to inspect and seal areas of interest. The delay will allow NASA and Roscosmos additional time to evaluate the situation and determine if further troubleshooting is necessary. The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and the leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day. The Russians and Americans have differing opinions on the cause of the leak and the safety of continued operations.</p>

          <p>There has been an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security benefits, with claims nearly 18% higher between January and May compared to the same period last year. The Social Security Administration identified three key reasons: a peak of retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and a bump in people re-filing to claim higher benefits based on their own records. Worries about the economic future under the Trump administration are also a factor, with some fearing the government will raise the minimum retirement age. Despite President Trump's assurances, some individuals are choosing to claim benefits early, fearing they may be taken away.</p>

          <p>During chaotic times, it is common to seek safety, but Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed experimentation and risk-taking as a response to trouble. Instead of flying to safety in old routines, people should experiment with their happiness. Academic literature offers examples of behavioral interventions, such as gratitude, social interaction, mindfulness, exercise, and exposure to nature. By reconceiving life as an experimental practice, individuals can yield new ideas and habits, especially when times are rough and they need to get out of a rut, ultimately boosting their well-being.</p>

Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify these types of ads, even without nudity, and sharing signals with other tech companies.

The flag represents the in-between state of cultures and identities, and the power of transforming prejudice into strength. Amidst the protests, the Mexican flag is a bold articulation of shared struggles and a call for solidarity, despite the Trump administration's efforts to intimidate protesters and deploy military force.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to walk back the proposed "reciprocal" tariffs on goods from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico after a 90-day pause. The survey, conducted by AlixPartners, found that executives believe Trump will maintain the current 10% duty rather than implement higher rates. The anticipation stems from recent trade negotiations with China and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs. However, some caution that the optimism may be premature and that these other countries do not have the same leverage that China has to negotiate the terms of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This agreement involved transferring nine Education Dept. employees to the Treasury to discuss collections activities. However, these plans are currently on hold after a U.S. District Judge blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the Education Department.
