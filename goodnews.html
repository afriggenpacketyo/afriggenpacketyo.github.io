          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, marking a significant return to form for the team. The race was also highlighted by a team orders controversy at McLaren, where Oscar Piastri was instructed to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The order came after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a wheel gun fault, dropped him behind Piastri. While Piastri expressed initial disagreement, he complied with the team's decision, which they justified by citing a similar situation in a previous race.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren-like sound as part of the second national test of the government's emergency alert system. The alert, which included a message clarifying it was a drill, sounded for approximately 10 seconds and was intended to ensure the system's readiness for genuine national emergencies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the test an important step in public safety, noting that it successfully reached tens of millions of devices. The system has previously been used for real warnings, including for severe storms and the discovery of a WWII bomb.</p>

Speaking on ABC News, Massie argued for transparency regardless of the social status of those implicated. Democratic Representative Ro Khanna added that there is sufficient support in the House to force a vote on a discharge petition to release the files, predicting that the necessary 218 signatures will be secured by the end of September.

The driver, clad in a full racing suit and helmet, was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried vehicle was seen again on the D4 motorway. Because the driver's helmet had previously prevented identification, police were unable to press charges. The vehicle is believed to be a Dallara GP2 car, and the owner now faces fines for driving an unregistered and unequipped vehicle on a public road.</p>

Barrett refrained from commenting on specific pending legal issues, such as presidential power, emphasizing the judicial process requires thorough review.</p>

The research, which looked at data spanning from the 1930s to the 1990s, examined nine disorders including anxiety, depression, and ADHD. The phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," remained consistent across different cultures and generations. Researchers theorize that individuals with similar mental health challenges may be drawn to each other due to shared understanding, similar environments, or even the stigma that can limit dating prospects.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is the most critical step parents can take to foster their child's long-term health and success. Good sleep is fundamental for a baby's physical, cognitive, and emotional development, laying the groundwork for learning, concentration, and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb, getting non-breastfeeding partners involved in settling, and maintaining a flexible routine. He emphasizes that teaching a baby to sleep well is a foundational skill that benefits them for a lifetime.</p>

The piece suggests that solar energy aligns with conservative ideals of hyper-individualism and self-reliance.

While China added a record amount of solar capacity, issues like grid capacity and intermittency have led to increased "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. In this context, coal plants act as a reliable backup, ensuring grid stability during peak demand and giving operators the confidence to integrate unprecedented levels of wind and solar power.
