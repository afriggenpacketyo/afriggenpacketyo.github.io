          <p>A year after CEO Brian Niccol took over, Starbucks is seeing a mixed response to his turnaround strategy aimed at reviving the "third place" coffeehouse experience. While some initiatives like the "Green Apron Service" program have shown promise and improved sales in test locations, the company still faces shrinking traffic and same-store sales. Investors and some employees remain skeptical, as changes like reintroducing handwritten messages on cups have been criticized and the company's stock has fallen 7% during Niccol's tenure.</p>

Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham after a difficult league season but a historic Europa League victory, is seen as a strong candidate, with his appointment potentially coming before the team's next match against Arsenal.</p>

Now back on the court, Brink is focused on her basketball career while also seeking meaningful ways to advocate for mental health and support marginalized groups, redefining the role of a high-profile athlete.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has expanded access to "copper plans" on the Obamacare exchanges, making most Americans eligible for these lower-premium healthcare options. Previously, these plans, which offer full coverage but have higher out-of-pocket costs, were restricted mainly to individuals under 30. This policy change is presented as a way to make health insurance more affordable for working families and encourage uninsured individuals, particularly healthier young people, to get coverage, potentially stabilizing the insurance market.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling stopped short of breaking up Google, a decision that may have been influenced by the rapid emergence of generative AI. The judge in the landmark antitrust case, which found Google illegally monopolized the search market, noted that AI chatbots have fundamentally changed the competitive landscape in just a few months. While Google still faces penalties like sharing information with rivals, the ruling suggests the threat of AI-powered search disrupting traditional search engines was a key factor in avoiding more drastic measures.</p>
