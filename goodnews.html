          <p>The BBC has revealed several new celebrity participants for the 23rd season of its popular competition show, 'Strictly Come Dancing.' The lineup so far includes 'Love Island' winner Dani Dyer, actress Alex Kingston, and former professional footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, with more names expected to be announced soon. The article also notes the addition of two new professional dancers to the cast. This season follows a period of controversy for the show, which prompted the BBC to implement new welfare measures for all participants and crew members involved in the production.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, suspending the implementation of new, higher tariffs for an additional 90 days until November 10. This move provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the U.S. terms unfair trade practices. Under the extended agreement, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain at 30%, while China's tariffs on American products will stay at 10%. Despite averting an immediate escalation, the extension prolongs uncertainty for businesses, as trade flows between the two economic giants have already seen a significant decline this year.

Now 37, Lewandowski also discussed his role as a veteran player mentoring younger talents like Lamine Yamal and credited former manager Jürgen Klopp as having a life-changing, father-like influence on him during their time together at Dortmund.</p>

According to Chinese state media, Xi emphasized that the two nations should work together to set an example of solidarity and self-reliance for the Global South, signaling a strategic alignment amid global economic tensions.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore has stated the company will "be ready" for its next casino license renewal in 2026, after its current license was renewed for only two years instead of the usual three. The shorter term was issued by Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance. Despite the rebuke, the company is proceeding with a S$6.8 billion expansion, focusing on experiences over shopping. New attractions include Minion Land at Universal Studios and the Singapore Oceanarium, with a Super Nintendo World and a new luxury hotel complex planned for the coming years.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to pursue a new startup venture. His departure comes as GitHub faces a surge of competition in the AI-powered coding assistant market from fast-growing rivals like Cursor and Replit. Dohmke, who oversaw the launch of the popular GitHub Copilot, will stay on through the end of the year to manage the transition. GitHub will continue to operate within Microsoft's CoreAI division, with top executives now reporting to a different leader within the new structure.</p>

          <p>Amid fierce competition in China's instant retail market, a prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to support the sector's growth. He argued that "quick commerce," which involves delivering goods within 30 minutes, presents new consumption opportunities crucial for the country's long-term economic health. Rather than stifling competition, Wang urged officials to implement targeted policies that steer the industry away from excessive cash burn and towards innovation and quality improvements. The goal is to foster a more sustainable and high-quality industrial ecosystem for this burgeoning market.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate tourism in its more remote areas, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. This initiative is aimed at drawing attention to unexplored destinations in the country's less-developed western provinces. The move contrasts with a recent fee increase for climbing Mount Everest, which continues to be a major source of revenue but also faces issues of overcrowding. It remains unclear if infrastructure improvements will accompany the fee waiver to support a potential influx of climbers to these remote regions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four people in connection with a series of burglaries that targeted several residences, including the Los Feliz home of actor Brad Pitt. The break-in at Pitt's home occurred in June while the actor was out of the country, with suspects scaling a fence and smashing a window to gain entry. According to law enforcement sources, the thieves stole some items after ransacking the property. The arrests were made in South Los Angeles as part of a broader investigation into burglaries across the city, some of which involved celebrity homes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy already convicted by a jury for using excessive force. The judge called the government's effort to overturn the conviction "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy to begin his four-month prison sentence. The unusual post-trial attempt to unravel the case was initiated by the new U.S. Attorney, a Trump appointee, and had previously led to the resignation of several prosecutors who objected to the move.</p>
