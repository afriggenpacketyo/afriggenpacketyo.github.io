          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER) is showcasing fusion energy technology at the World Exposition in Osaka, marking its first independent participation in the event. ITER's exhibits explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being constructed in France, with Japan highlighting its significant contributions to the project. Fusion energy, generated by merging light atomic nuclei, is viewed as a clean and byproduct-free energy source, though its practical realization is still decades away. The project involves collaboration between China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union, aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion energy.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Public Favors Regulation of Election Social Media</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media platforms during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises from growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, highlighting the tension between freedom of expression and the need for accurate information. While Japan has enacted a law to facilitate the removal of defamatory content, its impact has been limited. The survey also reveals divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Rolando 'Rolly' Romero upset Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match held in Times Square, marking the biggest win of his career. Romero dropped Garcia in the second round and controlled the fight, earning him the WBA's secondary welterweight title. Garcia, returning from a suspension, struggled with timing and output, landing few punches throughout the bout. The loss jeopardizes Garcia's potential rematch with Devin Haney. The event, held in partnership with Ring Magazine and funded by Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, was the first major boxing card in Times Square.</p>

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of "nepo babies," children of celebrities who often find quick entry into industries like film, fashion, and music, using Blue Ivy Carter's performance on Beyonc√©'s Cowboy Carter tour as a case study. While some argue that these children benefit from unearned spotlight due to their parents' fame, others acknowledge their talent and hard work. The piece examines various perspectives on the advantages and challenges faced by nepo babies, including the pressure to live up to expectations and the struggle to establish their own identity. It also touches on the broader debate about meritocracy and the role of privilege in career success.</p>

          <p>China has passed a new law to bolster its private economy, set to take effect on May 20, which aims to provide legal recourse for private firms. Observers are closely monitoring how the Private Economy Promotion Law will impact the ability of firms to challenge local governments in court and protect themselves from arbitrary fines. The law includes provisions to curb administrative powers, potentially enabling entrepreneurs to litigate against local governments more effectively. It also forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous fine collections and asset seizures.</p>

Carney announced the visit in his first news conference since the federal election, emphasizing that it "clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country," which is a nod to Trump's remarks about making Canada the 51st US state. The King's visit is scheduled to coincide with Carney's upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump, amid frayed ties between the two countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients that Trump dislikes. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The order had suspended security clearances for the firm's employees and barred its attorneys from government buildings.</p>
