          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing due process concerns under the Alien Enemies Act. In New Jersey, a transit strike by locomotive engineers shut down the rail network, impacting commuters traveling to and from New York City. The strike, the first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, stemmed from failed contract negotiations regarding wage parity. The article also notes that Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met for their first direct peace talks since the war began, agreeing to a prisoner swap of 1,000 individuals each.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and temporarily halted flights at Midway International Airport. The dust storm also impacted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois, coating the area in debris. The National Weather Service noted that dust storm warnings are more common in rural parts of central and southern Illinois.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, including standing ovations, investment pledges, and national honors.

Trump's visit contrasted sharply with the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethical questions. He praised the wealth and efficiency of his hosts, highlighting deals underway between American and Emirati companies.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Hannah Dugan, pleaded not guilty to federal charges for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, echoing a similar case in Massachusetts involving Judge Shelley Joseph. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape through a back door of her courtroom to avoid an ICE agent. While Dugan was quickly charged, Joseph's case took over a year, highlighting the rarity of such prosecutions and raising questions about federal overreach and the balance between state and federal authority.</p>

The research team, led by professor Zhang Shifeng, has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1, featuring lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins. The guided munition operates on principles similar to hypersonic glide missiles but travels at a slower pace. The Tianxing-1 is launched from ground-based platforms and transitions into a glide phase to engage targets autonomously.</p>
