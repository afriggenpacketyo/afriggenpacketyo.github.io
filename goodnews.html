          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark. The technology could potentially be used in surgical procedures, encryption, or rescue operations, though critics note that existing night vision devices are more powerful and easier to use.</p>
