        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a tactical analysis of England's recent Test match victory over India, highlighting the pivotal role of fast bowler Josh Tongue. It explains that Tongue's aggressive and intimidating bowling style was instrumental in quickly dismissing India's lower-order batsmen, a traditional weakness for England. The author, a former player, uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the psychological pressure effective tail-end bowling creates. The piece argues that this ability to 'kill the tail' is a vital, often-underestimated skill that will be imperative for England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new voter outreach program called "Organizing Summer" to regain momentum following losses in the 2024 elections. With an initial six-figure investment, the effort aims to mobilize thousands of volunteers to connect with voters in non-traditional settings and provide direct feedback to inform party strategy. The initiative will focus on key 2025 and 2026 races, seeking to counter the Republican agenda and rebuild the party's brand after recent internal disputes. The program represents a strategic shift to strengthen the party's grassroots presence in states across the country.</p>

          <p>The WNBA has announced a major expansion, adding three new franchises in Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029), and Philadelphia (2030), which will bring the league to 18 teams. This move follows the previously announced additions of Toronto and Portland for the 2026 season. All three new teams are backed by NBA ownership groups and come with a $250 million expansion fee, reflecting the surging demand and investment in women's professional basketball. The expansion leverages existing basketball infrastructure and aims to create new regional rivalries, capitalizing on the league's growing momentum in viewership and attendance.</p>

          <p>A key provision within the massive Republican budget package would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for service workers like waiters and bartenders. The White House has promoted the proposal as a major tax cut for the working class, but the plan has drawn criticism for its limitations. The tax break would be temporary, expiring in 2028, and versions of the bill include income caps for eligibility. Policy analysts note that over a third of tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income tax anyway, meaning the benefit would not reach the lowest earners while primarily helping middle and some high earners.</p>

The new measures will include more frequent and sophisticated facial verification checks to ensure that only legally registered account holders are using the platforms.

President Trump had labeled the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened retaliatory tariffs, putting critical trade talks on hold.
