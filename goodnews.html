          <p>The White House has announced plans for a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long desired. Funded by Trump and private donors, construction is set to begin in September and will replace the current East Wing offices. The new venue will seat approximately 650 guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity, eliminating the need for temporary tents for large state functions. The administration states the design will be architecturally consistent with the White House and completed well before the end of the presidential term.</p>

          <p>Apple reported third-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a 13% year-over-year growth in iPhone sales. The company's overall revenue increased by 10%, marking its most significant quarterly growth since December 2021, causing shares to rise in after-hours trading. While Mac sales also saw strong growth, iPad and wearables revenue declined, representing tougher spots in the report. The company noted that U.S. tariffs could impact future costs, but strong performance, particularly in China, helped bolster the positive results (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient hybridization event. Scientists found that the modern potato inherited a crucial gene from the ancient tomato that enables the formation of its starchy tubers. This gene, combined with another from a wild potato species, was necessary to create the potato as it is known today. The discovery solves a long-standing puzzle about the origin of the popular vegetable and demonstrates how interbreeding between species can lead to new traits.</p>
