          <p>Candy manufacturer Mars has announced a partnership with biotechnology company Pairwise to use CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop more sustainable and resilient cocoa plants. The collaboration aims to create cacao varieties that can better withstand diseases, heat, and other climate-related pressures that threaten the global chocolate supply. This move reflects a growing trend in the food industry to leverage biotechnology for supply chain security, similar to Starbucks' investment in climate-resilient coffee farms. The partnership will utilize Pairwise's Fulcrum platform to accelerate the development of desired crop traits more precisely than traditional breeding methods.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic pledge to $600 billion. The announcement, celebrated by the Trump administration, is seen as a move to avoid threatened tariffs that would impact Apple's international supply chain. The investment aims to bring more component production and advanced manufacturing to the United States. This comes as President Trump has been pressuring the company to shift production from countries like China and India, recently imposing higher tariffs on Indian goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump has hailed "great progress" following a meeting between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The talks, described by the Kremlin as "constructive," focused on ending the war in Ukraine ahead of a U.S.-imposed deadline for a ceasefire. While details remain sparse, both sides exchanged unspecified "signals," with Trump stating that European allies have been updated and agree the war must end. This diplomatic effort comes as the U.S. simultaneously approved additional military sales to Ukraine and imposed new tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil.</p>

          <p>An elite team of Honolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards patrols the treacherous seven-mile stretch of Oahu's North Shore, home to the world-famous Banzai Pipeline. These lifeguards face some of the most dangerous surf conditions globally, where a single wave's energy could reportedly power the city of Honolulu for a week. With Hawaii having the second-highest drowning rate in the U.S., this team's skill is critical, and they perform thousands of rescues each year, often using jet skis to reach victims in perilous waves. Veterans of the force describe the work as highly rewarding but also a constant duty they feel even when off the clock.</p>

          <p>Four critically endangered Barbary lion cubs have made their public debut at a zoo in the Czech Republic. The birth of the three females and one male is a significant step for an international program aimed at preserving the subspecies, which went extinct in the wild in the 1960s. The cubs will eventually be sent to other parks to ensure genetic diversity for the captive population, which numbers fewer than 200. Zoo officials are in preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities about a long-term plan to potentially reintroduce the majestic lions to their native habitat in the Atlas Mountains.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a destructive fire that ravaged the community of Altadena, one resident has started a free plant stand to help her neighbors regrow their lost gardens and find solace. Laurie Scott, who lost part of her own property, began propagating plants and offering them to anyone affected by the fire, aiming to bring a sense of hope and life back to the area. The "Regrow Altadena" initiative has since distributed over 1,000 plants and seed packets, with support from other residents, local businesses, and master gardeners.

          <p>The Italian government has given its final approval for a €13.5 billion project to construct the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily with the mainland region of Calabria. The 3.3-kilometer bridge is designed to withstand major earthquakes, a key concern for the seismically active region. Proponents, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, champion the project as a major investment that will create jobs and boost the economies of two of Europe's poorest regions. However, the plan faces significant opposition over costs, environmental impact, and fears of mafia infiltration, with legal challenges from local groups potentially causing further delays.</p>

          <p>Alternative rock band Rainbow Kitten Surprise has announced their new album, "Bones," will be released on September 26. The 10-track collection is described as a rawer, more direct follow-up to their previous work, with frontwoman Ela Melo calling it a "spill-your-guts-out record." Many of the songs were written quickly and feature lyrics that touch on relationships, substance use, and the singer's own journey with sobriety. The band aimed for a sound that could be easily replicated in their energetic live shows, moving away from the more layered, synth-heavy production of past albums.</p>
