        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom experienced a slight slowdown in wage growth over the summer, with average earnings increasing by 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% in July. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate marginally rose from 4.7% to 4.8%, primarily driven by younger individuals entering the job market. Job vacancies also continued their downward trend for the 39th consecutive period, signaling a stabilization in the UK's labor market after a year of considerable volatility. Economists suggest this easing in wage growth could eventually pave the way for the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates.</p>

          <p>Australia has initiated a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign, "For The Good Of," to promote its upcoming world-first ban on social media for teenagers under 16, effective December 10. The campaign aims to raise awareness and encourage parents to discuss the new law with their children, citing research that indicates social media overuse harms young teens through misinformation, bullying, and negative body image. While the government asserts the ban is for children's well-being, social media platforms like YouTube have expressed concerns about enforcement difficulties and hinted at potential legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is campaigning for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after losing both his parents to heart conditions. He believes that if he had known CPR, he might have been able to save his father, emphasizing that panicking in a crisis significantly reduces survival chances. Having already persuaded his own school to adopt the training, Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign highlights that quick intervention with CPR can drastically improve the one-in-ten survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. His efforts have garnered attention from MSPs and the Education Secretary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The England national football team is grappling with a notable shortage of out-and-out striker options beyond captain Harry Kane, a concern highlighted after Ollie Watkins' recent injury. Remarkably, only seven English players classified as traditional strikers have featured in the Premier League this season, with just one under the age of 26. Under-21s manager Lee Carsley has also expressed the need for more orthodox number nines capable of scoring goals. As England approaches World Cup qualification, the search for a reliable deputy for Kane becomes a critical selection challenge for manager Thomas Tuchel.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is strongly advocating for the urgent introduction of a targeted screening program for prostate cancer in the UK, particularly for men aged 45-69 with a family history of the disease and Black men who face double the risk. A report by Prostate Cancer Research, for which Sunak is an ambassador, estimates the program would cost £25 million annually and involve MRI scans, PSA tests, and biopsies. While some medical experts express caution about potential overtreatment and side effects, Sunak argues that advancements in MRI technology now make such a program both deliverable and affordable, promising to save countless lives.</p>

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) are collaborating on this campaign, hoping to replicate the success seen with the organ donor register prompt on license applications. The NHS currently faces a "challenging" blood shortage, requiring 5,000 donations daily and a critical need for 200,000 new donors, especially for O negative blood, to maintain a safe and reliable supply for hospitals.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, largely thanks to Blake Snell's exceptional pitching performance. Snell delivered eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out ten batters, in one of the greatest individual postseason starts in Dodgers history. The game also featured a confounding fourth-inning double-play that nearly cost the Dodgers runs due to a lack of awareness, but Freddie Freeman's crucial home run and a late save from Blake Treinen ultimately sealed the win. This triumph showcased the Dodgers' ability to overcome on-field adversity with dominant talent.</p>
