          <p>Elon Musk is set to leave his position as a 'special government employee' in the Trump administration, with his departure commencing Wednesday night. Musk thanked President Trump on X, stating that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team will continue its work throughout the government. Due to his role as a special government employee, Musk was limited to a 130-day appointment, which he is nearing. Despite leaving his official role, Musk will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president and may attend White House meetings, but senior White House officials expressed frustration with Musk's comments regarding Trump's agenda and policy.</p>

          <p>Following the approval of flag football as an Olympic sport in 2028, former NFL center Jason Kelce proposed a competition between NFL players and established flag football players to determine who represents Team USA. Kelce expressed confidence that NFL players would outperform current flag football players, while flag football national team quarterback Darrell Doucette III insists that flag football players should not be overlooked. Travis Kelce questioned Doucette's willingness to compete against NFL players, suggesting a tryout to select the best players. The debate highlights the tension between established flag football athletes and the potential influx of NFL talent into the sport.</p>

          <p>One of the Big Bear eaglets, Sunny, was observed hovering for the first time, marking a significant milestone before fledging. Hovering involves the eaglet catching the wind to lift its body off the ground without fully leaving the nest, differing from fledging, which is when the eaglets permanently leave the nest. Sunny and its sibling Gizmo, who are about 3 feet tall with a wingspan of over 5 feet, are expected to fledge soon. The parents, Jackie and Shadow, will continue to support the eaglets after they fledge, teaching them how to find food and protecting them as they mature.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams won a libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy, Denis Donaldson. The High Court in Dublin awarded Adams damages of 100,000 euros ($113,000) after the jury found the BBC had defamed him in a 2016 Spotlight documentary. Adams has consistently denied being a member of the IRA and stated the BBC's journalism was not fair, responsible, or in the public interest. The BBC expressed disappointment with the verdict, defending its editorial processes and journalistic diligence.</p>

Despite Dimon's frequent warnings about potential economic calamities, JPMorgan has achieved record profits under his leadership. Some observers suggest Dimon's pessimism is a strategic move to keep his team focused and prevent complacency. Others believe that bankers are generally more cautious in their public statements to avoid reputational damage.
