          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. Despite the merger with OneWeb, experts express doubt about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale, citing its much smaller satellite constellation and reliance on U.S. launch services. While the investment signals a strategic push for Europe's technological sovereignty, analysts believe Eutelsat is better positioned to serve niche sovereign and enterprise markets rather than compete directly in the mass-market broadband segment.

          <p>Located just miles from mainland China but governed by Taipei, Quemoy Island serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transitioned into a quiet community that reveals the constraints on both Beijing's and Taipei's influence. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance model, the island's current state shows a complex reality where it is caught between two competing political systems. This demonstrates the practical difficulties each side faces in asserting complete control.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new nationwide ban on smoking in public spaces, including all beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries, which officially went into effect on Sunday. The rules are aimed at protecting the public, particularly children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke and are part of a broader government initiative to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, though there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants.</p>

          <p>A massive spending and policy package championed by President Trump, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate late Saturday night. The 51-49 vote followed hours of intense negotiations, with several Republican holdouts ultimately agreeing to advance the legislation after securing concessions. The passage was a significant victory for Senate Republican leadership, who aim to get the bill to the president's desk by July 4. However, the bill still faces a final vote and potential opposition in the House. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Hard, dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain solar energy, releasing it slowly and elevating temperatures, especially at night. The lack of vegetation and water, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the effect. With climate change making heatwaves more frequent and intense, the growing populations of urban centers are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and its associated health risks.</p>

The city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, supported the march, framing it as a celebration of freedom and human rights.
