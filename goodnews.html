          <p>Japan has initiated mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis screening for foreign nationals planning to stay longer than three months, beginning with citizens from the Philippines and Nepal. This measure aims to address the rising number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, predominantly from six specific countries. Individuals will need to provide proof of TB-free status before entering Japan or face denial of entry. While TB is preventable and curable, it remains a significant global health concern, prompting Japan to take proactive steps to maintain its low-incidence status.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced a 10-year industrial strategy that includes measures to lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aims to cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms starting in 2027. Additionally, energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges, and plans are in place to expedite energy grid connections for new factories. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized that the strategy intends to stabilize the UK economy and mitigate challenges from abroad, particularly regarding energy prices.</p>

Bradley's most recent Ryder Cup appearance was in 2014, and he was named captain this time after Tiger Woods declined the opportunity.</p>

          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child while installing pipes, adding to the city's rich archaeological heritage. The mummy, believed to be from the pre-Inca Chancay culture, was found in a sitting position with associated artifacts, including ceramics and gourds. Peru requires utility companies to hire archaeologists during drilling due to the high probability of encountering heritage sites. This discovery underscores the abundance of archaeological remains along the Peruvian coast, particularly in Lima, which is home to numerous ancient cemeteries.</p>

The author questions the value of a humanities education in the face of AI, suggesting its true aim is the formation of human persons rather than the creation of products. The author proposes adding friction back into the learning process by encouraging students to reflect on their use of AI and its impact on their thinking. The author suggests that educators must help students cultivate practical wisdom to navigate the complex choices presented by emerging technologies.</p>
