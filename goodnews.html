          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations detailing President Trump's "no tax on tips" policy, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The guidance clarifies which occupations are eligible and specifies that workers in fields like healthcare, legal, and financial services do not qualify. Additionally, the rules state that automatic gratuities, such as fixed service charges for large parties, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary. The tax break is set to apply from 2025 through 2028 and phases out for individuals with higher incomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call to finalize an agreement aimed at preventing a ban on TikTok in the United States. The discussion follows the establishment of a deal "framework" earlier in the week, addressing U.S. concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump, who has previously extended deadlines for the divestment, expressed a desire to keep the popular social media platform operational in the U.S., citing its "tremendous value." The outcome of the call is pivotal for the future of TikTok's American business operations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 08:50:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to high tariffs from the ongoing trade war, retailers are adopting a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce costs without raising prices for consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party middleman, which purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, effectively cutting the duty cost. Companies like Yours Clothing and Tod's Group have successfully used this method to halve their tariff expenses. While some analysts praise this as a creative adaptation, others warn it may be a short-term solution that masks deeper supply chain issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major credit card companies are increasing the annual fees for their premium travel cards, with the American Express Platinum card now costing $895 and the Chase Sapphire Reserve at $795. To justify the higher costs, these companies are bundling more benefits, primarily in the form of statement credits for specific vendors like Lululemon and StubHub. Financial experts advise consumers to carefully analyze their personal spending habits and travel patterns to determine if the value of the perks, such as airport lounge access and credits, outweighs the steep annual fee before committing to or renewing these cards.

Savin, who fled Russia after condemning the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, re-established his club in Cyprus, creating a team that unites immigrants from various post-Soviet countries. Despite facing charges in absentia in Russia for "discrediting" the army, Savin has invested his own money to build the club into a competitive force. The club serves as a symbol of unity for its diverse, Russian-speaking fan base and represents a new beginning for its exiled president.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released from detention in Afghanistan after being held by the Taliban for over seven months without charge. The couple, who had lived and worked on education projects in the country for 18 years, were arrested in February. Their family and UN human rights experts had expressed grave concerns about their deteriorating health while in custody. Following their release, which was facilitated with help from Qatar, the couple expressed their gratitude and relief as they prepared to be reunited with their family.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series went on sale globally, drawing long lines in major cities from Beijing to London and showing strong initial demand. The launch is a critical test for Apple as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Early sales data from Chinese e-commerce platforms suggests robust preorder volumes, surpassing last year's models. The successful rollout could also help reassure investors who have questioned the company's progress and strategy in the field of artificial intelligence, an area where competitors are perceived to be advancing rapidly.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy named Stephen has become one of the youngest known stem cell donors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to save his father, Nick Mondek, who is battling acute myeloid leukemia. After a previous transplant from his brother failed and no other matches were found, Mondek's only hope was his young son, who was a partial genetic match. Stephen bravely agreed to the procedure, which was more complex due to his age, stating he just wanted to help his dad. The donation offers the potential for Mondek's body to build a new, stronger immune system to fight the cancer.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are advising consumers on the best strategies to pay down debt. Key recommendations include creating a strict budget to identify extra cash, negotiating lower interest rates with credit card companies, and making more than the minimum payment on all loans. For those with high-interest credit card debt, a balance transfer to a 0% APR card could be beneficial if the debt can be paid off during the introductory period. Experts stress that understanding the emotional spending habits that lead to debt is the first step toward achieving financial wellness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Caution on Refinancing Loans Despite Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year may eventually lower borrowing costs, financial experts advise consumers to be patient before refinancing loans like mortgages and auto loans. Reductions in consumer rates typically lag behind the Fed's actions, and a single cut may not be substantial enough to make refinancing worthwhile. A general rule of thumb is to consider refinancing only when there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between your current rate and a new one. Homeowners should also be wary of refinancing too frequently, as closing costs can erode any potential savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book review critiques the prevalent narratives of AI-driven apocalypse and utopia, arguing that both perspectives are based on misguided and exaggerated beliefs about artificial intelligence. The author contends that figures warning of an AI uprising and tech leaders promising a technological paradise are two sides of the same coin, both distracting from more immediate and realistic concerns about AI's deployment. The article criticizes the fundamental premise of a measurable, singular "superintelligence," suggesting that both doomsayers and accelerationists are projecting capitalist ambitions and human biases onto a technology they fundamentally misunderstand.</p>
