          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, initially feared lost at sea, was successfully rescued after spending a night alone on an uninhabited island. The teenager, Darcy Deefholts, had gone surfing off the coast of Wooli in New South Wales and failed to return, prompting a large-scale search. He was discovered the following day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore, in what his father described as a "one in a million miracle." Marine Rescue crews expressed their joy at the positive outcome, and the surfer was taken for medical evaluation after his ordeal.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has provided a summer travel outlook that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as it adjusted its full-year profit forecast downward. The carrier anticipates strong third-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by robust demand for premium seating and its lucrative partnership with American Express. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while overall booking patterns have shifted, high-end consumer demand remains resilient. The airline is strategically trimming flight capacity for periods outside of the peak summer travel season to align with current, more cautious consumer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:31:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial legal victory at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled that her right to a fair hearing was violated by a Swiss court. The case stems from her challenge to World Athletics regulations that require athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) to lower their testosterone levels to compete in certain female events. While the ECHR found a procedural violation by Switzerland, it deemed her discrimination complaints inadmissible. The ruling does not immediately overturn the current athletics regulations but represents a significant step in her long-running legal battle.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) is scheduled to begin constructing three new noise barriers along Interstate 894 in Greenfield in mid-July. The project, funded by a $7 million state budget allocation, aims to reduce traffic noise for adjacent residential areas by at least eight decibels. The specific segments for the barriers were chosen after noise analyses and a vote by the affected property owners and residents. Construction, which is expected to conclude by summer 2026, will cause significant traffic disruptions, including several long-term ramp and shoulder closures along the eastbound side of the interstate.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How Ranked-Choice Voting Could Transform California's Political Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:03:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential impact of implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) in California, drawing comparisons to its use in New York City. Proponents argue that RCV could reduce election costs by eliminating runoffs, increase voter turnout, and encourage less negative campaigning. In California's top-two primary system, RCV might not prevent one-party general elections but could give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races. The author suggests the system could lead to more centrist outcomes through strategic crossover voting or, conversely, push candidates to more extreme positions, fundamentally altering campaign strategies and political alignments within the state.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece praises the expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) as a rare example of good, bipartisan policy within the recently signed "Big Beautiful Bill." The author argues that HSAs promote individual responsibility and help reduce healthcare costs by allowing for triple tax-advantaged savings. The new legislation includes several positive reforms, such as allowing individuals in certain Affordable Care Act plans to contribute to HSAs and permitting HSA funds to pay for direct primary care memberships. While acknowledging more work is needed, the article views these changes as a significant and popular step toward greater healthcare freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent trip to South Carolina is widely interpreted as an early exploration of a potential 2028 presidential run. While Newsom framed the visit as an effort to help the Democratic party in the Deep South, his presence in the crucial early primary state attracted significant attention and speculation. He touted his record of challenging the Trump administration and called for Democrats to engage more with rural communities. However, he also faces criticism from Republicans who point to California's problems and from some Democrats who view him as too progressive or slick for a national campaign.</p>

The collapse occurred at an 18-foot diameter tunnel being built for wastewater management, trapping the workers behind a large pile of soil. The workers were able to move over the debris to meet colleagues and were then shuttled out in groups through the five-mile-long tunnel. Over 100 LAFD responders, including specialized Urban Search and Rescue teams, were at the scene, with officials calling the outcome a blessing with no injuries reported.</p>

          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a zonal pricing system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographic location. Instead, it will focus on reforming the current national pricing system. Proponents of zonal pricing, like Octopus Energy's CEO, argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland and encourage industry to relocate. However, some major energy firms like SSE warned the change could deter investment. The decision provides policy clarity for the industry but, according to some analysts, fails to resolve the deep-rooted issues in Great Britain's electricity market. (not investment advice)</p>

Whitehouse, who recently delivered his 300th climate-related speech on the Senate floor, believes that aggressively exposing the industry's influence and the public's widespread support for climate action could break the political stalemate.
