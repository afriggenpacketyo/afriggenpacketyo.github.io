          <p>Grammy-winning artist Cardi B recently discussed her reputation for being outspoken and its connection to her upcoming album, titled 'Am I the Drama?'. In an interview, she explained that her big personality and candid nature often make her an easy target for controversy, causing stress despite her not actively seeking conflict. She acknowledged that this reputation for being dramatic has followed her since high school, where she was voted 'most dramatic' in her yearbook. The new album's title is a self-aware nod to this public perception, embracing the persona that has frequently placed her in headlines.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 6-Month Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Impact on Heirs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation for reverse mortgages, known as the '6-month rule,' dictates the timeline for heirs after the homeowner passes away or permanently leaves the residence. Lenders must issue a 'Due and Payable' letter, giving the estate six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to settle the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) and is crucial for estate planning, as unprepared families may struggle to keep the home. While extensions are possible with HUD approval, the rule emphasizes the need for borrowers to communicate clearly with their families about how the loan will be managed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second official state visit, an honor unprecedented for a modern U.S. president. Hosted by King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the visit will feature royal pageantry at Windsor Castle and high-level political discussions. The agenda includes the announcement of over $10 billion in energy and technology deals and talks on trade tariffs, particularly concerning British steel. Despite the formal ceremonies, the visit is accompanied by planned protests in London and Windsor from groups critical of the U.S. President's policies and rhetoric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Webtoon Entertainment experienced a significant surge, climbing over 35%, after the company announced an expanded deal with Disney. The agreement involves creating a new, unified digital comics platform for Disney's popular Marvel and Star Wars brands, making over 35,000 comics available under a single subscription. As part of the deal, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon, further solidifying the partnership. Analysts view this as a major validation of Webtoon's platform, potentially attracting other major intellectual property holders and providing a stable, recurring revenue stream for the company.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring full access to the Visa Waiver Program after Hungary addressed key security vulnerabilities. The U.S. had previously curtailed privileges in 2021 and 2023, citing concerns that a simplified naturalization process had granted citizenship to nearly one million people without adequate security screening. Effective September 30, the validity period for travel authorizations will be restored to two years, allowing multiple entries. This move signals a significant warming of diplomatic ties between Washington and Budapest, a relationship that President Trump has actively cultivated.</p>

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, divers have recovered artifacts from the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. The vessel, which was serving as a hospital ship during World War I, struck a mine and sank in the Aegean Sea. An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved several items from the wreck, which lies nearly 400 feet deep, including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated first-class trays. The recovered artifacts are now undergoing conservation in Athens and will become part of a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities being developed in Greece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's willingness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that motivated China to move forward with a deal. Bessent explained that the President made it clear national security would not be compromised, which 'turned the tide' in negotiations with the app's parent company, ByteDance. While a framework for U.S. investors to take over the app's American operations is in place, the deal still needs to be finalized ahead of a looming deadline. The administration's tough stance, including tariff threats, is credited with pressuring China to reach an agreement to avoid a shutdown.</p>

          <p>A retrospective article revisits Europe's dramatic and unexpected Ryder Cup victory at Oak Hill in 1995, one of only four times they have won on American soil. Led by captain Bernard Gallacher, the underdog European team overcame internal selection disputes, injuries, and a 9-7 deficit heading into the final day's singles matches. The comeback was sealed by clutch performances from players like Nick Faldo and a final, nerve-wracking point secured by rookie Philip Walton.

          <p>Following his death at age 89, this essay reflects on Robert Redford's unique screen presence, arguing that his talent was often underappreciated because he made acting look effortless. Unlike more theatrical performers, Redford's craft was subtle, often revealed in contrast to his co-stars or the expansive settings of his films, from 'All the President's Men' to 'Jeremiah Johnson'. The article suggests his iconic good looks sometimes distracted from his nuanced ability to convey a character's inner thoughts and anchor a film's emotional core. His legacy is defined by this quiet mastery, which made his characters feel authentic and grounded in a genuine reality.</p>

          <p>As a commodity viewed as a safe-haven asset, the price of gold is subject to constant fluctuation based on numerous global factors. As of mid-September 2025, the price stood at approximately $3,652 per ounce. Key drivers of its value include fundamental supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates, as investors often use gold to hedge against eroding currency values. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty, central bank policies, and movements in the U.S. dollar can significantly impact its price, making it a dynamic but historically stable investment for those looking to preserve wealth during turbulent times.

          <p>With mortgage rates recently dropping to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering whether now is the right time to refinance. Experts suggest that homeowners with rates above 7% should begin exploring their options, as current refinance rates are significantly lower. Key considerations include personal financial needs, such as a desire to lower monthly payments or consolidate high-interest credit card debt through a cash-out refinance. While rates may fall further, financial advisors warn against trying to perfectly time the market, as the cost of waiting with a higher rate can often outweigh the potential future savings.

          <p>Sources familiar with negotiations report that technology giant Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake are central to the deal framework that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States. The final structure of the agreement between the Trump administration and China is still being finalized but will involve a consortium of new and existing investors taking over the social media company's U.S. operations. Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison is a friend of President Trump, has previously partnered with TikTok to manage U.S. user data.
