          <p>Jared Isaacman, founder of Shift4 Payments, addressed his withdrawn NASA nomination, stating his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience." President Trump pulled the nomination after a review of Isaacman's prior associations, possibly related to donations to Democrats, but Isaacman believes the timing was linked to Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill. Isaacman, who has led private spaceflights with SpaceX, noted Musk's increasing attacks on the bill, which he called a "disgusting abomination." Isaacman will step down as CEO of Shift4, succeeded by Taylor Lauber, while remaining as executive chairman. His continued involvement suggests a dedication to the company's future.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has returned a Guatemalan man, O.C.G., to the United States after a judge ruled he was wrongly deported without due process. O.C.G., who sought asylum due to violent attacks in Guatemala, was deported to Mexico despite an immigration judge's order barring his removal to any country other than Guatemala. Judge Brian Murphy mandated his return after the Justice Department admitted it had no witness to verify its account of O.C.G.'s removal. His legal team is now working to contact eight other defendants allegedly flown to East Africa without due process. This case highlights ongoing concerns about immigration enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaaty assured Greece that Egypt will safeguard the historic Saint Catherine's Monastery, following a court ruling that raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites, while stating the land is public.

Established in the sixth century, Saint Catherine's Monastery is the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery, holding significant religious and historical importance.
