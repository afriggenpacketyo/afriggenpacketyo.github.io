          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating with several quantum computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, to acquire equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with a broader strategy of taking ownership in industries deemed vital to national security, following similar investments in rare earths and semiconductors. The policy reflects a strategic focus on technological competition with China, as quantum computing holds significant potential for economic and security advancements but also poses new cybersecurity risks. The news caused a significant surge in the stock prices of the mentioned firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is seeking to convert its Chinese loans into yuan, a move that could significantly reduce its debt-servicing interest rates and provide critical fiscal relief. This follows a similar action by Kenya, which is saving an estimated $215 million annually after converting $3.5 billion of its Chinese debt. The trend, also seen in Sri Lanka and Hungary, aligns with Beijing's strategic goal of accelerating the internationalization of its currency. Ethiopia's request was made as it negotiates the restructuring of approximately $15 billion in external debt under the G20 Common Framework. (not investment advice)</p>

Loomis, who previously served as a trade attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, will oversee daily operations and government relations. The appointment comes as the aviation giant faces significant challenges, including Chinese restrictions on accepting new Boeing jets and U.S. threats to limit aircraft part exports.

Zhang, who escaped from house arrest in Mexico in July, is accused of laundering millions and working with the Sinaloa and Jalisco drug cartels to traffic fentanyl precursors from China. His arrest is a significant development in the U.S. effort to curb the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid. Mexican authorities are now awaiting a decision on whether he will be deported or extradited to face charges.</p>

          <p>China's major economic hubs, Shanghai and Beijing, have reported GDP growth for the first nine months of the year that surpasses the national average, indicating strengthening domestic demand.

Beijing posted 5.6% growth, led by its information services, finance, and technology industries. While these figures suggest a steady recovery, officials caution that external uncertainties persist and continued policy support is necessary to solidify the positive economic trend.

          <p>Germany's Finance Ministry has announced it will cover the October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at U.S. military bases in the country to prevent non-payment due to the U.S. government shutdown. The ministry described the temporary funding as an "unscheduled expenditure" and a "sign of solidarity" with the U.S. armed forces stationed in Germany. German officials stated they anticipate being reimbursed by the U.S. once its government funding is restored. The move ensures that local civilian staff will not face financial hardship while the political stalemate in Washington continues.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has scaled back wind and rain warnings for the UK as Storm Benjamin, named by French forecasters, moves away toward the east. The storm brought its most severe winds, with gusts up to 100mph, to the northern coast of France. In the UK, the impact was less severe, though it caused some travel disruption and power outages for over 2,000 homes in Suffolk. Yellow warnings for rain and wind remain in effect for parts of eastern England, but the overall threat of widespread flooding and damage has diminished as the storm system clears the country.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur, a dome-headed dinosaur, in Mongolia, which they have named Zavacephale rinpoche. The specimen is 15 million years older than any previous find and is the most complete pachycephalosaur skeleton ever unearthed, offering unprecedented insights into the creature's anatomy. The fossil reveals that even juvenile pachycephalosaurs had fully developed, thick skulls, suggesting they engaged in head-butting behavior from a young age. The discovery fills a critical gap in the evolutionary history of this unique group of dinosaurs and is now housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences.</p>

The 28-page document outlines federal demands for sweeping policy changes at the university related to admissions, protest rules, and gender-affirming care, which faculty groups have sought to make public. The ruling is a victory for transparency advocates who argue the public has a right to know the details of negotiations that could profoundly affect one of the nation's top public universities. UC had argued that releasing the proposal would create an "uncontrollable public fray."</p>

          <p>California saw a record number of zero-emission and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2025, as consumers rushed to utilize federal tax credits before their elimination under President Trump's budget. Clean vehicles constituted 29% of all new car sales in the state during this period, the highest quarterly market share ever recorded. However, with the incentives now gone and EVs remaining more expensive than comparable gas models, industry experts express concern about maintaining this momentum. The surge in sales is seen as a "pulling-forward" of purchases, with a potential drop-off in demand expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film 'Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere' focuses on the contemplative and difficult period in which Bruce Springsteen created his 1982 acoustic album, 'Nebraska.' Starring Jeremy Allen White, the movie avoids typical biopic tropes to present a character study about the creative process, exploring how Springsteen channeled his personal demons and memories into his music. The article praises the film's authentic style and its focus on the technical aspects of the album's home recording. While lauded as a thoughtful exploration, the review notes that the film loses its way in the final act, meandering without a clear resolution.</p>
