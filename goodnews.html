          <p>Bishop T.D. Jakes is stepping down as the senior pastor of The Potter's House, a Dallas megachurch he founded in 1996 and grew to over 30,000 members. He has officially installed his daughter, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and his son-in-law, Toure Roberts, as the new co-senior pastors. This leadership transition has reportedly been planned for years and follows a significant health incident in late 2024 where Jakes suffered a heart attack during a service. Jakes will continue his work as chairman of the T.D. Jakes Foundation and head of his other media and outreach enterprises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to extend statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, offering time to grieve without needing to use sick leave. While advocates and MPs have praised the move as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement, some small business owners have expressed concerns about the financial impact of staff taking additional time off.</p>

          <p>Alexa Nicholls Costa, a Boston-based nurse practitioner and aesthetician, is providing free assistance to her clients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) by administering their hormone injections. Having gone through the stressful process herself, Costa recognized the anxiety and potential for error many patients face with self-injections. She began offering the service after hours, helping more than 15 patients who have all had successful pregnancies. Costa is now collaborating with a fertility clinic to develop a program that would send trained nurses to patients' homes to administer the shots, aiming to reduce a major barrier in the difficult IVF journey.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates in the short term but signal future cuts, savers are questioning whether to lock in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) now. Financial experts suggest that opening a CD in July could be a strategic move to secure currently high yields before rates potentially drop later in the year. Key considerations include personal liquidity, as CD funds are locked for a set term, and financial goals. Experts also recommend strategies like CD laddering—opening multiple CDs with different maturity dates—to balance returns with access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

To protect privacy, it recommends reviewing app permissions, using privacy-focused tools like DuckDuckGo, and employing data removal services to systematically request that brokers delete personal information from their databases, thereby helping individuals regain some control over their digital footprint.</p>

          <p>The umpire at the center of an electronic line-calling failure at Wimbledon, Nico Helwerth, was not scheduled for matches on Monday, with officials stating he was having a routine rest day. The controversy occurred when the ball-tracking system malfunctioned during a key point, leading Helwerth to replay the point instead of making an overrule. While the All England Club stated Helwerth followed established protocols, he was criticized by player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who claimed he later admitted he should have intervened. The incident has sparked debate about the role of chair umpires in the age of automated line-calling.</p>

          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require taking full responsibility, demonstrating genuine empathy, and presenting a clear plan for corrective action, according to communication expert Lorraine K. Lee. The timing of an apology is critical; leaders should acknowledge issues promptly and follow up with a thoughtful response. An apology that sounds rehearsed, lacks emotion, or fails to show vulnerability can erode trust and damage morale. Ultimately, people want to hear from a human leader, not a corporate brand, and a well-executed apology can be a powerful tool for rebuilding credibility and fostering positive change.</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to lure top-tier directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Kathryn Bigelow, even though the company largely forgoes wide theatrical releases. The streaming giant attracts this talent by offering substantial financial backing, significant creative freedom, and access to a global subscriber base of over 300 million. For many filmmakers, Netflix provides a home for projects that traditional studios might deem too expensive or risky. By avoiding the high marketing costs of theatrical runs, Netflix can invest heavily in production and secure deals that are difficult for creatives to refuse.</p>
