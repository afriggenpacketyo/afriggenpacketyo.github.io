          <p>China has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of its low-altitude economy. This sector, which includes activities up to 1,000 meters, has been designated a strategic emerging industry by Beijing to drive innovation and job creation. The new role involves planning multi-drone flight paths, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations for a variety of applications. This move by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security signals the formalization of new professions spurred by technological advancements and dedicated government support for the burgeoning drone industry.</p>

          <p>Anna Kalinskaya advanced to the Washington Open final after defeating Emma Raducanu in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve late in the first set and maintained her momentum, overcoming an early exchange of breaks in the second to secure the victory. The win prevents a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez. Instead, Kalinskaya will face Fernandez, who reached the final after a grueling three-set victory over Elena Rybakina, as she aims for her first WTA 500 title.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate their direction, an achievement considered god-like for its time. Despite its historical significance, some modern scholars have dismissed it as a myth, and it was removed from Chinese school curricula in 2017. Using modern scientific principles and new clues, the researchers hope to restore the lost wonder and validate its place in the history of seismology.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ligament injury. An MRI confirmed there was no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, providing relief to the team and its fans. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks. He hopes to initially return as a designated hitter, while the team navigates the absence of its most productive offensive player.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering him not just as a heavy metal pioneer but also as an early 2000s reality television icon. His MTV show, "The Osbournes," which ran from 2002 to 2005, offered an unprecedented and often mundane look into the life of his famous family, pioneering the "reality sitcom" format. The show's blend of celebrity life with everyday family frustrations resonated with millions, turning the Black Sabbath frontman into a lovable, albeit chaotic, TV dad.

          <p>As football fans anticipate the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions associated with watching high-stakes matches. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an increased heart rate, anxiety, and even affect sleep and behavior after the game. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression, regardless of the final score.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in over 20 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. Experts note that while the start of summer has been cold, the region's hottest weather often arrives in September.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing struggling town centers. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas in designated zones, making it easier to open bars in disused shops and promote al fresco activities. While the government touts the changes as a boost for hospitality, the opposition has criticized the plan as hypocritical, blaming Labour's tax policies for the industry's struggles.</p>
