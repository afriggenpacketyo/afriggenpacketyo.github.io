          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative, "AI Fluency," requiring all incoming students to study artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. The program aims to equip graduates with essential AI skills for a job market that has seen a 619% increase in demand for such expertise over the past decade. While some remain skeptical about AI's impact on critical thinking, the university believes this requirement will provide its students with a significant competitive advantage in the workforce. The initiative includes a mandatory generative AI course and workshops focused on practical, real-world applications of the technology.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's move, described as a "risk management cut," was widely expected and signaled the possibility of two more reductions by the end of the year. While the Japanese market reacted positively, other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi rising and Australia's ASX 200 declining. The Bank of Japan is currently holding its own policy meeting, with most economists predicting it will maintain its current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has introduced the company's first consumer smart glasses featuring a built-in digital display, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, priced at $799. The device allows users to view content like videos and text messages and is controlled by hand gestures via a neural-powered wristband. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's existing audio-only smart glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. The company also announced new models in its Oakley sports line and an updated version of its original Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved battery and camera capabilities.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center indicate the storm will remain over open water for several days and poses no immediate threat to land. However, meteorologists predict it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its path is uncertain, the system could approach Bermuda next week, and officials are monitoring its development closely during what has been a quieter-than-anticipated hurricane season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fruit with a low alcohol content, amounting to a daily intake equivalent to nearly two human cocktails. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol in figs and plums eaten by the primates, confirming a long-held "drunken monkey" hypothesis that our attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots. The study notes that the chimps are not getting drunk but are exposed to a steady, low dose of alcohol. This research provides the first direct chemical measurements linking naturally fermented fruit to the daily dietary intake of wild chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>A UK Education Select Committee report has urged the government not to scrap the current system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs. The MPs recommend keeping the legally binding plans as a crucial accountability measure for parents. The report also calls for establishing new national minimum standards for special needs support in all schools and investing in more training for teachers. This comes as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been described as financially unsustainable despite rising demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate steady at 4% when it meets on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk further cuts at this time. The decision comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its own rates, highlighting differing economic conditions and policy paths among major Western economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time this year, a direct response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its own rates. Due to the city's currency peg to the U.S. dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority typically moves in lockstep with the Fed to maintain financial stability. The rate reduction is intended to lower the cost of funding for businesses and ease the burden on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's decision was prompted by signs of a softening labor market in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
