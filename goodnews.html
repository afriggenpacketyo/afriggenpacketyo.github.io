        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a prolonged drought in the tech sector, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market is displaying signs of a potential revival. This optimism is largely driven by the successful market debut of crypto company Circle, which saw its stock surge significantly, and the strong performance of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave. Venture capital firms, which have faced pressure to deliver returns to their investors, are cautiously optimistic about this trend. While major companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain private, the recent increase in IPO activity suggests a potential end to the liquidity challenges that have plagued the industry for over three years.

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has identified five types of food he avoids feeding his children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to build better eating habits from childhood.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Italy's Matteo Bellucci in straight sets to advance to the fourth round of Wimbledon, becoming the last remaining British player in the men's singles competition. Playing on Court One, Norrie overcame a challenging first set before finding his rhythm to secure a 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory. He revealed he drew energy from the crowd, a tactic he learned from Andy Murray, to help him through the match.

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, primarily because it introduced the concept of the "citizen." In a recent interview, he argued that before the revolution, people were merely subjects under a ruler, and the Declaration of Independence fundamentally "turned the world upside down." Burns emphasized that while the original document was exclusionary, its aspirational language inspired movements for equality for centuries. He advocates for embracing the complexities of American history to create a richer, more inclusive national story.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested a novel way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States next year: hosting a UFC fight on the White House lawn. During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of setting up an octagon for a championship bout, stating that UFC CEO Dana White, a supporter, would handle the event. The proposal is unprecedented, as the White House has never hosted a major professional sporting event of this kind. The president has been a frequent attendee at UFC events since returning to office.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would harm numerous nesting seabird populations on the atoll. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the rocket delivery tests.</p>

          <p>Sales of cars manufactured in China reached a new high in the United Kingdom, accounting for one in every ten new cars sold in June. This surge, which includes brands like MG, BYD, and Omoda, marks a significant increase from 6% a year ago. The growth is particularly notable as other Western countries have recently imposed steep tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports, a measure the UK has not yet adopted. The trend reflects the growing competitiveness and innovation of Chinese automakers, particularly in the electric vehicle sector, posing a challenge to the established industry.

This shift is less about speculative trading and more about utilizing the blockchain for its utility, security, and stability. Despite price volatility, institutional adoption is growing, reinforcing Ethereum's position as the potential back-end for the future of global finance. (not investment advice)</p>
