Amidst a legal action by member Felix against a defaming social media user, the band maintains a strong, intimate connection with their dedicated fanbase, STAY, through online interactions and engaging, interactive live performances that collapse the distance between stage and audience.</p>

          <p>Yang Weimin, a former senior official, urged China to make greater efforts to boost household income over the next five years, emphasizing consumption as the key driver for future economic growth. His comments precede the upcoming fourth plenum of the Communist Party's Central Committee, where the country's next five-year plan will be discussed, likely focusing on income and GDP growth, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation. Yang specifically highlighted the critical need to raise the share of household disposable income in national income and boost consumer spending's share of total demand. This strategy aims to fundamentally address the issue of weak consumer demand in the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mars Public Library in Butler County, Pennsylvania, is seeking crucial community input on a possible expansion or relocation, driven by rapidly increasing demand in Adams, Middlesex, Valencia, and Mars Borough. The library is "busting at the seams," with programs consistently selling out and membership card numbers nearly doubling since 2018. Previous plans to expand into an old Mars National Bank space failed due to funding shortfalls. Now, surveys are being distributed to residents to gauge preferences on a new facility, including potential locations and willingness to support a tax increase, as local leaders aim to make a decision by the end of October.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly stated that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank, declaring, "It's not going to happen. There's been enough, it's time to stop." This assertion followed a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concerning the Gaza conflict and came amidst ongoing pressure from far-right Israeli officials advocating for such annexation. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud had previously warned Trump that any Israeli annexation of the West Bank would significantly jeopardize peace prospects in Gaza and destabilize the broader Middle East. Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War, with its settlements there considered illegal under international law.</p>

          <p>Raynae Madison and her family made a remarkable discovery at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, unearthing a nearly 3-carat brown diamond, which they named the William Diamond. This impressive 2.79-carat find marks the third-largest diamond registered at the park this year. Park interpreter Emma O'Neal explained that brown diamonds from the Crater occur due to plastic deformation, a process creating structural defects during the diamond's formation or movement in magma. The 800-acre state park, where visitors can actively search for gemstones, has a rich history of over 75,000 diamonds discovered since 1906, continuing its unique legacy.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has quietly moved out of the takeover spotlight, with its shares climbing over 32% since early April, outperforming many U.S. and European rivals. This improved sentiment is attributed to a fundamental strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, progress on its cost-cutting program, and a string of recent oil discoveries. Earlier intense speculation about potential suitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil has now subsided. BP's CEO emphasized the company's focus on growth, backed by significantly stronger second-quarter results and promising new finds, such as in Brazil's Santos Basin. Analysts have upgraded BP's rating, citing its successful turnaround efforts and renewed confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 238 into law, an urgency measure providing victims of the January 7 firestorms up to one year of mortgage relief. This legislation allows affected borrowers to pause payments for up to 12 months without late fees or penalties, simply by attesting to financial hardship. The law also explicitly prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating foreclosures or negatively impacting credit scores, and bans lump-sum repayments after the forbearance period. This comprehensive relief aims to significantly ease the financial burden on thousands of homeowners struggling with rebuilding their homes and navigating complex insurance claims in the aftermath of the devastating fires.</p>

          <p>President Trump has formally approved a deal for U.S. investors to acquire TikTok's American operations, creating a new $14 billion company to avert a U.S. ban mandated by Congress. Key investors, including Oracle, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Dell, and Silver Lake, are expected to control a new algorithm trained solely on U.S. user data, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. This agreement aims to address national security concerns regarding potential Chinese government access to user data and influence operations. While Trump claims Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal, Beijing's public statements have been more cautious, and questions persist about the new app's global content access and user experience.</p>
