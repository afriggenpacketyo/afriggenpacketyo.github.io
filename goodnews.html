          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has opened designated sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project from the 2024 Olympics. The city invested approximately €1.4 billion to improve water quality, which had been compromised by pollution since the ban was enacted in 1923. Three supervised swimming zones with amenities are now available, though authorities will continuously monitor water safety and swimmers' abilities due to strong currents. This initiative is part of a broader city effort to adapt to climate change and enhance urban life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's rugby team narrowly defeated the Maori All Blacks 29-26 in a tightly contested match in Whangarei, New Zealand, to open their summer tour. Both teams scored four tries, but a first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately made the difference for the visiting side. Despite being outmatched in possession and metres gained, Scotland demonstrated clinical attacking and resilient defense, particularly in the final moments. The victory was secured by a largely second-string Scottish squad, which held off a late surge from the hosts to clinch the win.</p>

          <p>A new amateur football league in China's Jiangsu province is experiencing a surge in popularity, drawing millions of online viewers and tens of thousands of stadium attendees. The league, now in its first season, features 13 teams composed of a diverse mix of players, from teenagers to farmers. This grassroots phenomenon highlights a growing local passion for the sport, with fans even petitioning for a military flyover for the league's final match. The success of the event demonstrates how localized, community-driven sports can capture widespread attention and rival more professionalized leagues in fan engagement.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify "Genetic Switch" for Organ Regeneration in Mice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have successfully restored damaged ear tissue in mice by activating what they describe as an "evolutionarily disabled genetic switch." Their research, published in the journal Science, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete restoration of the lost tissue, including cartilage. The researchers believe this discovery proves the existence of a fundamental mechanism for regeneration that could potentially be present in other organs and, one day, be applied to humans.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured a spot in the Club World Cup semi-finals with a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras, but the standout performance came from a future Chelsea player. Estevao Willian, an 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid signed by Chelsea, scored a spectacular equalizing goal for Palmeiras in what was his final game for the club. Despite his impressive display, a late own goal by Palmeiras handed the win to the London side. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised Estevao's immense talent, giving fans an exciting preview of the skills he will bring to the team.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it provided a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at pausing the war with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, a development President Trump described as optimistic. The proposal reportedly includes a two-month ceasefire, though Israel has not yet publicly committed to the terms. This diplomatic movement comes as the Palestinian death toll in the 21-month conflict surpasses 57,000, and humanitarian groups raise alarms over civilian deaths near aid distribution sites.</p>

          <p>British rock band Oasis performed their first concert in 16 years, launching a highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, to a crowd of over 60,000. The famously feuding Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, put aside their differences to play a set filled with their 1990s Britpop hits like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever." While the brothers largely kept their distance on stage, the performance was powerful and sparked massive sing-alongs from fans who had traveled from around the world. The show marked the beginning of a 19-date tour across the UK and Ireland.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, becoming the first foreign leader to receive it. The award was presented during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties, particularly in energy and health. The visit highlighted the deep historical connections between the two countries, rooted in the 19th-century migration of Indian indentured laborers. As part of the renewed strategic partnership, Modi also announced expanded eligibility for Overseas Citizen of India cards for people of Indian descent in the nation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' front office has indicated that their trade deadline plans will not significantly change following third baseman Max Muncy's recent knee injury. While the collision initially looked severe, Muncy only sustained a bone bruise and is expected to return in about six weeks, leaving him time to recover before the playoffs. General Manager Brandon Gomes stated the team is content to rely on internal options to fill the position in the interim. The unexpectedly positive diagnosis means the Dodgers are not desperately seeking an external replacement and can stick to their original strategy.</p>

          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led New York City officials to temporarily close a stretch of beach on the Fourth of July. Drones and lifeguards monitored the sharks, which were observed swimming very close to the shore and beachgoers. The city's deputy mayor for public safety confirmed the sightings and noted that the beach was closed for about an hour as a precaution before reopening. The incident occurred just days after New York state officials had announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>As the United States takes aim at China's dominant shipbuilding industry, competitors South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to capture a larger market share. South Korea's new presidential administration has pledged to support its domestic industry, which it describes as being in a "major crisis," by focusing on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels. The policy guidelines aim to revitalize the sector through improved production, digitalization, and better working conditions. This strategic shift comes as geopolitical tensions create an opportunity for traditional shipbuilding powerhouses to challenge China's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>
