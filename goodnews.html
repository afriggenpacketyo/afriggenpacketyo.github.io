          <p>Thomas Jefferson's Monticello has introduced a new tour focusing on the complex relationship between Jefferson and John Adams to encourage reflection on today's toxic politics. The tour explores their collaboration on the Declaration of Independence, their rivalry in the 1800 election, and their reconciliation later in life. Monticello aims to use this historical context to foster civic dialogue and inspire visitors to bridge contemporary political divides. The initiative reflects Monticello's ongoing commitment to addressing difficult conversations, including slavery, and promoting a more nuanced understanding of American history.</p>

The tour focuses on the two men's lives, friendship, and political disagreements.

          <p>A tour is being offered at Monticello to examine the relationship between Jefferson and Adams. The tour is called "Founding Friends, Founding Foes". The tour is intended to help heal the hyper-polarized politics of today. The tour will use spaces in the magnificent house Jefferson designed, and items he kept close to him, to unpack their lifelong frenemyship. The tour will explore the vicious partisan politics of the 1790s, and the rise of the two-party system we know today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay explores the decline of deep male friendships in America, noting that men today report having fewer close friends compared to previous generations. The author reflects on his own experiences, highlighting the intensity and emotional intimacy he once shared with male friends, which has diminished over time. The article attributes this decline to societal expectations around masculinity, which discourage emotional vulnerability and prioritize romantic relationships and family over friendships. The piece suggests that a shift towards more open and expressive male friendships could improve men's overall well-being.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder, challenging the notion that the Defund the Police movement failed. It argues that despite setbacks like unsuccessful ballot amendments, the movement significantly shifted public opinion and political discourse, bringing radical ideas into the mainstream. The piece highlights that the movement achieved over $840 million in cuts from US police departments and $160 million in investments in community services, with numerous cities reducing their police budgets or removing police from schools. The author stresses that systemic change takes time and perseverance, urging unity and continued fighting for justice in the face of ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalised, making it the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The government called the move a "new dawn for rail" but held back from promising lower fares, focusing more on plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure. On a visit to a train depot in Bournemouth, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the nationalisation of SWR as a "real watershed moment". The government hopes to find ways to cut the cost of rail travel.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency found fragments of the virus in Retford, Nottinghamshire, prompting increased surveillance in the area. The expert emphasizes the importance of taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, while noting that the discovery is part of a broader trend of tropical viral diseases expanding their range northward.</p>
