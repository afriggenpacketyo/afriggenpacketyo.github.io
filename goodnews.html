          <p>CBS News has launched a price tracker to monitor the increasing costs of essential household expenses like food, gas, utilities, and housing. This tool utilizes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index and average price data, focusing on items that significantly impact household budgets or have seen substantial changes since 2022. It aims to help consumers understand the ongoing cost-of-living pressures and the potential effects of tariffs on their daily expenditures. The tracker provides a clear overview of how quickly prices are rising across various categories.</p>

          <p>As of September 2, 2025, the national average savings interest rate is 0.39%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher returns, ranging from 4.15% to 4.35%. Financial experts recommend these accounts for emergency funds due to their safety and interest-earning potential, which helps money grow faster than traditional options. Online banks often provide the best rates by having lower overhead costs, making them accessible even with minimal initial deposits. Comparing different online accounts is crucial to secure the most favorable terms and maximize savings growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure investment option, with current top rates exceeding the inflation rate. As of September 9, 2025, national average CD yields vary by term, but leading online banks offer competitive rates, such as 4.45% APY for 6-month CDs. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than longer terms, suggesting strategies like CD laddering. These FDIC or NCUA-insured investments up to $250,000 provide a safe way to lock in returns (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey reveals that ultra-wealthy family offices are increasing their allocation to public equities, now averaging 31%, while reducing their private equity holdings to 21%. This shift, particularly notable in the U.S. and Americas, indicates a "pro-risk asset mix" despite rising geopolitical and inflation concerns. Many family offices are leveraging public equities and ETFs to invest in artificial intelligence, with 86% already having some AI exposure. They also opportunistically invest in private equity secondaries, taking advantage of liquidity needs from other market players (not investment advice).</p>

These products leverage substantial home equity, currently averaging over $300,000, and are expected to become even more attractive with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Homeowners can also benefit from potential tax deductions for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations. However, it is crucial to compare lenders and understand the risks, as the home serves as collateral (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As of September 10, 2025, the price of gold is $3,645.78 per ounce, a value subject to constant fluctuation. Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, particularly attractive during periods of market or economic uncertainty. Its price is influenced by supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and currency movements. Central bank policies and overall market sentiment also play significant roles in determining gold's value, making it a dynamic investment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry expressed disbelief regarding allegations that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer circumvented the NBA's salary cap. Reports suggested Ballmer invested in a third-party company, Aspiration, which then signed superstar Kawhi Leonard to a sponsorship deal requiring minimal obligations, allegedly to pay Leonard off-book. Lasry, citing his long-standing relationship with Ballmer and Dennis Wong, vouched for their integrity, stating NBA rules are well-known and strictly followed. While the NBA is investigating, Lasry believes the claims are "a lot of smoke, but I don't think there's much there."</p>

          <h2>The Decline of Teen Babysitting and Its Impact on Youth Development and Community Ties</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the cultural shift away from teenagers babysitting, a role increasingly filled by professional adults. Once a common rite of passage, teen babysitting provided valuable "independence challenges" and social skills, fostering responsibility and financial literacy. Experts note that today's teens are busier, and increased safety concerns combined with intensive parenting expectations have professionalized childcare. This decline also reflects a broader weakening of community ties, suggesting that reinvigorating the practice could strengthen interfamily bonds and provide unique developmental benefits for both sitters and younger children.</p>
