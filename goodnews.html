          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was cited for speeding early Tuesday morning in Ohio, according to police records obtained by ESPN. The 23-year-old was driving 101 mph in a 60 mph zone in a Dodge TRX truck. Sanders, son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, faces the option of paying a fine or contesting the ticket in court next month. He is also competing for the Browns' starting quarterback role among a crowded quarterback room that includes veterans and fellow draftees.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker, known as "Streeter," has left his marketing job to make over six figures by reporting idling vehicles through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. In New York City, trucks and non-city buses are prohibited from idling for more than three minutes. Streeter spends 6-9 hours daily biking and recording idling vehicles, reporting them to the city and receiving 25% of the fines, which range from $350 to $600. While some truck drivers view the program as a "bounty hunter" scheme, advocates argue it addresses a significant public health issue.</p>

          <p>Mark Walter, controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is reportedly set to acquire a majority ownership stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at a franchise valuation of $10 billion, marking the richest transaction in sports history. This move signals a potential shift in the Lakers' approach, with expectations of significant investments in infrastructure, coaching, and scouting, mirroring the Dodgers' success under Walter's leadership. While Jeanie Buss will remain as Lakers governor, the new ownership is anticipated to prioritize sustained championship contention, potentially impacting the team's reliance on aging superstars. The acquisition aims to bring a renewed championship vision and effective championship culture to the Lakers, drawing parallels with the Dodgers' consistent playoff appearances and World Series titles.</p>

The bear was first spotted on a trail camera as a cub in 2023 with the lid around its neck, and the Department of Natural Resources had been searching for it since. The bear was lured into a cylindrical trap, anesthetized, and the lid was cut off, and despite scarring on its neck, the bear was in surprisingly good condition.

          <p>A California appeals court sided with a former middle school student, Eleri Irons, who sued the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect her from bullying. The court upheld a $1-million jury verdict awarded to Irons in 2022, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees. Irons was bullied by three students from November 2017 to June 2018, with the harassment escalating despite her attempts to seek help from school staff. The court rejected the district's arguments, stating that El Segundo had a duty to protect Irons and that school employees did not follow proper bullying procedures.</p>
