          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed concerns from banking advocacy groups regarding stablecoin rewards, arguing that banks are attempting to stifle competition. Banks are urging lawmakers to prohibit crypto exchanges like Coinbase from offering rewards that are structured like interest payments. Armstrong dismisses the banks' arguments as a "boogeyman" tactic to protect their payment business revenue, while crypto groups argue that preventing exchanges from offering rewards would favor larger banks. Senator Cynthia Lummis believes the issue was settled in the GENIUS Act, supporting the compromise between banks and the digital asset industry, indicating a potential stalemate in regulatory changes.

          <p>Microsoft is investing $4 billion to construct a second data center in Wisconsin, complementing its initial $3.3 billion investment in a nearby Mount Pleasant facility. The first data center will house Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs, crucial for AI model handling, reflecting the increasing demand for cloud infrastructure to support AI technologies. Microsoft aims to match its energy consumption with carbon-free energy contributions and is constructing a solar farm to supply power. The new data center is expected to be operational in 2027, and the state's governor, Tony Evers, highlighted that Wisconsin will host the largest number of GPUs under one roof, solidifying the state's position in the AI infrastructure landscape. </p>

          <p>The IRS and Treasury finalized rules for Secure 2.0 Act provisions, impacting 401(k) catch-up contributions for workers aged 50 and older. Starting in 2027, higher earners must make Roth (after-tax) catch-up contributions, while some plans may implement this change in 2026. Experts recommend consulting with advisors to determine whether to accelerate pre-tax contributions or transition to Roth sooner. For 2025, workers can defer up to $23,500, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older, and a "super catch-up" for workers aged 60 to 63, and financial planners advise investors to proactively address these changes.

In India-administered Kashmir's Doda district, officials recently banned meat, seafood, and eggs in educational institutions, citing secular principles and social harmony, leading to concerns about individual freedom. Many individuals face housing challenges due to their dietary preferences, with some landlords rejecting meat-eaters. The connection between vegetarianism and Hindu cultural identity shapes social norms, often stigmatizing meat consumption and associating it with religious minorities and marginalized groups, despite the fact that a significant portion of the population consumes meat regularly. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of Guatemalan minors after the government walked back claims that it intended to reunite the youths with their parents. Judge Timothy Kelly expressed skepticism, noting declarations from minors fearing violence or neglect in Guatemala. The judge raised concerns about a Guatemalan attorney general report indicating no parents requested their children's return. The lawsuit arose after 70 minors were transferred to a plane bound for Guatemala, despite some having pending asylum cases, effectively extending a restraining order preventing their imminent deportation, as the Trump administration could appeal the decision. </p>

          <p>The stock market reached record highs as Wall Street anticipated a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, which eventually occurred. The Fed announced a quarter percentage point reduction, the first since December 2024, though the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished down slightly. Palo Alto Networks and Broadcom saw significant gains due to better-than-expected earnings reports, while Eli Lilly shares outperformed due to positive announcements regarding weight loss treatments and new plant construction. Starbucks and Danaher lagged due to rising coffee futures costs and weakness in the healthcare sector, respectively, as Boeing's recent portfolio addition was weighed down by certification delays.
