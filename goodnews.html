          <p>This article discusses the potential interest earnings from depositing $20,000 into a 2-year or 1-year CD account. With online banks offering rates over 4%, savers could earn significant interest, but they need to keep the money untouched for the entire term to avoid penalties. A 2-year CD at 4.40% could yield $1,798.72, while a 1-year CD at the same rate could yield $880.00. The article suggests that with expected interest rate cuts, savers should act proactively to secure high rates now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague concluded with a commitment from allies to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP within a decade, marking a significant rise from the current 2% guideline. The agreement stipulates that 3.5% of the spending must be allocated to core defense, while the remaining 1.5% can be used for defense-related expenditures like infrastructure and cyber security. Despite concerns about Donald Trump's past comments on collective defense, the summit reaffirmed NATO's commitment to Article Five. The summit also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with leaders pledging continued support, although a specific condemnation of Russia was absent from the final statement.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is poised to become the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor after leading in the city's ranked-choice primary. Mamdani, a state assemblymember, gained traction through in-person interactions, viral videos, and progressive policy proposals. If elected, Mamdani would be New York City's first Muslim mayor and youngest in over a century. His legislative priorities include affordable housing, free public buses, and raising taxes on big corporations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of new single-family homes dropped 13.7% in May compared to April, reaching 623,000 units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis. This total was 6.3% lower than May 2024 and below both the six-month and one-year averages. Slower sales resulted in a significant increase in supply, with 507,000 new homes for sale at the end of May, representing a 9.8-month supply. Economists attribute the decline to high mortgage rates affecting affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Judge Rules California FAIR Plan's Smoke-Damage Policy Illegal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled that the California FAIR Plan's smoke-damage policy violates state law by providing less coverage than required. The FAIR Plan's policy required "direct physical loss" with "permanent physical changes," making it difficult for homeowners to be compensated for smoke damage. The ruling could have broad implications for the FAIR Plan, which has seen its enrollment skyrocket as insurers pull out of California. The judge stated that the plan could not reject claims based on laboratory testing and had to provide adequate coverage for smoke damage.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly in advanced talks with Brentford to acquire midfielder Christian Norgaard due to uncertainty surrounding Thomas Partey's future. The Emirates Stadium club is exploring a deal worth around £10 million, with potential performance-related add-ons of £5 million. Sevilla's Lucien Agoume is also on Arsenal's list, but Mikel Arteta prefers Norgaard because he is a Premier League-ready player. Discussions have accelerated, and Norgaard is reportedly keen to join Arteta's side.</p>
