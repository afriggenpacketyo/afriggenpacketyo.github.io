          <p>This article provides an overview of current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting the potential for earning higher returns compared to standard savings accounts.

The article distinguishes between national average rates and those offered by online banks, which often provide more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. It also advises considering short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve has led to higher interest rates for shorter terms, and suggests a CD laddering strategy for long-term savings.

China's Ministry of Commerce is willing to establish a "green channel" for EU export license applications and has granted licenses to suppliers of U.S. auto giants. These measures are a response to President Trump's tariff increases, with some affected rare earth elements being critical for both combustion engines and electric vehicles.

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for selling all their possessions to invest in Bitcoin, has overhauled its security measures following a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives. The family now uses a hybrid analog-digital system, splitting their 24-word Bitcoin seed phrase into four sets of six words, stored in different geographic locations. Some fragments are encrypted and stored digitally, while others are etched onto steel plates and hidden physically across four continents. This decentralized system aims to protect their crypto holdings, even in the event of a physical threat.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf described a dispute over a social media post regarding a burka ban as a "storm in a teacup." Yusuf had criticized MP Sarah Pochin's call for a burka ban, later resigning as chairman before returning to work for the party in a different role. He expressed regret over the post, citing exhaustion as a factor, and clarified his views on banning face coverings in public. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage acknowledged the party had "hit a speed bump" but forgave Yusuf for the incident.</p>

          <h2>Glastonbury Festival Reduces Capacity to Mitigate Overcrowding</h2>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival has reduced its ticket sales by a few thousand this year in an effort to alleviate overcrowding, according to organizer Emily Eavis. Despite being sold out, the festival will not utilize its full 210,000 capacity. Eavis hopes this reduction will improve the overall experience and dynamics on site. Additionally, the Other Stage will have more audience space, and the Shangri-La nightlife area will be expanded due to the purchase of extra land. Organizers are also encouraging festival-goers to use different routes and explore the entire site to ease congestion.</p>
