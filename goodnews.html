          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend approximately $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing President Trump's push for domestic manufacturing without committing to final iPhone assembly in the country. The investment focuses on expanding partnerships with existing U.S. suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components, and includes an exemption for Apple from new tariffs on chips. This strategic announcement boosted Apple's stock and temporarily satisfied the administration's demands, highlighting the delicate balance between political pressure and global supply chain realities.</p>

Italian chefs and food lovers criticized the recipe for misrepresenting the traditional dish, which consists of only three ingredients: spaghetti, pecorino cheese, and black pepper, arguing that altering it fundamentally changes its identity.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their lawsuit challenging the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives to proceed. The court determined that the Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is not above the law and its decisions can be reviewed by courts, overturning a lower court's deferential ruling. The environmental groups argue that the CPUC's 2022 decision to slash credits for solar panel owners violates state law and undermines California's clean energy goals, a case that will now return to the appeals court.</p>

          <p>The new sequel, "Freakier Friday," brings back Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis for another body-swapping adventure, this time involving their respective daughter and granddaughter. The review notes that while the chemistry between the original stars remains the film's biggest charm, the plot feels hasty and underdeveloped, failing to give its new characters much depth. The film serves as a pleasant reunion for fans of the 2003 movie but ultimately feels more like a vehicle for cameos and light hijinks than a story with significant emotional insight.</p>
