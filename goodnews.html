          <p>Stock futures rose as investors expressed optimism that the ceasefire between Iran and Israel would hold. S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite futures all saw gains, reflecting a shift away from geopolitical concerns. International markets also experienced increases, with Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Britain's FTSE 100 all climbing. Oil prices decreased as tensions eased, with U.S. benchmark crude and Brent crude both falling, although prices had initially spiked after the conflict began. Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's appearance before Congress for his semiannual testimony, where he is expected to discuss monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell as President Trump demanded that both Iran and Israel adhere to the ceasefire agreement, accusing them of violations. Brent crude and U.S. crude oil both experienced declines, reversing gains made earlier in June due to the conflict. The easing of tensions reduced concerns about supply disruptions, particularly the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Analysts at Barclays noted that oil prices came under pressure as the threat of a wider regional conflict did not materialize, despite U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites (not investment advice).</p>

Huang Yiping, dean of Peking University‚Äôs National School of Development, suggests that current circumstances may warrant a different approach to fiscal discipline. The call for a proactive policy comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions, including clashes between Israel and Iran, which have raised concerns about global economic stability.

          <p>California's groundwater supplies received a boost after a year of average precipitation, with aquifers gaining an estimated 2.2 million acre-feet of water. Local agencies reported that managed aquifer recharge projects contributed significantly to this replenishment, capturing stormwater and directing it underground. While the amount of groundwater replenishment was less than the previous year's extremely wet conditions, it still represents a positive step in addressing chronic overpumping in farming areas. Governor Newsom reiterated his support for modernizing the state's water infrastructure, including the proposed Delta Conveyance Project, while also highlighting the success of programs like LandFlex in promoting groundwater conservation.</p>

          <p>Two European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a conservation charity near Exeter, prompting an evacuation of the wildlife park. The bears made their way to the honey store and consumed a week's worth of honey before being secured. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, was deployed, and police were notified. Mish eventually returned to the enclosure on her own, while Lucy was lured back with a bell and her favorite foods, as the trust has now launched an investigation into how the breach occurred.</p>

          <p>Republican senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a major bill that would set the rules for digital assets. The framework defines when crypto is a commodity or a security, allows crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and reduces the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies. The proposed bill would also include measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the forthcoming bill.</p>

          <h2>Powell Highlights Fed's Commitment to Curbing Inflation</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's commitment to keeping inflation in check, saying policymakers are expected to stay on hold until they have a better understanding of the impact of tariffs on prices. Powell characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market to be near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. The cautious tones from Powell come despite criticism from President Trump, who has urged Congress to influence Powell (not investment advice). Powell will present his comments to congressional committees this week.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reassured allies of the U.S.'s and President Trump's total commitment to NATO, despite concerns over defense spending. Members agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. Rutte urged European allies to focus on defense investment plans and support for Ukraine, rather than worrying about the U.S. Spain has balked at the 5% spending target, while other members, such as Poland and Estonia, have exceeded the 2% target.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, following a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. The president aimed to secure a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense, which the alliance had already agreed to. Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. The summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, and Trump plans to meet separately with several world leaders.</p>
