          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was temporarily suspended due to thunder in the area. The delay affected scheduled tee times, impacting players such as Max Greyserman, Sam Burns, Rory McIlroy, and Xander Schauffele. The weather interruption occurred during a pivotal stage of the tournament, causing adjustments to the competition's timeline and potentially influencing player strategies as they return to the course after the delay. The PGA officials are monitoring the weather conditions closely to ensure the safety of the players and spectators, and they will announce a revised schedule as soon as it is feasible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decrease in drug overdose deaths, with provisional data showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest year-on-year decline in 45 years. This improvement is attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, policies implemented during the pandemic like telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement funds. While deaths from synthetic opioids are falling, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat to continued progress. The article emphasizes that continued effort can reverse the course of the public health crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering significant policy changes to increase access to in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.) for Americans, including requiring insurers to cover the procedure, extending coverage to those insured through the Affordable Care Act, and pushing Congress to pass a law mandating private insurance companies to cover I.V.F. costs. White House officials have been meeting with fertility industry leaders and conservative policy experts to discuss these proposals, with a report expected soon. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has expressed disappointment at not being included in these discussions.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto, now playing for the New York Mets after signing a 15-year, $765 million contract, faced a hostile reception from Yankee fans during his return to Yankee Stadium. Despite his previous popularity as a Yankee player, fans booed him at every at-bat, with some altering their old Soto jerseys in protest. The game marked the start of a Subway Series, with both teams holding first place in their respective divisions. The Yankees ultimately won the game 6-2, overpowering the Mets' pitching, though Soto had a decent day with three walks, a stolen base, and a run scored.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the European Union, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The proposal aims to restore opportunities lost after Brexit, similar to existing agreements with countries like Australia. While Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the scheme as "free movement through the back door," Starmer insists it is a reciprocal arrangement and not a return to pre-Brexit freedoms.

          <p>Chinese scientists have made advancements in plasma excitation technology that can significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones, potentially doubling their flight efficiency. Wind tunnel tests revealed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could boost a drone wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88%. This technology could extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance drones, enabling them to fly for extended periods. The research was conducted by a team from the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, experienced years of unexplained calf pain before finally being diagnosed with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed. After an unsuccessful bypass surgery, Prindle sought treatment from Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic, who performed a surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles. The surgeries corrected Prindle's legs and have allowed her to return to a semblance of a normal life, and she hopes her story inspires others to push for answers when they know something is wrong.</p>
