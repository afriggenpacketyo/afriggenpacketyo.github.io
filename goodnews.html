          <p>The Detroit Lions secured a thrilling 38-30 victory over the Baltimore Ravens in a high-scoring Monday night NFL game, moving their record to 2-1. Detroit's offense was potent, rushing for 225 yards, with David Montgomery contributing 151 yards and two touchdowns, including a game-sealing 31-yard run. The Lions' defense also played a crucial role, sacking Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times and forcing a key fumble late in the fourth quarter. This intense matchup, featuring two explosive offenses, saw both teams trade scores throughout, with Detroit ultimately pulling ahead in the final quarter. Quarterback Jared Goff completed 20 of 28 passes for 202 yards, while Amon-Ra St. Brown led receivers with 77 yards. The Ravens' late touchdown proved insufficient to overcome the Lions' dominant second-half performance, securing a significant road win.</p>

          <p>China has begun drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will define the nation's high-level policy priorities and development trajectory for the coming period. These expansive documents have historically guided China's growth for over seven decades, reflecting Beijing's strategic vision for economic and social progress. The upcoming iteration is expected to inform and reflect key policy shifts, especially in light of the significant economic changes since the reform era. Analysts are closely examining what to expect from this new plan, as it continues a long-standing tradition of central planning to steer the country's future direction and address evolving challenges. This process is particularly significant as China navigates global economic complexities and seeks to reinforce its long-term strategic goals.</p>

          <h2>New ITV Drama 'The Hack' Celebrates Journalists Who Exposed Phone Hacking Scandal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 21:47:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer Jack Thorne praised the "remarkable" journalists who exposed the phone hacking scandal, ahead of ITV's new drama 'The Hack.' The series stars David Tennant as Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter who uncovered the extensive hacking at the News of the World. Thorne, who also penned 'Adolescence,' noted the story reveals a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police, extending beyond just journalistic misconduct. Unlike the 'Mr Bates vs The Post Office' drama, which highlighted journalism's struggle to gain traction, 'The Hack' celebrates journalists holding their own industry accountable. The drama tells the story from two perspectives: Davies' reporting and police detective Dave Cook's investigation into private investigator Daniel Morgan's murder, highlighting the bravery required to expose wrongdoing within one's own sphere.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has unveiled its Megablock, an advanced grid-battery upgrade designed to significantly speed up the deployment of large-scale renewable energy projects. Building on its existing Megapack product, the Megablock integrates four Megapacks around a transformer, with first shipments anticipated in 2026. This system is praised for its ease of installation, requiring only three connections, which drastically reduces the electrical work needed and allows for deploying one gigawatt-hour of storage in just 20 days. Despite recent struggles in its flagship electric vehicle sales, Tesla's energy-storage division, particularly the Megapack, has been a bright spot, powering major projects globally and facilitating the integration of clean energy. This innovation is expected to transform energy infrastructure, supporting a more sustainable future by efficiently storing excess renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Many couples experience a decline in sex drive and intimacy after childbirth, a common issue highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth and medical experts. This can stem from significant physical healing for mothers, including uterine recovery and hormonal shifts like drastic drops in estrogen and progesterone, which can cause vaginal dryness and discomfort. Additionally, both parents may face emotional adjustments to parenthood, impacting their desire for sex. Open communication is crucial, as exemplified by Hagan-Blyth's experience, where discussing feelings with her husband alleviated pressure and improved their relationship. Medical professionals emphasize that the six-week postnatal check is not a definitive timeline for resuming sexual activity, and partners should support each other through these changes.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani announced he would participate in a local ABC town hall, reversing his earlier boycott following Disney's reinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had withdrawn in protest of Kimmel's suspension, which occurred after the FCC chair threatened ABC's broadcast licenses over Kimmel's critical remarks about the Trump administration's reaction to Charlie Kirk's death. Disney stated the suspension was due to "ill-timed and insensitive" comments, but reinstated the show after "thoughtful conversations." Mamdani's return signals a resolution to the free speech debate that had sparked backlash from politicians, media figures, and free-speech organizations against ABC and Disney, highlighting the broader implications for media independence and constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, providing significant relief to the University of California system. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants were suspended with unspecific form letters, likely violating the Administrative Procedure Act. This decision expands an existing class-action lawsuit, which had already reversed tens of millions in grants from other federal agencies. The freeze, citing allegations of campus antisemitism and other issues, had threatened UCLA with layoffs and lab closures, impacting critical cancer and stroke research. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in challenging executive branch actions and protecting scientific funding, offering a crucial lifeline to researchers.</p>

          <p>Disney announced the reinstatement of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to air on Tuesday, nearly a week after its suspension over comments made by Kimmel regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. Disney initially suspended the show, citing "ill-timed and thus insensitive" remarks, after the FCC chairman threatened ABC's broadcast license. Kimmel had criticized the "Maga gang's" reaction to Kirk's murder and mocked President Trump's response. The suspension sparked widespread condemnation from free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and lawmakers, leading to protests and boycott calls. While Disney and Kimmel reached a resolution, some major affiliates like Sinclair and Nexstar have indicated they may continue to preempt the show, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding media freedom and political commentary.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual pannage season, a historic practice dating back to 1079. This tradition involves pigs grazing on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the free-roaming ponies and cattle in the forest. The verderers, who oversee the land, initiated pannage due to a "heavy acorn crop," highlighting its importance for the New Forest's ecology and the well-being of other livestock. While celebrated as a unique form of ecological stewardship that has continued unbroken into modern times, officials remind visitors to maintain a safe distance from the pigs and drive carefully. This is crucial as incidents of pigs being struck by cars have been reported in recent years, underscoring the need for public awareness during this special season.</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced 10 new astronaut candidates, comprising four men and six women, selected from over 8,000 applicants to train for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and eventually Mars. This marks NASA's first astronaut class with more women than men, including pilots, engineers, and medical professionals. Notably, Anna Menon, a former SpaceX private astronaut, joins the corps, with her husband already a NASA astronaut. The new class faces uncertainties due to Trump administration budget cuts and challenges to the Artemis moon program. However, officials expressed confidence in beating China back to the Moon, despite Mars missions being further off.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, part of a broader push by major health agencies to phase out live animal research. This initiative, driven by an unlikely coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan lawmakers, seeks to reduce the estimated $20 billion annual federal spending on animal experiments. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the charge, advocating for alternatives like AI modeling and human organ lab testing. While animal tests have been crucial for developing life-saving drugs and vaccines, experts caution that current alternatives are not yet ready to fully replace them, raising concerns for patients with rare diseases who rely on ongoing research.</p>

          <p>India is investing $18.2 billion through its "Semiconductor Mission" to become a global chip major, aiming for a full supply chain from design to fabrication on Indian soil. This initiative, spurred by global semiconductor self-reliance efforts following US restrictions on China, seeks to reduce import dependence and capture a larger share of the electronics market. While India boasts engineering talent and has approved 10 projects, experts caution that more than just financial incentives are needed, including improvements in talent, tax, and trade policies. The government has also expanded support for electronic component manufacturing to create local demand, recognizing the long and challenging road ahead in competing with established chip powerhouses.

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is urging the UK government to offer discount visas to US cancer scientists whose research funding has been cut by the Trump administration. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey proposed a fellowship scheme to attract scientists fleeing the US government's "anti-science agenda," particularly after billions were cut from biomedical research grants. This initiative, which aims to position the UK as a world leader in cancer research, comes amidst Davey's strong criticism of President Trump and his allies, including their stance on mRNA vaccines. The proposal seeks to capitalize on a poll indicating that 75% of Nature journal readers are considering leaving the US due to these actions, offering a strategic opportunity for the UK.</p>
