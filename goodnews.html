          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 00:17:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households and businesses in the United Kingdom. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, this move would position Tesla to compete with established UK energy providers, potentially starting next year. The company's existing presence in the UK, with over a quarter-million electric vehicles and numerous home battery storage systems sold, provides a substantial potential customer base. This strategic expansion into the energy market comes as Tesla faces increased competition and a recent decline in its European electric vehicle sales.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has expanded its policy of deporting foreign criminals before their appeals are heard by adding 15 new countries, including Canada, India, and Australia, to the program. This "deport now, appeal later" scheme allows the government to remove foreign nationals whose human rights claims have been denied, with the individuals participating in their appeal hearings remotely via video link. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion aims to prevent offenders from exploiting the immigration system and to fast-track removals. The move is part of a broader government strategy to toughen its stance on foreign offenders and public safety.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks clinched a dramatic 94-91 win against the Seattle Storm, thanks to a decisive driving layup by Dearica Hamby with just 5.6 seconds remaining. The Sparks had to overcome a significant 16-point first-quarter deficit in the intense, playoff-implication matchup. Kelsey Plum was instrumental in the comeback, contributing 20 points, seven assists, and six rebounds, shifting from playmaker to scorer as the game demanded. The victory marks the Sparks' ninth win in their last eleven games, showcasing the young team's resilience and competitive hunger as they strengthen their position in the WNBA standings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning a major revision of road safety laws for England and Wales, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed strategy, expected in the autumn, also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes are being considered following a coroner's report that criticized the UK's "lax" driver licensing system after several deaths were caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government's goal is to reduce road fatalities and injuries through tougher enforcement and new regulations.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Explain the "Music" of Newly Formed Black Holes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, scientists explain that newly formed black holes emit a unique form of "music" as they stabilize. This phenomenon occurs when a new black hole, created from a star's collapse or the merger of other objects, settles into a stable shape dictated by its own immense gravity. The resulting vibrations in spacetime are not audible sound but are a pure, predictable signal based on the black hole's mass and spin. This process strips away any irregularities from its formation, leaving a mathematically perfect object whose gravitational "ringdown" offers a unique signature for astronomers to study.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese government has launched a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (approximately US$501) annually for each child under three years old. This initiative is expected to have a more significant economic impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger percentage of household income. For example, the payment equates to over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. Analysts suggest this could lead to a noticeable boost in consumption and potentially a modest increase in birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a playoff at this year's Masters, demonstrated his nerve by matching Spaun through the first two extra holes before securing the victory with a birdie on the third. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke back, tied for third. For the 45-year-old Rose, the victory was a gratifying return to form against top-tier competition.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England secure jobs, addressing warnings that there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. The plan aims to simplify regulations, allowing NHS trusts to hire staff based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to open. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the goal is to support new professionals from day one. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance that appears to be closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing 7 of 14 passes and rushing seven times for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. In contrast, his competitor Taylor Heinicke looked rusty in his first preseason action. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Lance's decision-making and the value of his game-time experience, suggesting the competition for the role of Justin Herbert's primary backup is becoming more intense.</p>
