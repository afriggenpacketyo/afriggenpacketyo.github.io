        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A framework agreement has been reached for the social media platform TikTok between the U.S. and China, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The commercial terms are reportedly settled, but the deal requires finalization by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are scheduled to meet on Friday. This development comes amid ongoing trade tensions and a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown. The framework may pave the way for U.S.-controlled ownership of the popular app.</p>

          <p>Bank of America has elevated three key executives, signaling a clear succession plan for when CEO Brian Moynihan eventually steps down. Dean Athanasia, who leads retail and commercial banking, and Jim DeMare, head of global markets, were named co-presidents, while CFO Alastair Borthwick was promoted to senior vice president. This move effectively creates a "horse race" among the three respected leaders to become the next head of the nation's second-largest bank. Moynihan, who has been CEO since 2010, has indicated he plans to stay until the end of the decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semi-annual basis, a change that would require SEC approval. In a social media post, he argued this would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, contrasting it with China's long-term business view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency for investors. This proposal aligns more with European reporting standards but faces skepticism from market analysts who value frequent, reliable data (not investment advice).</p>

This marks his first open-market acquisition of Tesla stock since 2020 and is seen by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future. The purchase comes as Musk seeks greater control and pushes for a new pay package, aiming to transform Tesla into a leader in AI and robotics. Despite slumping sales earlier in the year, this significant insider buy has bolstered investor optimism (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching near-record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, some financial experts believe it remains a worthwhile investment. They argue that the precious metal still has room for growth, particularly if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected, which would make gold a more attractive asset. Gold also serves as a low-risk portfolio diversifier and a hedge against the depreciating value of the U.S. dollar, offering stability during economic uncertainty. The article notes that various investment methods, like fractional gold, make it accessible without large amounts of capital (not investment advice).</p>

Instead, successful people often use more engaging and specific questions to bypass boring social scripts and spark better interactions. The article recommends asking about the "highlight" of someone's week or any "exciting" projects they are working on to encourage more thoughtful responses.

          <p>Sushila Karki, a former chief justice, has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister following widespread, violent protests that led to the resignation of the previous government. The demonstrations, largely driven by Gen Z youth, were fueled by anger over corruption, economic hardship, and a social media ban. Karki, 73, is known for her integrity and anti-corruption stance, and her appointment is seen as a reflection of society's growing trust in female leadership. Her immediate challenges include restoring normalcy, rebuilding public structures, and conducting fresh elections scheduled for March 2026.</p>

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are experiencing unexpected changes in their loan servicing companies, causing confusion and potential payment issues. When a loan is transferred, experts advise borrowers to be vigilant, save documentation, and set aside payment funds until the new account is fully active to avoid lost payments. An automatic administrative forbearance is often placed on accounts during the transfer, which should not negatively affect credit scores. Borrowers are encouraged to check their new account details carefully and monitor their credit reports to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI in their application process, career experts caution against over-reliance on these tools. Common pitfalls include AI "hallucinating" or fabricating information to match a job description, leading to resumes with inaccurate details that candidates cannot defend in an interview. AI-generated applications also tend to look generic, lacking the personal touch that helps candidates stand out. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial generation and always proofreading carefully to avoid embarrassing and potentially disqualifying errors.</p>

Hall, positioning himself as an experienced leader, criticizes Mejia for focusing more on "social media theatrics" than on fiscal oversight. The race sets up a classic political battle between an establishment Democrat with numerous endorsements and Mejia, a young leftist who won in 2022 by galvanizing voters with an anti-establishment message. The contest will test whether voter sentiment has shifted since the last election, which was marked by deep distrust in City Hall.</p>
