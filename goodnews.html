          <p>The recent daylight robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves stole nine jewels valued at over $100 million, has unexpectedly become a source of viral internet content. While French authorities continue their investigation, brands, influencers, and even celebrities have capitalized on the event's cinematic quality, creating memes and tongue-in-cheek advertisements. For instance, the German machinery company whose lift was used in the heist posted a cheeky ad about its equipment's speed and silence. This cultural phenomenon highlights a public fascination with non-violent, high-stakes crimes, turning the audacious theft into a widespread topic of online humor and commentary.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign and criticized President Trump's leadership, labeling him a "tyrant." When asked directly about a future presidential bid, she responded "possibly," but clarified it is not her immediate focus. Recent polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited support for another run, with fewer than a third of voters endorsing the idea compared to Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, sometimes called "VOO and chill," may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. With the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index, some strategists argue that investors are overly exposed to a small number of large-cap stocks. As a result, there is renewed interest in other market segments, particularly small-cap stocks, which have recently outperformed the S&P 500. This potential shift indicates that investors are seeking broader exposure beyond the dominant tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that for many people, one of the best financial investments isn't in the stock market but in practical, everyday savings. He argues that picking the right stock is difficult, but saving significant money by buying household consumables like toilet paper and toothpaste in bulk is a guaranteed return. Cuban calculates that saving 40% on $2,000 worth of annual consumables yields $800 in savings, emphasizing this as a smart, accessible money move. He cautions, however, that this strategy is only effective if purchases are made with cash, not by accumulating credit card debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Just one year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, inspiring restoration efforts worldwide. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, native plants are blooming, and wildlife is returning to the revitalized ecosystem. To mark the milestone, a group of Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the full length of the river in more than 100 years. This successful project serves as a powerful model for other Indigenous-led movements working to protect and restore rivers globally.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to redraw congressional districts in favor of Democrats, is being marketed as a way to counteract Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are framing the vote as a chance for Californians to "fight fire with fire" and oppose former President Donald Trump's political influence. The strategy appears to be effective, with recent polls showing strong support for the measure, largely driven by voters' desire to oppose Trump. The initiative aims to create five additional safe Democratic seats to offset gains made by Republicans elsewhere.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs this week, buoyed by cooler-than-expected inflation data and a strong corporate earnings season. The September Consumer Price Index report showed inflation rising less than anticipated, increasing the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, with about 30% of S&P 500 companies having reported, 87% have surpassed earnings expectations, significantly above the historical average. This positive market performance occurred despite ongoing political drama surrounding a government shutdown and trade negotiations, which had minimal impact on investor sentiment.

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, The Octagon is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes and holds a significant place in U.S. history. Completed in 1801, it temporarily served as the executive mansion for President James Madison after the White House was burned in 1814, and it was where he signed the treaty ending the War of 1812. The house, now a museum, is also known for its haunted reputation, with numerous reports of unexplained phenomena over the years, including a supposed encounter by a young Jackie Bouvier. The building is currently undergoing renovations ahead of America's 250th independence celebration.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Omaha to Los Angeles made an abrupt emergency landing just 18 minutes after takeoff due to a suspected security threat that was actually a technical malfunction. ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who was on the flight, recounted how the pilots, unable to communicate with flight attendants due to an open microphone causing static, misinterpreted banging on the cockpit door as an attempted breach. Fearing a hijacking, they declared an emergency, leading to a police response upon landing. The incident was resolved without injury once the communication issue was identified.</p>

          <p>Following the controversial demolition of the White House East Wing, a journalist embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble, uncovering a secretive and scattered disposal process. Some of the soil was transported to East Potomac Golf Links, a public course, reportedly to be used in creating a new hole as part of a potential Trump-led rebranding. However, finding the actual structural debris proved more difficult, with dump sites denying any involvement and workers instructed not to speak to the press. The search highlights how remnants of a public landmark can be quietly removed and repurposed.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or optimizing sleep through technology, has fueled a multi-billion dollar industry offering gadgets from smart mattresses to neurotech headbands. Companies like Eight Sleep, whose $3,000 mattress cover tracks vitals and adjusts temperature, represent the peak of this movement. However, a recent outage caused by an Amazon Web Services failure highlighted the pitfalls of this dependency, leaving users with beds stuck at extreme temperatures or in upright positions. While some technology offers real benefits for sleep disorders, the increasing integration of complex systems into our beds introduces new potential points of failure for a fundamental biological process.</p>

Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is made of a transparent hydrogel material that allows it to closely mimic the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish. Its design features low power consumption and near-silent operation, making it ideal for tasks requiring discretion, including the inspection of underwater structures without disturbing the marine environment.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Seattle-area mansion for $63 million, two years after relocating to Miami with his wife, Lauren Sánchez. Bezos purchased the property in 2019 for $37.5 million, realizing a profit of over $25 million from the sale. This major real estate transaction coincides with Bezos steadily reducing his ownership stake in Amazon, which has fallen below 10% for the first time since the company went public. The sale and stock divestment occur as he and Sánchez remain in a legal dispute with her brother over attorney's fees from a previous defamation lawsuit.</p>

Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as the candidate closer to the party leadership, is viewed as an expression of unease within the party about its current political standing. While the result was not a landslide, it places Powell in a senior, directly elected role. Following the announcement, Powell and Starmer held a meeting, and she has indicated her critiques of the party's direction will primarily be articulated privately.</p>
