          <h2>Reform UK Gains Ground in Local Elections While Labour Holds Key Mayoralties</h2>

          <p>Reform UK made significant gains in recent local elections, securing its first Parliamentary by-election victory in Runcorn and Helsby and winning mayoral contests in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull & East Yorkshire. Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, though their vote share decreased in these races, with Reform UK emerging as a close second. The Conservatives experienced substantial losses, while the Liberal Democrats increased their overall number of seats and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire councils. These election results reflect a shift in the political landscape, with Reform UK gaining traction and challenging the dominance of traditional parties.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett and the city of Chicago have reached a settlement agreement after Smollett's conviction for staging a hate crime was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Smollett, who had reported a racist and homophobic attack in 2019, was convicted in 2021 but the conviction was overturned based on due process violations. The Illinois Supreme Court decided that the special prosecutor's decision to retry Smollett on charges violated his rights. Details of the settlement have not been disclosed, and the parties are scheduled to meet in court again on May 29.</p>

The report comes amid uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs, with economists suggesting that the effects may not be immediately visible.

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 index has achieved a record-breaking winning streak, rising for fifteen consecutive days, while global markets face turbulence due to U.S. tariff policies. Analysts attribute the rise to the UK's neutral trade status, defensive giants drawing investors, and robust corporate results. The FTSE 100's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain in favor, although risks such as geopolitical hotspots and a firmer pound could impact momentum. However, undervaluation relative to the FTSE 100's global peers combined with expectations of multiple interest rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, could push the index as high as 8,900 points by the end of next month.</p>
