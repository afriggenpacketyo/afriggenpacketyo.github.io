          <p>Divers and archaeologists have recovered significant ruins and relics from a 2,000-year-old city submerged in Abu Qir Bay, near Alexandria, Egypt. The artifacts, which date from the Ptolemaic to the Roman eras, include pottery, statues, and ancient port structures. Officials believe the site was an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, known in antiquity as a center for religious festivals and entertainment. The discovery provides new insights into the region's prosperity and highlights how natural events like earthquakes have shaped history by submerging once-thriving urban centers.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, fashion experts are celebrating Giorgio Armani not just for his design genius but for his revolutionary business strategies that built a global empire. Armani was praised for maintaining creative control over his brand by never selling or merging his company, ensuring a consistent and classy vision across all product lines, from haute couture to accessible luxury. He famously redefined professional attire with the deconstructed power suit for both men and women and pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements on the red carpet. His legacy is one of sophisticated design and masterful brand management.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that an accountancy administrator was unfairly dismissed for spending less than an hour of her workday on personal online browsing. The judge awarded the employee over £14,000, stating that her personal computer use was not excessive and that the company had no clear policy prohibiting it. The ruling noted that the business owner also used her computer for personal matters. The judge concluded the dismissal was likely motivated by a desire to remove the employee before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger unfair dismissal protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed legislation that increases the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. The original $10,000 cap was implemented as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significantly impacting taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. Proponents of the higher cap, which was a bipartisan effort, argue it alleviates a form of double taxation. However, analyses from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Foundation project the change will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Broadcom surged after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and provided a significantly improved revenue forecast for its artificial intelligence sector in fiscal year 2026. CEO Hock Tan announced that Broadcom has secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips, widely believed to be OpenAI, with over $10 billion in new orders. This unexpected development suggests that Wall Street's previous earnings estimates were too low, making the stock appear cheaper on a forward-looking basis despite its record-high price. The positive outlook is further bolstered by Tan's agreement to remain CEO through at least 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell by 16 basis points to 6.29%, marking its largest one-day drop since August 2024 and reaching its lowest point since October. The sharp decline was a direct reaction to the weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which has increased expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This significant drop in borrowing costs could provide some relief to potential homebuyers who have been sidelined by high home prices and months of rates hovering near 7%. However, it remains uncertain if this will be enough to reinvigorate a housing market that has been struggling with affordability issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced it has seized more than 40,000 pounds of cocaine and apprehended 36 suspected smugglers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past month. The seizures are part of Operation Pacific Viper, a heightened effort to disrupt drug trafficking routes from South America before they reach U.S. shores. The operation involves coordination with international partners using cutters, aircraft, and tactical teams. This success follows a recent record-breaking offload in Florida, highlighting the scale of counter-narcotics operations being conducted in both the Pacific and the Caribbean.</p>
