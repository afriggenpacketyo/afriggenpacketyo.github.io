          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced on social media that he convinced Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. Trump, a known fan of Diet Coke, praised the alleged decision as a positive move for the company. In response, Coca-Cola acknowledged Trump's enthusiasm and stated that more details about new product innovations would be shared soon, without explicitly confirming the switch. The company currently uses cane sugar in products sold in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>The U.K. and Germany are set to sign a new agreement to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel, with Germany committing to tighten its laws by the end of the year. The new legislation will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to the U.K., a post-Brexit loophole that previously existed. This move aims to disrupt the supply chain for small boats used in dangerous Channel crossings by allowing German authorities to investigate and act against smugglers' storage facilities.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured the initial stages of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using data from the Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory, scientists identified the mineral silicon monoxide, a key building block of planets that forms at very high temperatures near a protostar. This discovery provides a direct glimpse into a process similar to how our own solar system may have formed, offering new insights into the dawn of planetary creation.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has released an optimistic forecast for the remainder of 2025, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that "the world is less uncertain today" than it was at the start of the year. Despite beating second-quarter earnings estimates, the airline's revenue fell slightly short of expectations, reflecting weaker domestic demand and pricing power. The carrier now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year, a more confident outlook than its previous dual-scenario forecast that accounted for a potential recessionary environment.

          <p>A groundbreaking study has confirmed that an experimental technique using DNA from three people can successfully prevent devastating inherited disorders. British researchers used the method, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children who are now free from the rare but often fatal mitochondrial diseases that plagued their families for generations. The procedure involves transferring nuclear DNA from the parents' fertilized egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, creating a baby with genetic material from three individuals.</p>
