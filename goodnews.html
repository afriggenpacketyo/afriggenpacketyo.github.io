          <p>First Lady Melania Trump is carving out a focused and influential role in her husband's second term, concentrating on the intersection of technology, artificial intelligence, and child welfare. In a rare public appearance, she spoke about the need to prepare children for an AI-driven future, building on her previous "Be Best" initiative. Despite maintaining a relatively private profile, she has been instrumental in legislative efforts, such as the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. This targeted approach demonstrates a shift towards substantive policy engagement on select issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are advised to carefully evaluate several key questions before taking out a home equity loan, especially with a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut on the horizon. The article suggests assessing the actual amount of equity available, determining the urgency of financial needs, and weighing the benefits of borrowing now versus waiting for potentially lower rates. It also contrasts fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate HELOCs, urging borrowers to consider their tolerance for future rate volatility. Making an informed decision is crucial to avoid the risk of foreclosure if repayment becomes unmanageable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles' highly effective and controversial short-yardage play, known as the "tush push" or "brotherly shove," is set to return for the upcoming NFL season. The play, which involves teammates pushing quarterback Jalen Hurts forward, survived a proposed ban during an offseason vote by NFL owners. Opponents have raised concerns about fairness and safety, but the league found no evidence of increased injury risk associated with the tactic. The Eagles have defended the play as a skillful execution that any team is free to attempt, setting the stage for its continued use in their season opener.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of stablecoins, digital assets pegged to traditional currencies, presents a significant challenge for Beijing, as over 99% of them are backed by the U.S. dollar. This dominance reinforces the dollar's global financial power, a trend that runs counter to China's efforts to promote the yuan and reduce reliance on its economic rival. While stablecoins offer the efficiency of digital currency, their overwhelming link to the dollar creates a strategic dilemma for Chinese policymakers. They must now consider how to respond to this emerging financial technology that could further entrench American influence in the digital economy.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut widely expected in September, savers with significant funds like $10,000 are encouraged to secure high-yield Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts soon. The article suggests that banks may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision, making the current high-rate environment a limited-time opportunity. It advises savers to consider depositing more if possible to maximize returns, shop directly with online banks that typically offer better rates, and not to delay their decision. Acting promptly can help lock in favorable returns before they potentially decline for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has stepped down from his role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. His tenure was marked by significant off-field achievements, including the construction of a new £1 billion stadium, but also by consistent criticism from fans over a lack of on-field success, with only two major trophies won. The club's ownership reportedly decided a change was needed to pursue greater sporting success, leading to his immediate departure. Peter Charrington will take on the new role of non-executive chairman as the club enters a new era of leadership.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have seen a gradual but steady decline throughout 2025, offering some relief to prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped by more than half a percentage point since the beginning of the year, signaling a positive trend for affordability. Further decreases are possible, contingent on the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decisions and the performance of the 10-year Treasury yield. While rates are not at the historic lows of a few years ago, their downward trajectory provides a reason for cautious optimism in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California privacy laws by improperly tracking the activity of millions of smartphone users.

While the damages awarded were far less than the $30 billion sought by the plaintiffs, the verdict was hailed as a victory for consumer privacy.

          <p>This analysis of Daniel Levy's 24-year tenure as Tottenham's chairman concludes his legacy will be a complex one, marked by a stark contrast between business success and sporting frustration. He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, most notably building a state-of-the-art stadium and training facility, making Spurs a highly profitable entity. However, this financial acumen was often seen by fans as a lack of on-field ambition, resulting in only two major trophies during his long reign. Ultimately, his time in charge will be remembered for both the world-class facilities he built and the consistent failure to translate that success into silverware.</p>
