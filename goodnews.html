          <p>Oscar Piastri claimed a controlled victory at an eventful Dutch Grand Prix, significantly extending his championship lead. The race was marked by multiple crashes and three safety car periods, creating a chaotic environment for the drivers. Piastri's McLaren teammate, Lando Norris, was on track for a second-place finish but was forced to retire with just seven laps remaining due to an oil leak, a major blow to his title aspirations. The unexpected turn of events allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to take second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar achieved his first-ever podium finish, securing third in a memorable race.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Henry Winkler, recently honored at the Television Academy Hall of Fame, shared that his decades in Hollywood have not altered his fundamental view of the world or his appreciation for family and human connection. Known for iconic roles from the Fonz in "Happy Days" to his recent work, Winkler expressed immense gratitude for his long career and his continued passion for acting. He recounted a harrowing incident from his "Happy Days" era where he helped talk a suicidal teenager off a ledge over the phone. Winkler attributes his longevity and balanced perspective to tenacity, the ability to listen, and a deep sense of gratitude rather than just being a "nice guy."</p>

          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran White House correspondent Mark Knoller, a revered figure known for his meticulous record-keeping of presidential activities across eight administrations. Knoller, who worked at CBS for 32 years, was considered the unofficial historian of the White House, with an encyclopedic knowledge of presidential statistics that even presidents' staffs would consult. Colleagues remembered him not only for his distinctive radio voice and journalistic integrity but also for his generosity and warmth. His obsessive dedication to documenting every presidential speech, trip, and comment made him a unique and indispensable institution in Washington journalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," Dr. Sanjay Gupta highlights a paradigm shift in pain research that prioritizes patients' lived experiences. This approach, known as reverse translational research, begins with real-world patient data and then moves to the lab to decipher the underlying mechanisms, flipping the traditional "bench-to-bedside" model. Dr. Gupta showcases the work of Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar, who used this method to map the unique neural signatures of chronic pain in patients' brains for the first time. This breakthrough has enabled the development of deep brain stimulation techniques that can predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for managing a condition that affects millions.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, at 80 years old, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits, titled "John's Version," after a decades-long battle to regain control of his music. Following the band's breakup, Fogerty lost the rights to the iconic songs he wrote, a painful experience that led him to stop performing them for many years. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he eventually bought back his catalog and recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band. Fogerty reflects on the emotional journey of revisiting classics like "Proud Mary," aiming to recapture the original feeling and energy of the songs that defined an era.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly bolstering NATO's northern flank. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a driver for growth and national security, while his Norwegian counterpart highlighted it as a historic strengthening of defense cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan confesses to his annual gardening problem: an overabundance of cucumbers. He describes his yearly cycle of ambitious spring planting, including a misguided attempt at "succession planting" to ensure a steady harvest, which ultimately leads to a comical surplus. Gaffigan recounts the initial joy of fresh cucumbers, followed by his daughter's popular salad and his own pickling efforts. However, as the harvest continues to multiply, his enthusiasm turns to desperation as he finds himself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of produce, humorously highlighting the pitfalls of amateur farming.</p>

          <p>Neurosurgeon and author Dr. Sanjay Gupta is shedding light on the complexities of chronic pain, emphasizing that its source often lies within the brain itself. He highlights the case of Ed Mowery, a musician who suffered from a rare and excruciating condition for decades until a revolutionary clinical trial offered relief. Researchers at UCSF mapped the pain signals in Mowery's brain and implanted a device that uses deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt these signals before he consciously feels them. This breakthrough demonstrates that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering hope that similar, less invasive approaches can be developed for millions of pain sufferers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building emotional safety is the key to getting children to listen. Instead of focusing on immediate obedience, parents should use phrases that create connection and validate a child's feelings, which calms their nervous system and encourages cooperation. Phrases like "I believe you," "Let's figure this out together," and "I'm on your side" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative. By consistently protecting a child's dignity and assuring them of unconditional support, parents can build a foundation of trust where listening becomes a natural outcome rather than a result of threats or yelling.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal argues that hunting is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to the factory-farmed products common in modern society. The author recounts her journey to becoming a hunter in Montana, emphasizing the deep connection to nature and the gravity of taking an animal's life. She contends that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with license fees and taxes on firearms directly funding wildlife management. The article challenges the reflexive disdain for hunting from the left, suggesting that hunters and vegetarians share common ground in their deep consideration of food ethics and animal welfare.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is highlighting the little-known origins of surfing in the mainland United States, brought there by three Hawaiian princes in 1885. The teenage royals, David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, were attending a military school nearby when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of the traditional Hawaiian royal sport captivated locals and planted the seeds for the surf culture that would later flourish. The story serves as a crucial reminder of the sport's indigenous roots and its introduction to America through an act of cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>As part of its ongoing efforts to reduce plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia is banning single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The iconic plastic fish, a staple in many takeaways, will be prohibited from sale or distribution starting Monday. The government stated that while each container is used for mere seconds, it can persist in the environment for centuries. Although the containers are made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process effectively. This ban is the latest step in the state's broader legislative push against single-use plastics to protect marine life and cut carbon emissions.</p>

If the cocktail's price had tracked inflation, it would cost just over $20 today.
