          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it has continued to arrest undocumented migrants with serious criminal records in Los Angeles amidst protests against mass deportation policies. The agency released details of over 20 individuals apprehended, citing convictions for crimes such as attempted murder, sexual assault, and fentanyl trafficking. A DHS official emphasized that their enforcement actions target the "worst of the worst criminals" to ensure public safety. The arrests occurred as demonstrations against immigration enforcement escalated, with President Trump deploying the National Guard and Marines to the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed, was assessed among nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers noted that while more investigation is needed, specific foods in the diet may contribute to improved well-being, such as the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and the folic acid in vegetables. The findings suggest a potential link between this dietary pattern and mental health, warranting further research for public health applications.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans six weeks ago. Antoine Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, was described by Louisiana's governor as the worst in recent state history. Law enforcement officials are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the final fugitive's arrest. The incident has drawn criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility.</p>

          <p>A popular Japanese snack, the fruit sandwich or "furutsu sando," has made its debut on UK high street supermarket shelves. Retailer M&S launched a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, featuring strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, which quickly became a top seller. This style of sandwich, typically sold in Japanese convenience stores and bakeries, has recently gained global popularity through social media. The article explores the concept of sweet sandwiches, comparing the Japanese trend to other international variations like Vietnam's b치nh m칣 and Portugal's francesinha, and questions the traditional definition of a sandwich.</p>

          <p>Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the real-life sisters and creative forces behind the Bafta-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," discuss the inspirations for their show's second season. The dark comedy follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships, touching on taboo subjects with a sharp, humorous edge. Sadler, the writer, explains that the series is influenced by their own upbringing in an all-woman household and observations of the "bleak" modern dating scene. The duo aims to continue satirizing topical issues while exploring themes of mental health and family dynamics from a distinctly female perspective.</p>

This feature explores the century-old concept of phage therapy as a potential solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance.

This technology will enable researchers to accurately measure the amount of carbon stored in tree trunks and create a global 3D map of forests. The initial images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, offering a vital new tool for monitoring these critical ecosystems and combating climate change.</p>

She then presented the paintings to each student as a gift, an act that was met with amazement and some remorse from her classmates, who wished they had paid more attention to her.

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that the order targeting the firm Susman Godfrey was unconstitutional, echoing previous rulings in similar cases brought by other firms like Perkins Coie and WilmerHale. These executive orders sought to impose punitive measures, such as suspending security clearances, for representing clients or causes opposed by the president.

This bullish prediction aligns with other analysts, such as Julien Bittel of Global Macro Investor, who believes a global race to accumulate Bitcoin by institutions and individuals could drive the market to this valuation over the next decade. The article notes that for this to occur, the current total crypto market cap of approximately $3.26 trillion would need to grow more than 27 times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. This move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to counteract the long-term trend of productions leaving Hollywood for other locations that offer more generous financial incentives. Industry unions and advocates have warned of significant job losses and applauded the expanded funding as a crucial step to bring production back to California. The new tax credit is intended to help the state remain competitive and support its signature industry.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that he is not giving up on Apple, even as the company's stock faces headwinds. He acknowledged current concerns, including steep tariffs on Chinese-made goods, a lack of groundbreaking AI announcements, and ongoing litigation over its App Store. However, Cramer expressed faith in CEO Tim Cook and pointed to Apple's history of rallying after periods of downturn, suggesting past tough times have been great buying opportunities. He argued that when factoring in its earnings growth rate, the stock remains a compelling investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria used his Paris Fashion Week show to make a powerful statement about the treatment of immigrants and deportees. The show opened with models dressed in white, their hands tied, kneeling in a formation reminiscent of images from high-security prisons in El Salvador used to hold some migrants captured in the U.S. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance was intended to address the dehumanization of immigrants. The show received a largely positive reception online, with many praising it as a bold and revolutionary use of fashion for political commentary.</p>

          <h2>NASA to Conduct Low-Altitude Research Flights Over Southern California</h2>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California as part of its Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will fly between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to sample atmospheric gases and measure land and water surfaces. The aircraft will perform peculiar maneuvers, including vertical spirals over urban areas, landfills, and power plants, as well as simulated missed landings at local airports. NASA is informing the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying planes, as they are part of a student research mission.</p>
