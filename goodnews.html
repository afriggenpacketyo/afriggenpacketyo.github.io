          <p>House Republicans are working long hours to pass President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction package. The House Budget Committee convened late Sunday night to advance the bill, following a previous stall. The Rules Committee also scheduled a late-night meeting to prepare the bill for the House floor, with possible debates and votes stretching into the late hours of the week. The article draws a parallel between the current situation on Capitol Hill and Edward Hopper's painting "Nighthawks," highlighting the weary and detached atmosphere as lawmakers push to finalize the legislation.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped nearly 17% in their Hong Kong trading debut.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, the deals required politically difficult concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished position post-Brexit. The agreement with the EU will generate nearly 9 billion pounds in benefits by 2040 but adds only 0.2 percent to Britain's GDP, while the Brexit cost the country 5.5 percent of its GDP. The article points out that Britain had to allow European trawlers to fish in British waters and grant greater access to American agricultural products. </p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, in an effort to boost its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate was trimmed to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders moved to reduce their deposit rates. The PBOC is likely to continue to ease policy, forecasting the lending rates to be lowered by another 40 basis points by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>
