          <h2>Proposed Overhaul of England's Water Industry Aims to Address Failures and Underinvestment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed the most significant reforms since its privatization, including the dissolution of the regulator Ofwat. The 88 recommendations aim to tackle systemic issues like sewage spills and leaking infrastructure, which stem from a long period of underinvestment. While consumers face sharply rising bills to fund a necessary £100 billion upgrade over the next five years, the reforms seek to prevent future investment shortfalls. The proposals focus on ensuring long-term resilience and continuous infrastructure improvement, addressing the consequences of prioritizing low bills over necessary system maintenance for the past two decades.

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners known as the "Battle of Orgreave." The incident, one of the most contentious episodes of the year-long miners' strike, occurred at a coking plant in Rotherham and resulted in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and the subsequent failed prosecutions, which involved allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the decision to finally investigate the long-unanswered questions surrounding the event.</p>

          <h2>US Imports of Chinese Rare-Earth Magnets Skyrocket Following Eased Trade Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:17:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure supplies. This increase follows a preliminary trade agreement where Beijing eased export controls on these critical components, which are vital for technologies like electric vehicles and wind turbines. China dominates an estimated 90% of the global market for these magnets, giving it significant leverage in trade negotiations. The shortages caused by earlier restrictions had disrupted various industries, prompting the U.S. to explore supply chain alternatives, including a new recycling facility partnership between Apple and MP Materials.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from around 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage fresh domestic investment and restore confidence in the nation's economy. The talks are part of the "Made for Germany" initiative, launched to combat the effects of a two-year recession and a bleak economic outlook. After being hit hard by inflation, energy price shocks, and global competition, Germany is looking to the private sector to supplement public spending, such as a new €500 billion infrastructure and climate fund. The meeting aims to secure commitments for new projects to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, as Chinese-led infrastructure projects overcome longstanding logistical hurdles. In Guinea, the massive Simandou iron ore project, jointly developed by Rio Tinto and Chinese firms, is on track to start shipments in November after the completion of essential rail and port facilities. Similarly, a new railway line will connect the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria's Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports over 1,650km away. These developments are crucial for unlocking the mineral wealth of both African nations and securing new resource streams for China's industrial sector.</p>

          <p>A state-of-the-art British F-35B fighter jet, which has been grounded at an airport in Kerala, India, for over five weeks, is now ready to depart. The stealth jet was diverted to the airport on June 14 due to bad weather and subsequently developed a technical snag that local engineers could not fix. The UK Ministry of Defence had to deploy a specialist team of 14 engineers with unique equipment to carry out the repairs. The prolonged stay of the $110 million aircraft sparked curiosity and online jokes, with airport officials now confirming the jet is airworthy and scheduled for departure.</p>

The squad for this midweek game includes numerous players called up as injury cover, with nine Scots in the 23-man team. While the game's relevance to the Test series is limited, it offers players on the fringe, like Farrell and Blair Kinghorn, a chance to push for selection in the upcoming second Test.</p>

His gang is blamed for much of the escalating violence in Ecuador and is linked to the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition represents a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime, enabled by a recent referendum that allows for the extradition of Ecuadorian citizens.</p>

          <p>A new class of weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing significant potential for treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common and often underdiagnosed hormonal disorder, have reported improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, weight management, and hair loss after using these medications. Researchers believe the drugs help by improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn can lower testosterone levels and regulate hormones. While early studies and anecdotal evidence are promising, larger clinical trials are needed, and access remains a challenge due to high costs.</p>
