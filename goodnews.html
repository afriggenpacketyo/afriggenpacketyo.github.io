          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, expecting the 2020 rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, as the government aims to deliver the stockpiled rice quickly to consumers at lower prices. The decision comes amid public frustration over rising rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the landmark decision would kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a golden age of clean energy.

Provisional CDC data shows that fatal overdoses among people under 35 plummeted from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults.
