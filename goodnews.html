          <p>ICE is initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings, targeting those in the U.S. for less than two years, with the goal of expediting deportations. This initiative aims to have immigration cases dropped, placing migrants into expedited removal proceedings, but requires the cooperation of immigration judges. Critics argue this approach will deter migrants from attending hearings and targets those without criminal histories beyond illegal entry. The administration defends the strategy as a reversal of Biden's policies, enforcing existing laws regarding expedited removals, while immigration attorneys express concern that this will target those trying to legally seek citizenship. The optimism score is reflective of the fact that this is a governmental policy and thus there is relative stability. </p>
