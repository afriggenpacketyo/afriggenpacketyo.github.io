          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged nearly 19% following a strong fiscal first-quarter earnings report, which significantly exceeded net income expectations. This robust performance was primarily driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit, propelled by booming artificial intelligence demand, and a continued revival in its core e-commerce business. Despite heavy investments in the competitive "quick commerce" space and a slight revenue miss, investors have reacted positively to Alibaba's strategic focus on AI monetization and its expanding international online shopping unit. The article emphasizes the company's successful navigation of market challenges and its commitment to innovation, resulting in a substantial rally for its U.S.-listed stock this year.

          <p>European stock markets are broadly expected to open higher on Monday, with indices like the FTSE, DAX, CAC 40, and FTSE MIB all showing projected gains, despite a relatively quiet day for economic data releases. This anticipated positive start follows a downturn last Friday, driven by concerns over European and U.S. inflation figures and the evolving expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Concurrently, Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading, influenced by China's August manufacturing data and ongoing diplomatic assessments of India-China relations at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.

          <p>China's RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) unexpectedly expanded to 50.5 in August, marking its fastest growth in five months and surpassing economists' estimates.
