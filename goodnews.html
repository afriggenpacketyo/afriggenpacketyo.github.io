          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a significant victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating the Labour Party by a mere six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, Reform‚Äôs candidate, overturned a substantial Labour majority to win the seat, marking Reform's first parliamentary by-election win. This outcome signals a potential shift in British politics, with Reform emerging as a stronger contender against the major parties, especially with municipal elections occurring simultaneously. The victory highlights voter frustration with the economy and tensions over immigration, issues Reform successfully capitalized on. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Roche has entered a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss, marking Roche's significant move into the competitive obesity drug market. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, offering a different approach from existing GLP-1 drugs. Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability and muscle preservation. This collaboration aims to position petrelintide as a future backbone therapy for weight management, with both companies emphasizing a strong scientific and cultural fit. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>India will incorporate caste details in its next census, a decision with significant socio-economic and political implications.
