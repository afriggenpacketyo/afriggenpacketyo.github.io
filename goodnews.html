          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a trade deal with China is complete, but it awaits final approval from both himself and President Xi Jinping. Trump highlighted that China will supply full magnets and necessary rare earths upfront, while the U.S. will provide agreed-upon concessions, including allowing Chinese students into American colleges and universities. Chinese state media reported an agreement on a trade "framework" reached during talks in London, though specific details were not immediately disclosed. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that this framework requires approval from both leaders, suggesting some concessions were made beyond the negotiating teams' authority.

This agreement is subject to final approval from both Trump and President Xi Jinping and aims to ease tensions after China imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements.

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices rose by 0.1% in May, which was less than anticipated.

Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than expected at 0.1% and 2.8%.

          <p>President Trump declared that a U.S. trade deal with China is done, pending formal sign-off from himself and President Xi Jinping, following negotiations in London. The agreement aims to ease the trade war between the two largest economies, which had intensified recently due to Beijing's cut in rare earth element exports and the U.S.'s threat to revoke visas of Chinese students linked to the Communist Party. Under the deal, China will maintain its 10% tariffs on U.S. goods, while the U.S. will keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports, with the U.S. seeking to resume and increase shipments of rare earths. The deal aims to alleviate trade tensions and promote positive trade relations between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's aggressive remarks against "communist China" at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore may not resonate well in Southeast Asia. Unlike European allies, Asian nations do not view China as an existential threat, given its role as their largest trading partner. Hegseth's assessment of an "imminent" China threat by 2027 contrasts with previous statements from his predecessor, Lloyd Austin. His remarks also raise questions about his understanding of Southeast Asian nations, given his past inability to name a single member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations during a confirmation hearing.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, admitting they "went too far." The feud between Musk and Trump had dissolved a close partnership that allowed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump's second administration. The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which he claimed would undermine DOGE's work and increase the U.S. budget deficit. Trump had previously indicated he would not have a problem speaking with Musk despite the dispute.</p>

          <p>The resurgence of wolves in Europe, after near extinction, has become a divisive issue, particularly in rural communities. Adam Weymouth's book, *Lone Wolf*, explores how the return of this predator has exposed fault lines across Europe, reflecting anxieties about polarized politics, climate change, and shifting demographics. Farmers face challenges such as livestock losses and confusing regulations, leading to illegal killings of wolves and a sense of frustration. The article emphasizes the need for effective conflict-mitigation systems, honest communication, and acknowledging the needs of all stakeholders to achieve sustainable coexistence.</p>

          <p>The US and China concluded talks in London with a new framework aimed at easing recent tensions and resuming negotiations. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described the agreement as "a framework to implement the Geneva consensus," focusing on defusing issues and opening talks on broader topics like tariffs. While neither side provided specifics, the agreement is expected to lead to increased Chinese shipments of rare earth metals in exchange for Washington easing export controls on semiconductors. Market observers suggest the deal may lack substance but prevents further deterioration of relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article reflects on France's cultural association with smoking and the impending ban on outdoor smoking, which the author views as an end of a significant aspect of French identity. The author reminisces about learning to smoke in Paris and the unique quality of time it provided, a "Pause" in life. The article considers smoking as an illustration of existentialism, symbolizing freedom and responsibility. The author questions whether the ban will diminish the enjoyment and savoring of life that smoking once facilitated.</p>
