          <h2>United States and Japan Finalize Major Trade Agreement, Reducing Auto Tariffs to 15%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 23:03:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes setting reciprocal tariffs at 15% and notably lowering duties on Japanese auto exports from 25%. This agreement is expected to boost Japan's economy, where auto exports to the U.S. are a critical sector. Following the announcement, Japanese automaker stocks, including Toyota and Honda, surged dramatically, with some climbing over 10%. The deal also involves a purported $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and aims to open Japanese markets to more American goods, including agricultural products.</p>

          <p>According to the latest Henley Passport Index, Singapore possesses the world's most powerful passport for 2025, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 destinations. Japan and South Korea follow closely in second place, while several European nations dominate the remainder of the top rankings. The index highlights a continued decline for the passports of the United States and the United Kingdom, which have fallen to 10th and 6th place, respectively. This marks a significant shift from their previous top-tier status, with the U.S. now on the verge of dropping out of the top 10 for the first time.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Companies Encouraged to Integrate with ASEAN Economies Amid U.S. Tariff Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 22:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese firms are being advised to deepen their integration within Southeast Asian economies to navigate escalating U.S. trade pressures. The counsel comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods transshipped through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local ASEAN economies, Chinese businesses can better shield themselves from unpredictable tariff policies. This strategy is seen as a long-term solution as the U.S. imposes an average tariff rate of 42% on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>A 250-year-old shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a former Royal Navy warship. The vessel, originally named HMS Hind, served in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. Researchers used a combination of dendrochronology on its oak timbers and archival records to trace its history. The wreck was uncovered by a storm in early 2024, and the local community played a crucial role in recovering the timbers for preservation and study.</p>
