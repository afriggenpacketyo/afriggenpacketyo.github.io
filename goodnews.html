          <p>The eastern United States is currently experiencing a severe heat wave, with many cities facing record-high temperatures due to a climate phenomenon known as a "heat dome." Cities such as New York, Boston, and Baltimore have seen temperatures soar, triggering heat warnings for over 150 million people. Hospitals are reporting an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transportation has been disrupted, with utilities urging customers to conserve power. While the heat is expected to subside somewhat by the weekend, the eastern US will likely see improved conditions over the next few days. </p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov.

The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected on July 15. Potentially complicating matters is the fact that incumbent Democratic Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent in the fall.</p>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy system could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the required power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The study, published in Nature Communications, explores creating a network that leverages regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. The researchers noted that establishing such a system must navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises, but could improve energy efficiency and resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The initiative aims to optimize solar and wind energy deployment on a global scale. </p>

          <p>Liam Delap scored his first goal for Chelsea in their 3-0 Club World Cup win over Esp√©rance, securing their place in the last 16. Enzo Maresca's side managed to keep their cool in humid conditions in Philadelphia. The victory means that Chelsea will now face Benfica after avoiding a tie against Bayern Munich. There was even a late runout for Santos, who appeared to have made a swift impact when his shot was handled and a penalty was awarded, only for the decision to be overturned after a VAR review.</p>

          <h2>Republican Plan to Sell Public Lands Halted</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 22:51:03 EDT</div>

          <p>A controversial Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from a tax and spending bill for violating Senate rules. Senator Mike Lee's plan to sell up to 3.3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land was rejected under the Byrd Rule. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, but Lee indicated he would continue to pursue the proposal. The plan had faced bipartisan backlash and would have made over 16 million acres in California eligible for sale. </p>
