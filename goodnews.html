        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, which affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers, setting a significant precedent for the industry. The resolution of this dispute removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <p>Kristen Saban, daughter of legendary football coach Nick Saban, has firmly denied rumors that her father is considering a return to coaching. Speculation arose after a former player mentioned the possibility and Kristen posted a nostalgic photo, which fans misinterpreted as a hint of a comeback. In a social media post, she clarified that her father is not returning, stating, "You had your time." Saban, who retired after the 2023-24 season, has previously expressed frustration with the new name, image, and likeness (NIL) landscape in college athletics, suggesting it has shifted focus away from player development.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Debt Relief Strategies for High-Income Individuals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:02:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Even individuals earning high salaries can struggle with credit card debt, often due to lifestyle inflation where expenses rise with income. This article outlines several strategies for high earners to manage and eliminate significant debt balances. Options include using a debt consolidation loan to combine multiple high-interest debts into a single, lower-rate payment, which can save thousands in interest. Another approach is leveraging a 0% APR balance transfer credit card to pay down the principal without accruing interest for a promotional period. Other methods discussed involve negotiating directly with creditors for lower rates or engaging a financial advisor for a tailored payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of ether has climbed significantly, reaching its highest point since January, as the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, a major stablecoin bill now awaiting the president's signature. This legislation marks the first significant crypto-focused law in the United States, providing regulatory clarity and boosting investor confidence in the digital asset space. On Thursday, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for ether saw record inflows, surpassing those for bitcoin for the first time. Analysts suggest this momentum could signal a shift in crypto market leadership from bitcoin to ether, which has seen a two-week gain of over 43%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at Queerness and Its Societal Perception Through the Ages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the long and complex history of queerness, tracing its acceptance and persecution across different cultures and eras. It notes that in antiquity, figures like Leonardo da Vinci and the Roman Emperor Hadrian had same-sex relationships, and societies like ancient Greece had accepted forms of pederasty. However, the rise of Christianity led to centuries of stigmatization and severe punishment for non-normative sexualities, often justified by religious texts. The article also highlights the existence of third-gender identities in various cultures and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights, emphasizing that these hard-won achievements require continuous protection against efforts to reverse them.</p>

          <p>Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb are launching a direct-to-patient program for their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, to improve affordability for uninsured and underinsured individuals. Starting in September, eligible patients can buy a 30-day supply for about $346, over 40% below the current list price, through a subscription model. This initiative, called Eliquis 360 Support, aligns with an industry trend toward greater price transparency and comes ahead of a lower Medicare-negotiated price set for 2026. The move is a strategic response to political pressure over high drug costs and aims to defend prescription volume as generic competition approaches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Express reported that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with total card spending up 7% in the second quarter. This growth helps insulate the company from broader concerns about a consumer slowdown. However, a notable weak spot has emerged in travel spending, specifically in economy class domestic airfare, which remained flat compared to last year. While premium cabin and luxury hotel bookings saw strong growth, the stall in lower-cost air travel could be a concern given Amex's extensive airline partnerships. The trend is partly attributed to declining airfare prices, meaning consumers are spending less per ticket.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account in the current economic climate. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return over a set term, protecting savers from future rate drops. Calculations based on current rates show a money market account would earn slightly more over one to five years, assuming rates remain constant. However, given the likelihood of rate changes, the article suggests that the security of a locked-in CD rate may be the safer and ultimately more lucrative option for many savers.

          <p>British author Philippa Langley, known for helping find the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. The conventional narrative holds that their uncle, Richard III, had them murdered to secure the throne. However, after a decade-long investigation called the Missing Princes Project, Langley asserts that both princes survived. Her research uncovered documents she says provide proof of life, challenging the historical account largely shaped by the subsequent Tudor dynasty. This new thesis shifts the burden of proof, arguing detractors must now find evidence the boys died.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the nutritional differences between bison and beef, concluding both can be part of a healthy diet depending on individual health goals. Nutrition experts note that bison is a leaner choice, offering fewer calories, less total and saturated fat, and lower cholesterol than beef, making it beneficial for heart health and weight management. Conversely, beef's higher fat and calorie content can be advantageous for growing children, athletes, or those needing to gain weight. While bison has slightly more protein, beef is often more affordable, accessible, and available in a wider variety of cuts for different cooking styles.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Fall to Pre-Tariff Levels, Michigan Survey Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:30:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that U.S. consumers' fears about future inflation have significantly decreased, with expectations falling to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The July survey showed the one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive some risk, they believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary. The overall consumer sentiment index also rose slightly, indicating a modest improvement in economic confidence despite ongoing price pressures and economic uncertainty.</p>
