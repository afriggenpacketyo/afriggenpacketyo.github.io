          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the acclaimed 2002 film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is currently in development. The announcement was made in Basel, where England's Lionesses are set to play in the Euro 2025 final, highlighting the original movie's influence on women's football. Chadha is aiming for a 2027 release to mark the film's 25th anniversary, considering either a new film or a television series. She expressed a desire to reunite the original cast, including Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, and to explore how much has changed for women in sports while still facing challenges.</p>

          <p>Tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a 'very temporary' spokesperson to help manage the fallout from a recent scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after being filmed in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert, an event that went viral online. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a short video addressing the company's renewed focus on its data workflow automation services. The move is a clear attempt by the New York-based tech firm to steer public conversation away from the embarrassing incident involving its former leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that both Cambodia and Thailand are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly fighting along their shared border. He reported having spoken with the leaders of both nations, expressing optimism for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing territorial dispute. The conflict, centered around the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, has recently escalated, resulting in at least 33 deaths and displacing over 130,000 people. Trump also indicated that future U.S. trade agreements with both Southeast Asian countries would be contingent on the cessation of hostilities and the establishment of peace.</p>

          <p>India mounted a strong defense on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets for no runs, a resilient partnership between KL Rahul (87 not out) and captain Shubman Gill (78 not out) frustrated the English attack. Earlier in the day, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a commanding total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined resistance has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

The nutritionist also praised the availability of healthy ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers (senbei), and numerous brands of green tea.

          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale effort to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped the recall could flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently hold a majority, enabling them to block the agenda of President Lai Ching-te's government. Proponents of the recall had criticized the opposition lawmakers for passing controversial reforms and being overly friendly with China, while the KMT framed the effort as political retaliation that undermined democracy.</p>

          <p>While daily coffee consumption is common for most Americans, experts say the ideal amount varies significantly from person to person. The FDA recommends no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is roughly equivalent to four cups of coffee, a range considered safe by many dietitians. However, some individuals are more sensitive and may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Recent studies have linked moderate coffee intake to health benefits, but heavy consumption can pose risks, especially for those with hypertension. Experts advise people to be mindful of how their body responds and to prioritize meals and water over caffeine.</p>
