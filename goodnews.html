          <p>A Pew Research Center analysis of federal data reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced eventually remarry, with men being slightly more likely to do so than women. The study highlights significant economic benefits for those who remarry, as their median household wealth is comparable to those in their first marriage and substantially higher than that of divorced, single adults. While remarriage often brings renewed clarity and foresight, some experts caution that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among those over 50.</p>

The cabin crew responded quickly to the situation, and the diversion was made to ensure the safety of everyone on board, with no injuries reported among passengers or crew.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the greatest individual postseason performances in baseball history, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani dominated both on the mound and at the plate, striking out 10 batters while pitching into the seventh inning and hitting three powerful home runs. This incredible two-way display secured a four-game sweep of the National League Championship Series for the Dodgers, who now have a chance to become the first team to win back-to-back World Series titles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that the current high tariff rates on Chinese goods are "not sustainable," even as he defended his administration's tough stance on trade. The statement comes as the U.S. and China prepare for a new round of trade negotiations next week, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia. The talks aim to de-escalate the ongoing trade war and find a path forward before a current tariff truce agreement is set to expire in November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate cancer diagnosis by detecting over 50 different types of cancer, many of which currently lack screening programs. The trial, conducted in North America, found that the test successfully identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with more than half of these cases being caught at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, and if results from an ongoing NHS trial are also successful, it could be rolled out more widely.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Morjaria, a 31-year-old from Newport, discovered she had kidney cancer after a seemingly minor accident during a holiday weekend at Butlin's. After being playfully picked up by someone during a game, she felt a "pop" and later went to the hospital suspecting a broken rib. A CT scan revealed no rib damage but uncovered a large, previously undetected cancerous tumor on her kidney, which doctors described as a "miracle" discovery that likely saved her life. Following surgery to remove the kidney, she is now cancer-free.</p>
