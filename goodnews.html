          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that the increasing number of urgent cases on the court's emergency docket is a result of presidential administrations from both parties using executive power to enact policy. Speaking at a judicial conference, he noted that presidents like Obama, Biden, and Trump have increasingly relied on executive orders and regulations, which are frequently and swiftly challenged in court. Kavanaugh also mentioned that the court is now providing more written explanations for its emergency orders than in the past. He described the collegiality among the justices as "very strong."</p>

Despite their strong placement, both drivers faced challenges, as Norris aborted his first fast lap due to an error and Piastri encountered heavy traffic. In contrast, four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull struggled significantly with his car's balance, finishing in 14th place and complaining that the vehicle was undrivable. Verstappen is also under investigation by race stewards for appearing to throw an item from his cockpit while on track.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 12:11:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new reboot of 'The Naked Gun,' starring Liam Neeson, successfully revives the classic slapstick formula, offering a refreshing dose of pure farce in the current movie landscape. Neeson, known for his serious action roles, effectively steps into the shoes of Leslie Nielsen as the deadpan hero Frank Drebin Jr., making the surrounding absurdity even funnier. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the film prioritizes a high joke-per-minute rate over a complex plot, a style largely absent from modern mainstream comedy. The movie's commitment to inane gags provides a much-needed, enjoyable experience for audiences seeking straightforward, laugh-out-loud humor.</p>

          <p>After a one-day weather delay, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched a new four-person crew to the International Space Station from Kennedy Space Center. The Crew-11 mission includes NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. The crew's Dragon capsule is on a fast-track 16-hour journey to dock with the orbiting laboratory. This flight marks a significant milestone for Cardman, who was reassigned to this mission after her previous flight was altered to accommodate the return of Boeing's Starliner astronauts last year.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Effectiveness of Personal Neck Cooling Fans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common, personal neck cooling fans are gaining popularity as a way to find relief, but experts question their true effectiveness. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural cooling process of sweat evaporation. However, in high humidity, this effect is diminished, and the fans only cool a small surface area of the body. While they can make a person feel cooler due to the high concentration of thermal receptors on the face, researchers caution that this might create a false sense of security, potentially leading to overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, have unearthed a pre-Incan tomb over 1,000 years old while excavating trenches for a natural gas network. The tomb contained the remains of an individual from the Chancay culture, found wrapped in a bundle and accompanied by clay vessels and other artifacts. This discovery is not the first for the gas company, Cálidda, which has made over 2,200 archaeological finds during its infrastructure work. The find highlights the rich archaeological heritage of Lima, a city with hundreds of ancient sites located amidst its modern urban landscape.</p>

          <h2>Key Rules to Consider Before Purchasing an Annuity</h2>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities are an appealing option for securing retirement income, but making a smart choice requires understanding key guidelines. Financial experts suggest several rules, such as keeping total annual fees below 1% and not buying a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for it to mature. Another crucial step is to first calculate essential living expenses and ensure they are covered by guaranteed income sources like Social Security before purchasing an annuity. Additionally, it is often recommended to limit your total allocation to annuities to no more than 25% of your retirement portfolio to maintain diversification. (not investment advice)</p>
