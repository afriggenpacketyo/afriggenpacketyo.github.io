          <h2>SEC Voluntarily Dismisses Lawsuit Against Binance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 17:59:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal is seen as a symbolic conclusion to an aggressive crypto crackdown in the U.S., especially with the Trump administration showing support for the industry, such as the Justice Department shutting down its crypto enforcement team and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission set to be led by a venture capitalist with close ties to crypto. The SEC's motion was granted with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be revived, which is unlikely given the current administration's stance. Optimism score cannot be derived from this article.

          <p>During a recent New York Yankees game, a fan wearing an Aaron Judge jersey ran onto the field in the bottom of the seventh inning, managing to evade security before being apprehended. The fan recorded the escapade on his phone, sprinting from center to right field and even juking a security guard in front of right fielder Cody Bellinger. After briefly rejoining the stands, security officials escorted him off the field in handcuffs. The Yankees won the game 1-0, marking their 16th victory in the last 20 games, further solidifying their lead in the American League East. The article reflects on the Yankees' pitching staff and recent success. The score of the game is a key part of this article's summary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains tariffs, which are taxes on goods bought from other countries, and their impact on the U.S. economy under President Trump. Trump argues tariffs will boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit, while critics contend they will raise prices for U.S. consumers. The article details tariffs imposed on the European Union, China, and the UK, including recent agreements for reductions and exemptions. The piece also touches on the legal challenges to Trump's tariffs, with a U.S. trade court initially blocking the sweeping import taxes before an appeals court allowed them to stay in place while the case is litigated.

          <p>Luke Humphries secured victory against Luke Littler in the Premier League Darts final, claiming the ¬£275,000 prize. Despite Littler's strong start with a 3-0 lead, Humphries rallied to level the score and ultimately dominate after the break, winning with a double 10 finish. Littler, despite a higher average score of 100.29 to 97.86, struggled with his accuracy on doubles, converting only 29.6% of his attempts. Both players are set to team up for England at the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in June, putting their rivalry on hold.
