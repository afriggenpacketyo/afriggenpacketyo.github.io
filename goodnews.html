        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has unveiled a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing an earlier image that drew comparisons to a mugshot. In the new portrait, Trump looks directly into the camera with a serious expression, wearing a blue suit and red tie against a dark backdrop. This contrasts with the previous portrait, which had unusual lighting and was likened to his Fulton County Jail mugshot. A White House official stated that the initial portrait was always intended as a placeholder, and this new portrait represents the optimism and resolve of America following the Biden administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dollar General's shares surged nearly 16% after raising its outlook, indicating it is attracting more middle- and higher-income shoppers amid fears that higher tariffs would negatively impact consumer spending. The retailer beat quarterly expectations for revenue and earnings, anticipating net sales to grow about 3.7% to 4.7%. The company has worked to reduce its exposure to China, limit price hikes, cut costs, and moved manufacturing to other countries. The retailer's success is partly attributed to its ability to offer deep discounts, attracting customers across multiple income bands seeking value. (not investment advice)</p>

The jury found the Shores Inn liable for exposing Alvaro Gutierrez and Ramiro Sanchez to painful and disgusting bed bug infestations, resulting in physical, emotional, and mental anguish. The complaint alleged that the hotel management was aware of the bed bug problem due to online reviews but failed to eradicate the pests, leading to the significant payout.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after 28 years following a judge's decision, having been framed for murder by disgraced Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara.

McDowell walked into CPD's Grand Central Area Headquarters in July 1997 after being shot, and was then framed as the perpetrator in an unrelated murder when he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect in the shooting.</p>

          <p>The CDC is urging continued surveillance of norovirus strains, as the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this stomach bug. Last year's season started in October, driven by GII.17, which has now displaced the previously dominant GII.4 strain. Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance, raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.</p>

Samples of his DNA were analyzed using investigative genetic genealogy, uncovering connections to an 18th-century couple from Bristol, England, and verifying his identity with a comparison sample from his son.</p>
