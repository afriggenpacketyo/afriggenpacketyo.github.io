          <p>McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri secured the top two spots in Friday's practice sessions for the Hungarian Grand Prix. Norris set the fastest time, finishing 0.291 seconds ahead of his teammate, despite both drivers experiencing imperfect laps due to a mistake and heavy traffic. In contrast, Red Bull's four-time champion Max Verstappen struggled significantly, finishing 14th and describing his car as "undrivable." Verstappen is also under investigation by race stewards for appearing to throw an item from his cockpit while on the track, adding another layer of drama ahead of the race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 revival of "The Naked Gun," directed by Akiva Schaffer, brings back the classic spoof-comedy genre with Liam Neeson in the lead role of Frank Drebin Jr. This article praises the film for its commitment to high-volume, absurd gags, a style largely absent from modern cinema. Neeson, known for his stone-faced action roles, is a natural successor to Leslie Nielsen, playing the bumbling detective with a straight face amidst the chaos. The review suggests that in an era dominated by action blockbusters, this unabashedly silly farce offers a refreshing and much-needed comedic experience for theater audiences.</p>

          <p>Investment firm Loop Capital has reiterated its "Buy" rating for Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and increased its price target, citing expectations of another strong earnings report. The firm's analysis suggests Palantir will likely exceed revenue guidance, driven by its leadership in AI and expanding commercial contracts. Palantir's established role in the U.S. government, particularly with the Trump administration's focus on modernizing federal operations, is also seen as a key growth factor. Despite the stock's significant year-to-date rise, Loop Capital believes the company's unique position at the intersection of AI and enterprise software supports its high valuation.

          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched a new four-person crew to the International Space Station from Florida, a day after the initial attempt was scrubbed due to weather. The Crew-11 mission includes NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. The launch marks a long-awaited flight for Cardman, who was previously bumped from a mission to accommodate the return of astronauts from Boeing's troubled Starliner spacecraft. The crew is expected to spend approximately six months aboard the orbiting laboratory conducting research.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign striker Alexander Isak appears to have stalled after Newcastle United rejected an opening bid of £110 million. Newcastle values the 25-year-old Swedish international at around £150 million and has maintained he is not for sale. While Isak is reportedly interested in a move, Liverpool is now considering the deal unachievable this summer and is prepared to walk away. The news comes amid a significant summer spending spree by the Premier League champions, who have already invested heavily in several other players to bolster their squad.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the modern tendency to dabble in many hobbies without committing to any, a habit fueled by a desire for instant gratification. While experimenting with new activities brings joy, the author notes a sense of regret for not developing a more sustained practice outside of work. The piece highlights that hobbies, particularly physical ones like gardening or tennis, can foster focus and mindfulness by emphasizing the process over the result. Ultimately, the article champions the deeply human and enriching decision to pursue an activity simply for one's own enjoyment and personal growth.</p>

          <p>150 years after his death, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen remains one of the world's most beloved storytellers, with his works translated into over 150 languages. Born into poverty, Andersen's tales like "The Little Mermaid" and "The Ugly Duckling" often explored themes of social rejection, longing, and transformation. Behind their fantasy veneer, his stories frequently contained subtle social criticism and moral messages that resonate with both children and adults. His timeless narratives, which have inspired countless adaptations including famous Disney films, continue to captivate global audiences by reflecting on universal human emotions and fallibility.</p>

          <h2>Do Personal Neck Cooling Fans Actually Work to Beat the Heat?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 11:39:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer temperatures rise, personal neck cooling fans have become a popular gadget for staying cool, but experts question their effectiveness. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural evaporative cooling process. However, in high humidity, this effect is diminished, and the fans only cool a small surface area of the body. While they can make you feel cooler due to the high concentration of thermal receptors in the neck, physiologists warn they do little to lower core body temperature. This could create a false sense of security, potentially leading to overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to increase social mobility within Whitehall, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This determination will be based on their parents' occupations. The paid summer program provides experience in government, and successful interns will be fast-tracked for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to create a civil service that better reflects the country it serves, though it has drawn criticism from Conservatives who argue for hiring based solely on ability.</p>

          <p>Utility workers installing a natural gas network in Lima, the capital of Peru, have unearthed a pre-Incan tomb estimated to be over 1,000 years old. The tomb contained the remains of one individual from the Chancay culture, found wrapped in a bundle and interred with clay vessels and other artifacts. This discovery is not unusual for Lima, a city with over 400 archaeological sites, where civil projects frequently lead to such finds. The gas company, Cálidda, has reported making over 2,200 similar archaeological discoveries during its two decades of excavation work in the region.</p>

          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, annuities are gaining appeal as a source of guaranteed retirement income, but they come with complexities. This article outlines several key rules for potential buyers, such as keeping total annual fees below 1% and not committing funds to a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for it to mature. It also advises using annuities to first cover essential living expenses and limiting their allocation to no more than 25% of your total retirement portfolio to maintain liquidity and diversification. These guidelines can help retirees avoid common pitfalls and make more informed financial decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
