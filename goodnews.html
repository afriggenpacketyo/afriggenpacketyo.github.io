          <p>C.C. Opanowski shares her story of being attacked by her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, in 1996, detailing the violence she endured and the initial lack of seriousness from local police. Years later, she learned that Doyle murdered Lori Leonard, a young mother he met online. Opanowski testified at Doyle's trial, providing crucial evidence of his violent tendencies and helping to secure his conviction for second-degree murder. She hopes her story encourages others to be vigilant and speak out about potential dangers, trusting their instincts when something feels wrong. Optimism score is based on the fact that the attacker was brought to justice for their crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump indicated he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of key trade talks, though this may still be higher than desired by investors. This reduction from the current 145% tariff could signal a shift in Trump's approach to trade negotiations with China, a major trading partner. The talks in Switzerland are aimed at achieving "stability" and could potentially lead to a more comprehensive trade agreement. The optimism score reflects a potential de-escalation of trade tensions, though uncertainty remains.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump faces pressure to ease his protectionist agenda as trade talks with China loom, with the S&P 500 rallying on investor hopes for reduced tariffs. While a deal with Britain was hailed as a breakthrough, tougher negotiations with China are expected, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to begin discussions with Chinese counterparts in Geneva. The administration is considering concessions that could see tariffs reduced below 60%, although Trump has suggested an 80% tariff. China's shipments to the U.S. have already plunged, underscoring the impact of the trade war. The optimism score is based on potential easing of trade tensions, but the complexity of negotiations remains.</p>
