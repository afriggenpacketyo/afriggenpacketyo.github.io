          <p>‚ÄòJeopardy‚Äô host Ken Jennings shared his skepticism about the current state of artificial intelligence, despite having competed against and lost to IBM's Watson supercomputer in 2011. Jennings acknowledges that current large language models surpass Watson's capabilities, but he finds AI-generated content creatively unfulfilling. He emphasizes the importance of human connection and originality in creative fields, contrasting it with what he perceives as soulless 'AI slop'. He also noted the concerns about AI replacing creatives in Hollywood, which was a prominent issue during the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage‚Äôs Reform U.K. party achieved a significant victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating the Labour Party by six votes, highlighting the growing influence of the anti-immigration party.

The victory underscores voter frustration with the economy and immigration policies, prompting a shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system.

          <p>Roche has entered the competitive obesity drug market with a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand Pharma's petrelintide, a novel amylin analog. This move signifies Roche's ambition to challenge Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the weight loss treatment space. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, offering a different mechanism from the prevalent GLP-1 drugs, and early data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability. The partnership aims to develop petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset, CT-388, with both companies emphasizing the collaborative nature of the agreement.</p>
