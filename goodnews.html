          <p>Dozens of hand-sewn American flags intended for Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK had to be replaced at an estimated cost of £52,800 because the US embassy objected to the shade of red. A government supplier claimed the embassy found the standard red to be incorrect, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This resulted in the new Stars and Stripes having a more vibrant red than the accompanying Union flags. The incident highlights the meticulous preparations and diplomatic sensitivities involved in hosting high-profile state visits, with the supplier speculating that a previously used sample flag may have faded.</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated rematch for the PFL lightweight title is set between champion Usman Nurmagomedov and challenger Paul Hughes in Dubai. Their first fight in January was a dramatic, back-and-forth contest that Nurmagomedov won by unanimous decision, though Hughes pushed the undefeated champion harder than any previous opponent. MMA analyst Dan Hardy has described the upcoming bout as potentially the "biggest fight PFL have ever put on," highlighting Hughes's remarkable confidence and skill. Hardy anticipates Nurmagomedov will adopt a more wrestling-heavy strategy in the rematch after being tested so thoroughly in their initial encounter.</p>

          <p>Paris is experiencing a boom in authentic Chinese restaurants, driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs catering to a younger, more diverse clientele. Establishments like Tonton Mao are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare, offering regional specialties such as northeastern China's seasoned meat skewers, known as kaochuan. These new restaurants emphasize authenticity, often flying in chefs from China and creating immersive decor that reflects specific historical periods. This culinary expansion is reshaping the city's food landscape, introducing Parisians and tourists to a wider array of genuine Chinese flavors and dining experiences.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. The investors state the plan would rebuild the company without requiring taxpayer funding and would halt dividend payments during the turnaround. This development comes after years of financial instability at Thames Water, with the government on standby for a potential temporary nationalization of the utility.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is considering a high-tech strategic partnership with the United States, which is seeking increased Taiwanese investment to bolster its domestic production capacity. Taiwan's lead tariff negotiator, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun, stated that the goal is to create a "Taiwan model" for expanding U.S. production without relocating entire supply chains. This approach would involve industrial investment planning supported by measures like export credit guarantees. The discussions are focused on expanding supply chain cooperation, highlighted by TSMC's $165 billion investment in new chip factories in Arizona, though the bulk of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan.

          <p>Hurricane Imelda struck Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 90 mph before weakening to a Category 1 and moving further into the Atlantic. As of early Thursday, the storm's center was moving away from the island, and it is expected to become an extratropical cyclone later in the day. While a hurricane warning remained in effect, there were no immediate reports of significant damage from the storm. The National Hurricane Center warned that swells generated by Imelda are still likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has finalized a secondary share sale that allowed employees to sell $6.6 billion worth of stock, cementing the company's valuation at a record $500 billion. This transaction makes OpenAI the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. While up to $10.3 billion in shares were authorized for sale, the lower participation is viewed internally as a sign of confidence in the company's future prospects. The deal, which involved investors like Thrive Capital and SoftBank, is part of a growing trend among major startups to use secondary sales to provide liquidity for employees.

          <p>Chinese researchers are training and testing four-legged robotic dogs in lava tube caves in Heilongjiang province to prepare for future lunar exploration. The caves are considered an excellent analogue for the moon's underground environment, which is a key area of interest for establishing potential human bases. The robot dogs are designed to act as "scouts," navigating narrow passages that are inaccessible to human researchers to perform surveying tasks. This research aims to advance the "embodied intelligence" technologies necessary for complex deep-space exploration missions, enhancing China's capabilities for its ambitious lunar program.</p>

To bolster its position, Alibaba recently launched "Amap Street Stars," an AI-powered feature that ranks offline destinations like restaurants and hotels using navigation data and user reviews.

          <p>Major European defense companies, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have welcomed the political push to establish a "drone wall" along the continent's eastern border to counter threats from Russia. The initiative has gained momentum following recent airspace incursions by suspected Russian drones in several NATO member states like Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark. The proposed wall would be a multi-layered network of sensors and countermeasures to detect and neutralize unmanned aerial systems. While defense giants stand ready to contribute, some experts express concern that the project could be slowed by bureaucracy and that it must also account for drones launched from within EU territory.</p>

          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of AI startup Hugging Face, suggests that current generative AI models like ChatGPT are not designed to produce Nobel Prize-level scientific discoveries. He argues that these models are built to predict the most likely next word and often align with user prompts, which is contrary to the contrarian thinking that fuels major breakthroughs. Scientists who achieve revolutionary insights, Wolf notes, often challenge existing consensus with unlikely but true ideas. While AI can serve as a valuable "co-pilot" for researchers by aiding in data analysis and idea generation, he believes a different architectural approach is needed for AI to generate truly novel scientific theories.</p>

The policy, introduced by a previous Conservative government, restricts Universal Credit or child tax credit payments for third or subsequent children born after April 2017. The government is reportedly considering options to amend or replace the cap in the upcoming budget, such as a tapered system. Phillipson, who is also running for Labour's deputy leadership, stated that tackling child poverty is a top priority and that children should not be punished for circumstances beyond their control.</p>
