        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights 16 abandoned locations worldwide that have been repurposed into popular tourist attractions, offering a unique glimpse into the past. Examples include England's Maunsell Sea Forts, Australia's SS Ayrfield Shipwreck with mangroves growing through it, and Italy's Poveglia island, known for its history as a quarantine station and mental hospital. Other notable sites feature Denmark's relocated Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse, China's 'Paris of the East' replica city Tianducheng, and Namibia's diamond-mining ghost town Kolmanskop. These diverse locations demonstrate how historical neglect can evolve into fascinating cultural and natural experiences for visitors.</p>

          <h2>Genetic Genealogy Revolutionizes Cold Case Investigations, Unmasking Serial Criminals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:45:51 EDT</div>

          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney with a biology Ph.D., has pioneered investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that leverages public DNA databases to construct family trees and identify elusive criminals. Her groundbreaking work famously led to the capture of the Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, after more than three decades. Rae-Venter's Firebird Forensics group has since assisted law enforcement nationwide in solving approximately 60 cold cases, including the identification of a sexual assault perpetrator from 1997. While proving invaluable for justice, this powerful forensic tool also sparks ongoing debates and concerns regarding individual privacy and the extensive use of genetic data by authorities.</p>

          <h2>Secret Service Enhances Security Measures Following Last Year's Butler Assassination Attempt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:44:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly bolstered its security protocols and technology. The agency has deployed a new fleet of military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance, aiming to detect and mitigate unauthorized unmanned aircraft systems, a critical failure point in the Butler incident. Additionally, mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to facilitate direct radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement, addressing a key communication breakdown identified in the prior event. These reforms aim to prevent a recurrence of the July 13, 2024, tragedy.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Reduce Electric Vehicle Costs for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:20:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, through Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, has pledged to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers, with announcements expected soon. While Alexander did not confirm specific taxpayer-funded grants, she pointed to existing investments, including a £25 million package for "cross-pavement gullies" to aid charging for homes without driveways, and £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. The initiative aims to boost EV sales, which currently lag behind mandated targets, by addressing the high upfront cost and "range anxiety" that deter many potential buyers. This move is critical as the UK approaches its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent political economist and Beijing policy adviser, asserts that Chinese think tanks must adopt a "self-centered" approach rooted in an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively explain China's practices and anticipate its future. He contends that these organizations should focus on practical, empirical research into Chinese public policies, distinguishing their work from academic institutions that may be overly influenced by Western methodologies. Zheng believes that by deeply understanding and articulating China's unique practical experiences, these think tanks can genuinely enhance the nation's soft power on the global stage and provide unparalleled insights into its development and governance.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies five small, intentional daily habits that significantly contribute to stronger, happier relationships, particularly amidst demanding weekdays. These practices include establishing a "mini morning routine" for shared connection, sending thoughtful check-ins during the day to remind partners they are top of mind, and taking individual time to de-stress and recharge after the workday. Crucially, the happiest couples intentionally carve out a dedicated "us time" each evening, free from distractions and multitasking, and conclude the day with a quiet check-in to ensure emotional alignment and prevent minor issues from escalating. These consistent, small efforts foster deeper intimacy and connection without demanding extensive time commitments.</p>

          <p>A high-resolution sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River unexpectedly led to the accidental discovery of an 1880 shipwreck, believed to be the wooden paddle wheel steamer L.W. Crane. Researchers from the Wisconsin Historical Society's Maritime Preservation Program and the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association were initially mapping known cultural sites when they found the partially buried 90-foot hull. The L.W. Crane, built in 1865 for passenger and freight transport, caught fire and sank in Oshkosh in 1880, directly across from where its remains were found. This exciting discovery adds to the significant amount of debris, including large trees and bridge remnants, found in the surveyed river stretch, with further investigations into other wrecks ongoing.</p>

This innovative method, detailed in the peer-reviewed journal Science Bulletin, demonstrates how captured carbon dioxide can be transformed into food and chemicals, significantly contributing to carbon neutrality. The team successfully adapted their enzyme-based process to produce sucrose and other complex carbohydrates, including fructose and starch, without the need for resource-intensive crops like sugar cane or sugar beets.
