          <p>President Trump has suggested without evidence that former President Joe Biden delayed sharing his prostate cancer diagnosis, claiming it was part of a pattern of concealing the former president's decline.

This NPR article highlights Trump's remarks, which contrasted with his initial compassionate response to Biden's announcement. The article also notes that disclosures of medical information are at the discretion of the White House, and presidents have a history of concealing medical issues.</p>
