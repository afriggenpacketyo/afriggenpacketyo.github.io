          <h2>Understanding Grace Periods for Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the nuances of credit card grace periods, which are often misunderstood by consumers. While most cards offer a grace period on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their balance in full each month, this benefit typically does not extend to late payments. Missing a payment due date can result in immediate consequences such as late fees, penalty APRs, and potential damage to one's credit score if the payment is over 30 days late. The article advises proactive communication with card issuers and exploring debt relief options if consistently struggling to make timely payments.</p>

          <h2>Harvard Study Suggests Family Tendency Towards Having All Boys or All Girls</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:12:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Harvard University suggests that the odds of having a boy or a girl may not be a simple 50/50 chance with each birth. After analyzing over 58,000 women's birthing records, researchers found a pattern of "sex clustering" in families, indicating a potential biological tendency toward one sex. For example, after a family has three boys, the probability of the next child being a boy rises to 61%. The study identified a woman's age at her first birth as a correlating factor, though the precise biological mechanism remains uncertain and requires further research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the increasing prevalence of low-quality, AI-generated content, or "slop," across the internet could inadvertently push people to spend more time offline. As platforms like YouTube and Reddit become inundated with dubious AI posts and interactions on dating apps feel increasingly synthetic, the real world offers a more trustworthy alternative. The author suggests that the degradation of online experiences, from search results to social media, makes activities like reading physical books, shopping at local stores, and engaging in face-to-face conversations more appealing. This shift could represent an unintentional cure for widespread internet addiction.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel, 76, recently spoke about his diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a condition involving fluid buildup in the brain. In a podcast interview, he shared that while the issue is still being addressed, he feels good despite the diagnosis, which he described as sounding worse than his symptoms. Joel noted that the primary effect has been on his balance, likening the sensation to "being on a boat." He canceled his tour in May after the diagnosis but reassured fans not to worry, stating that the condition is treatable and relatively uncommon.</p>

          <p>Imprint, a five-year-old credit card startup, has successfully won a competitive bid to launch a new co-branded card with online shopping platform Rakuten, beating out established banks. This deal marks a significant milestone for the New York-based company, which also recently raised $70 million in new capital, increasing its valuation to $900 million. Imprint partners with smaller banks and uses the American Express network to issue its cards, focusing on a seamless digital experience and better rewards. The company aims to disrupt the lucrative co-branded card industry traditionally dominated by financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.</p>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered new, well-preserved artifacts from the USS DeHaven, a U.S. destroyer sunk during World War II off the Solomon Islands. Using remotely operated vehicles, the Ocean Exploration Trust captured high-resolution footage of the wreckage, identifying intact torpedo warheads, artillery, and the ship's bell. The DeHaven was sunk by Japanese bombers in February 1943, resulting in the loss of 167 crew members. This expedition, part of a larger effort to study the historic maritime site known as Iron Bottom Sound, provides valuable data for historians and heritage resource managers.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that the upcoming August 12 deadline for a trade deal with China is likely to be extended. He expects to finalize the extension during talks with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week, which will be hosted by the Swedish Prime Minister. The original 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs was enacted to allow for negotiations after both nations had imposed steep import duties. Bessent expressed optimism, stating that trade relations with China are in a "very good place" and that he hopes to discuss other issues, including China's manufacturing output and its support for Russia.

          <p>Food giants like General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet rising consumer demand. General Mills generated over $100 million from its protein cereal lines, while Kraft Heinz is rebranding existing products like Lunchables to highlight their protein content. This trend, partly fueled by social media influencers and users of new weight-loss drugs, has also spurred a wave of new startups like David Protein Bars and Protein Pints ice cream. The market for protein-rich foods is expanding rapidly, with companies investing heavily in new product development and marketing to capture this growing segment.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic soft drink made with U.S. cane sugar, set to launch later this year. The move comes shortly after President Donald Trump posted on social media that he had convinced the company to make the switch from high-fructose corn syrup. The company's CEO clarified that this new offering is an "and" strategy, meant to complement its existing portfolio rather than replace it entirely. While proponents claim cane sugar is better, health experts note that excess sugar from any source is detrimental, and the change is unlikely to have a significant nutritional impact.</p>
