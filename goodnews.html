          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after moving abroad, expecting to save £350 million over five years. A new specialist team will utilize travel data to identify claimants residing outside the UK for more than eight weeks, making them ineligible under standard rules. This initiative follows a successful pilot program that stopped £17 million in incorrect payments to 2,600 people. The government plans to expand these efforts to other benefits claimed overseas, aiming to tackle rising benefit overpayments, which reached an estimated £6.5 billion in fraud during 2024/25.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of people across the UK are preparing for significant travel disruption this bank holiday weekend, stemming from a combination of rail strikes, extensive engineering works, and anticipated heavy road traffic. The RMT union's industrial action will lead to major cancellations and alterations on the CrossCountry rail network, with no direct services on Saturday. Network Rail strongly advises all passengers to verify their travel plans before departing. Concurrently, the RAC warns of approximately three million getaway journeys, forecasting particularly severe congestion on routes like the M5. Despite these travel challenges, the weather outlook for central and southern England is largely warm and dry.</p>

          <p>Adidas executives have issued a public apology to the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for culturally appropriating their traditional huarache sandals. The company admitted its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe, designed by Willy Chavarria, closely resembled the community's traditional designs. President Claudia Sheinbaum had previously criticized Adidas, vowing stronger protections against global brands copying Indigenous culture. Adidas stated it would collaborate with the town in the future, acknowledging the community's reliance on handicrafts for their livelihood. This apology was accepted by Oaxaca's Ministry of Culture and Arts as a "historic act of recognition."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively winding down operations at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in Florida's Everglades. The ruling prohibits new detainee transfers and construction, ordering the removal of temporary infrastructure within 60 days due to severe environmental concerns. The judge agreed with environmental groups and a Native American Tribe that the Trump administration and Florida officials violated the National Environmental Policy Act, risking irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem. Florida officials plan to appeal, while advocates celebrate the decision as a victory for Everglades protection.</p>

Honda similarly attributed any price changes to added feature content and product competitiveness, emphasizing its high proportion of American-made vehicles.

This ruling, considered unusual given the rarity of such acquittals in Thailand, eases a significant legal threat that could have resulted in up to 15 years in prison. The charges stemmed from remarks made in a 2015 interview regarding the 2014 coup that ousted his sister. Thaksin's legal team successfully argued his comments were misinterpreted.

          <p>An international study has revealed that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing linalool, a gas that prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This newly discovered mechanism offers crucial insights into how corn adapts to its environment and defends against pests. Researchers found that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth, suggesting complex interactions. Optimizing the release of this gas could potentially lead to improved pest control strategies and increased crop yields, marking a significant advancement in agricultural science and plant communication understanding.</p>

A notable factor was the easing of rice inflation to 90.7% after two months of prices more than doubling.
