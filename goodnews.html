          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, issued a temporary injunction, blocking President Trump's controversial plan to federalize 200 members of the state's National Guard for deployment. The ruling cited the government's failure to demonstrate that ongoing protests outside an ICE facility constituted a "rebellion" warranting such federal intervention. The judge highlighted the Portland Police Bureau's extensive training in crowd management and existing mutual aid agreements, suggesting ample local resources were available. This decision underscores a significant legal challenge to the Trump administration's use of federal forces in cities, emphasizing the importance of state sovereignty and judicial oversight in such matters.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest U.S. Lutheran denomination, made history by installing the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. Curry, who previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, succeeds the ELCA's first female leader, Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, and will serve a six-year term. This landmark moment for the predominantly white denomination reflects its commitment to diversity and multicultural ministries. Curry aims to foster a more connected and welcoming church, addressing challenges such as declining membership and navigating theological discussions on LGBTQ+ inclusion, building on the church's evolving leadership.</p>

          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport experienced a temporary closure of its airspace early Sunday morning, with local media and airport statements indicating the cause was a "possible series of balloons" heading towards the facility. This unforeseen incident led to the redirection of several flights to alternative airports, including Riga and Kaunas, causing disruptions for travelers. The event is the latest in a series of recent European airport closures, some attributed to drone sightings, highlighting a growing concern for airspace security and the challenges posed by unidentified aerial objects. Authorities are investigating the nature and origin of the balloons.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins, previously winless this season, pulled off a remarkable 42-37 upset victory against No. 7 Penn State, largely attributed to the strategic playcalling of newly elevated tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered an exceptional performance, scoring five touchdowns and leading an offense that significantly surpassed its previous point totals. This unexpected triumph, celebrated enthusiastically by players and fans alike, provides a much-needed morale boost and potential turning point for a team that had endured four consecutive losses and recent coaching staff departures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu" is a prevalent issue among new university students, comprising various common cold viruses that spread rapidly due to close living conditions and extensive social interaction. Immunologists explain that students' immune systems are often compromised during this period by factors such as stress, poor diet, insufficient sleep, and alcohol consumption. The constant exposure to a "mixing pot" of unfamiliar viral variants, coupled with a weakened immune response, makes it particularly difficult for students to avoid illness. Experts advise prioritizing rest and seeking medical attention if symptoms persist, emphasizing overall well-being during this transitional phase.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, effectively halting a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers upon reaching their 18th birthday. The ruling asserted that automatically detaining these individuals violates a previous 2021 court order, which mandated their release to the "least restrictive setting available" if they posed no danger. This decision adds to a series of ongoing legal battles challenging the administration's stringent immigration policies, particularly those impacting minors. Concerns persist regarding reported plans to incentivize self-deportation and accusations of reviving family separation tactics.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has successfully been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on her third attempt, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. Known for her staunch conservative stance, including past opposition to same-sex marriage and allowing married women to retain maiden names, she has recently adopted a softer tone with proposals for childcare support. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi advocates for reviving his "Abenomics" economic vision and easing constitutional restrictions on Japan's Self-Defence Forces. Her election marks a significant, albeit potentially challenging, new chapter for Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with many crediting President Trump for his role in brokering the deal. While expressing cautious optimism, protesters also voiced skepticism about Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to the peace process, fearing he might sabotage the agreement. The proposed U.S. 20-point plan includes a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, prisoner exchanges, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern the territory, though Hamas's disarmament remains a critical point of contention. The rally underscored a widespread public desire for peace and the immediate return of all captives.</p>

          <p>Billionaire populist Andrej Babis' ANO party emerged victorious in the Czech Republic's parliamentary election, securing just under 35% of the vote and 80 seats, though it fell short of an overall majority. Babis, who previously served as prime minister, is now expected to lead coalition talks, potentially with right-wing eurosceptic parties like Motorists for Themselves and Freedom and Direct Democracy. While he celebrated a "historic success," forming a stable government will require navigating ideological differences, particularly on EU and NATO membership, and his party's recent anti-Ukrainian rhetoric. The outcome signals a significant shift in Czech politics and potential changes in foreign policy direction.</p>

          <p>Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts have ignited significant title aspirations among their fanbase following an impressive unbeaten start to the season, highlighted by a dramatic Edinburgh derby victory. Head coach Derek McInnes acknowledges the fan excitement but maintains a professional focus on winning individual games, while experts like former midfielder Kevin Thomson support the fans' right to dream. The club's strong performance, bolstered by a substantial £10 million investment, has positioned them considerably ahead of traditional rivals like Rangers and Celtic, making a genuine challenge for the title or at least a high league finish seem increasingly plausible. This early success has generated immense buzz and confidence around Tynecastle.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, received an unexpectedly enthusiastic welcome from fans on his debut, who serenaded him with chants comparing him to a club legend despite his limited senior experience. Lammens secured a clean sheet, making two significant saves that showcased his agility and confidence, a stark contrast to recent goalkeeping performances. Head coach Ruben Amorim explained that the delay in Lammens' debut was a deliberate strategy for adaptation to a new country and the high pressure of the Premier League. This positive start provides a much-needed morale boost for United, who have now won three home games in a row, though Amorim acknowledges the team needs to translate this form to away matches.</p>

          <p>Turkey is engaged in a complex energy balancing act, remaining heavily dependent on Russia for significant portions of its oil and gas imports, which constitute over 66% and 41% of its respective needs. Despite mounting pressure from the US and G7 nations to reduce these purchases, Turkey continues to benefit from lower Russian prices following international sanctions. Concurrently, Turkey is proactively pursuing energy diversification, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms, and actively promoting domestic renewable energy sources. This strategic approach aims to bolster energy security and improve relations with the US, while carefully managing existing projects with Russia.</p>
