          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Cognition has announced its acquisition of Windsurf, another AI coding company, just days after Google hired away Windsurf's CEO and other senior staff in a multi-billion dollar deal. Cognition, known for its AI coding agent Devin, will acquire Windsurf's intellectual property, brand, and talent, though financial terms were not disclosed. The move highlights the intense competition for top talent in the AI sector, with Cognition's CEO emphasizing a united path forward for the combined teams.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. stock indices closed slightly higher on Monday, seemingly unaffected by the Trump administration's weekend announcement of new tariffs on the European Union and Mexico. These levies, set to begin August 1, revived trade tensions with key partners over issues including fentanyl trafficking and trade deficits. Despite the potential for increased consumer prices, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all posted modest gains, showing investor resilience in the face of renewed trade disputes.

          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab surged nearly 11% on Monday, extending a powerful rally that has seen the stock nearly double in the past two months. This growth is attributed to a series of successful launches and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company, which competes with firms like SpaceX, reports producing a new Electron rocket every 15 days to meet increasing demand in the competitive space industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer defended Apple CEO Tim Cook against calls for his resignation, arguing that Cook's successful track record has earned him the benefit of the doubt. Despite acknowledging challenges like a delayed AI rollout, the retirement of COO Jeff Williams, and a lagging stock price, Cramer expressed his continued faith in Cook's leadership. He maintained Apple as a core holding in his investment club's portfolio, emphasizing the indispensable nature of the iPhone as a reason to own the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, the Trump administration has pledged to make new weapons available to Ukraine, announcing a deal where the U.S. will sell military equipment to NATO members who will then supply it to Kyiv. While specifics were limited, the president confirmed the deal includes "everything," such as Patriot air defense systems, and will be worth billions of dollars. This arrangement allows vital military aid to flow to Ukraine without direct U.S. government payment, marking a significant development in the administration's policy.</p>
