          <p>A number of former Justice Department attorneys are running for elected office after resigning in protest of what they describe as the politicization of the agency under the Trump administration. These candidates, who lack traditional political backgrounds, are leveraging their experience as career prosecutors to campaign on restoring the rule of law. Figures like Ryan Crosswell in Pennsylvania and Erika Evans in Seattle cite the dismantling of anti-corruption and civil rights divisions as key motivators for their shift into electoral politics. Their campaigns are reportedly resonating with voters concerned about the recent changes within the Justice Department.</p>

He revealed that his wife, Kayla, gave birth to their fifth child, a daughter named Aine, in the back of a car while on the way to a hospital in New Zealand. Aki, who was in Brisbane for the first Test match at the time, learned of the birth through a video call just before a team meeting. The 35-year-old center had not seen his family for eight weeks and had yet to meet his newborn daughter, expressing his excitement to reunite with them.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing brief shaking in the surrounding region, including parts of New York City. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported the quake, noting that while it was felt, no damage or injuries were reported. A USGS analyst stated that such a minor quake would not be expected to cause damage. This event follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the same area in April 2024, which was one of the largest on the East Coast in the last century.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion on its last day, with England needing 35 runs and India requiring four wickets for victory. A tense fourth day at The Oval saw England, chasing a record 374, reach 339-6 before bad light and rain stopped play. England appeared to be cruising towards their target thanks to centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root, but a spirited fightback from India's seamers led to a late collapse. The stoppage likely favors England, who were struggling against the momentum of the Indian bowlers.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are turning up the heat, adding dozens of new spicy menu items in an effort to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers. Brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, which are often less expensive to implement than new proteins. This trend is driven by data showing younger generations' preference for bold, adventurous flavors, with up to 50% of Gen Z consumers eating spicy food weekly. Social media platforms like TikTok are playing a key role, as viral taste tests and challenges help drive the popularity of these limited-time offers.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, holding off a late charge from his teammate and championship rival, Oscar Piastri. After dropping to fifth on the opening lap, Norris executed a bold one-stop tire strategy to regain the lead, a move he later admitted he wasn't sure would work. Piastri, on fresher tires, closed the gap in the final laps but was unable to overtake on the notoriously difficult Hungaroring circuit. The victory narrows Piastri's championship lead to just nine points as Formula 1 heads into its summer break, setting up an intense battle for the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The structure is now weather-tight, and key infrastructure like baggage systems and future ticketing counters are taking shape. Set to be JFK's largest terminal, it will be dedicated solely to international travel and is designed to be flooded with natural light. The project is part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of the airport, aiming to modernize its aging facilities to accommodate growing air traffic and improve the passenger experience.</p>

          <h2>China Approves 183 Brazilian Coffee Exporters Following New U.S. Tariffs</h2>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a significant alternative market for Brazil's coffee industry. This development comes as the United States is set to impose a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other goods, creating a major challenge for exporters who sell approximately 8 million bags to the U.S. annually. While the U.S. has historically been a much larger market for Brazilian coffee than China, this approval signals a potential shift in global trade dynamics for the major commodity producer.
