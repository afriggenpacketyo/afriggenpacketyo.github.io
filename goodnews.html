          <h2>Effective Strategies for Managing Medical Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 15:24:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a significant percentage of adults carrying healthcare-related debt, several options exist to alleviate the financial burden. These include negotiating directly with the provider for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care if income-eligible, and utilizing a medical bill advocate to identify errors and overcharges. Traditional debt relief strategies like debt consolidation and debt management programs can help manage medical debt alongside other debts. Debt settlement is also an option, but should be considered as a last resort due to potential credit score damage and tax implications.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 15:22:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, led by Tonia Antoniazzi, addresses the small percentage of abortions that occur after 24 weeks due to "desperate circumstances". While this does not change existing laws regarding abortion services within a healthcare setting, it aims to provide care and support rather than criminalization for vulnerable women. Campaigners have welcomed the decision as a landmark moment for women's rights, though some organizations have expressed concerns about the potential implications.</p>

          <p>Streaming services have surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV for the first time, representing 44.8% of total TV viewership in May, according to a Nielsen report. This milestone is attributed to the rise of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels, YouTube's increasing popularity, and traditional media companies shifting to streaming-centric models. YouTube's main division, excluding YouTube TV, has seen significant growth since 2021, while Netflix remains the leading subscription provider. Recent restructuring announcements from major media companies may prompt further changes in the landscape.</p>

          <p>The NBA's push for parity, driven by a new collective-bargaining agreement, is resulting in more teams, especially those in small markets, having a chance at competing for a championship. The agreement makes it more difficult for teams to load up on multiple superstars, potentially impacting the dominance of big-market teams and traditional dynasties. However, the downside is that this shift may lead to some years where the Finals lack their usual buzz. The NBA is a business and there are a variety of factors that are at play here.</p>
