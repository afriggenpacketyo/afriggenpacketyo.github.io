          <p>A U.S. Air Force Colonel has revealed details about "Operation Midnight Hammer," a highly secretive mission involving seven B-2 stealth bombers. The 30-hour raid successfully struck Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz using 30,000-pound "bunker buster" bombs, marking their first use in combat. While specific operational details remain classified, the commander described the mission as a "flawless performance" by the highly experienced crews. The strikes have reportedly left Iran without a clear path to produce weapons-grade uranium for the first time in 15 years, significantly setting back its nuclear program.</p>

The agreement was formulated during trade talks in Madrid and is expected to be finalized in a call between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. arm or face a nationwide ban. The U.S. has cited national security concerns over the app's access to American user data.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has seen its market capitalization exceed $3 trillion, making it the fourth company to achieve this milestone alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, partly driven by relief over a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties. Despite facing increased competition in artificial intelligence and regulatory scrutiny, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. The achievement marks a significant point in the company's 20-year history since its initial public offering as Google. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual basis, a change that would require SEC approval. In a social media post, Trump argued the move would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea has been debated before, with figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon previously advocating for an end to quarterly guidance. Proponents of the current system argue that quarterly reports provide essential transparency and timely information for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Finds Renewable Energy Remains Most Cost-Effective Despite Policy Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the cheapest forms of energy, even when factoring in policy changes like tariffs and the phasing out of certain tax credits. Using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, the report shows renewables are more cost-competitive to generate than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While the Trump administration has expanded tax breaks for oil and gas, experts note that the high upfront capital for renewables is offset by very low operating costs, as the "fuel" is free.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates; Experts Advise on Financial Strategies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut this week, which would be the first since 2024, despite recent inflation data. This move could offer relief to consumers with variable-rate debt, such as credit cards, although experts caution that a single small cut will not drastically lower rates from their current highs. Financial advisors suggest that now is a good time for consumers to pay down high-interest debt and lock in high yields on savings accounts or CDs before those rates fall. The housing market could also benefit as lower rates may encourage more homeowners to sell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Banks Borrow $1.5 Billion from Federal Reserve's Repo Facility, Signaling Minor Funding Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:49:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF) on Monday, a move indicating some temporary tightness in the financial system's liquidity. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large Treasury security settlement, which increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent funding shortages. Analysts suggest the pressure is likely temporary and not a sign of a disruptive funding squeeze, as overnight borrowing rates had risen slightly above the interest the Fed pays on bank reserves.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is introducing a new policy effective September 25th for passengers traveling with lithium-powered wheelchairs and other mobility devices.

The policy also restricts battery size to 300 watt-hours or less, though a grace period for larger batteries will be in effect until January 2026.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock, his first open-market buy since 2020. The acquisition of 2.57 million shares was seen by investors as a strong vote of confidence, causing Tesla's stock to jump about 6%. The move comes as Musk, who currently owns around 13% of Tesla, pushes for greater control and a new compensation package. Tesla's stock has faced challenges this year due to slowing sales and increased competition, but some analysts see long-term potential in its pivot towards AI and robotics.

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant boost for the progressive candidate who has divided the Democratic party. In a New York Times op-ed, Hochul acknowledged past disagreements but praised Mamdani as a leader focused on affordability and safety. The endorsement is a notable development, as many establishment Democrats have withheld support for the self-proclaimed democratic socialist. Polls show Mamdani holding a strong lead over his rivals, including former governor Andrew Cuomo, ahead of the November election.</p>
