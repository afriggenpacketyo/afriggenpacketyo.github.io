        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully conducted a human trial for a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique, performed on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient, reportedly enabled him to regain some limb movement. The method contrasts with Elon Musk's Neuralink, which requires cranial surgery, and potentially offers reduced risks and faster recovery times for patients. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball. Despite a performance that manager Dave Roberts described as not their best, the team managed to secure the win. Key moments included a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani, who also hit a game-tying triple, and a go-ahead single from Mookie Betts. The bullpen held on for five scoreless innings to clinch the victory, highlighting the team's ability to win even when not playing perfectly.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and that the best plan is for him to remain with the team. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, signed a new five-year contract last year and had a breakthrough season. The manager's comments aim to quell speculation about the young player's future at Stamford Bridge.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have been sent back to China as their loan agreement expired. The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return. The Wakayama zoo has had a successful joint breeding program with a Chinese research base since 1994, raising 17 cubs. A farewell ceremony was held for the pandas, attended by thousands of visitors who expressed sadness over their departure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed, was assessed among nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those rich in omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. The findings suggest a potential link between traditional dietary patterns and mental health.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, and authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>The Bafta-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring Kat Sadler alongside her real-life sister Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships, tackling taboo subjects like mental health with dark humor. Sadler, who writes the series, says the new season is influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene and online trends. The comedy is known for its unflinching and often twisted female perspective, exploring family scheming and the desperate desire to avoid being single.</p>

          <p>Scientists are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old concept that uses bacteria-eating viruses called bacteriophages to treat infections. As antibiotic resistance grows into a global health crisis, this alternative approach is gaining new attention. Phages are highly specific, targeting only certain bacteria, which can make them effective against superbugs with fewer side effects than broad-spectrum antibiotics. A project at the University of Southampton is actively hunting for new phages, even in common places like household toilets, with the hope of developing them into viable treatments for patients with otherwise incurable infections.</p>

Launched in April, the satellite uses a special long-wavelength radar that can penetrate thick foliage and clouds to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. These initial images are revealing hidden details like wetlands and previously undetected deforestation. The ultimate goal of the 20-year project is to create a global 3D map of forests to more accurately calculate their role in the global carbon cycle.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has ruled against President Trump's campaign targeting elite law firms, permanently blocking an executive order against the firm Susman Godfrey. The judge declared the order unconstitutional, marking the fourth such defeat for the administration's policy. The series of executive orders sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and government contracts. In all four cases brought by different law firms, judges have found the orders to be a violation of constitutional rights and an attack on the legal system.</p>
