          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly working with investment banks to prepare an all-cash offer for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery. While no official offer has been received, the news caused WBD's stock to surge over 25%. This potential consolidation comes as the media industry grapples with the shift to streaming, which has disrupted traditional pay-TV models. The move follows the recent merger of Paramount and Skydance and WBD's own plans to separate its TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

The contest was initiated after Angela Rayner's resignation and the winner will serve as a key link between the party's membership and its leadership. Phillipson is seen as the establishment frontrunner, while Powell may attract members dissatisfied with the current government's direction.</p>

After overcoming injuries and initial struggles, his perseverance paid off, leading to a breakout season that finally attracted attention from top schools. His story is one of determination, highlighting how he turned down smaller offers to wait for a bigger opportunity.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of Elon Musk's vast fortune now stems from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, rather than his publicly traded company, Tesla. According to a Tesla proxy filing, this shift in wealth concentration is a key reason for a proposed new, potentially record-breaking pay package to ensure his focus remains on the electric vehicle maker. With SpaceX's valuation reportedly nearing $400 billion and xAI's surging, Musk's stakes in these private ventures are now estimated to be worth nearly twice his current Tesla holdings.

          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates has spurred a surge in demand from homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 6.35%, its lowest level since last October and the largest weekly decline in a year. In response, mortgage applications for home purchases rose to their highest point since July, while refinancing applications also saw a substantial increase. The falling rates are linked to recent data suggesting a weakening labor market, which has pushed down Treasury yields.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended restrictions on federal agents' use of 'less-lethal' weapons like projectile launchers and tear gas during protests in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera ruled that the First Amendment requires protecting journalists and peaceful protesters from indiscriminate force, which he described as having been used with 'surprising savagery.' The ruling bars the use of such weapons against reporters, legal observers, and non-threatening protesters unless there is an immediate and serious threat of physical harm, marking a victory for press freedom and civil liberties groups.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Patrick Reed has stated that paying American players to participate in the Ryder Cup is 'unnecessary.' His comments come as U.S. players are set to receive $500,000 each for the upcoming event, with a portion designated for charity. Reed, a former Ryder Cup standout, likened the event to the Olympics, arguing that the honor of representing one's country should be the sole motivation, not a monetary reward. European players have historically not been paid for their participation in the biennial golf tournament.</p>
