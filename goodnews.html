          <p>China has pledged to actively support peaceful development in the Horn of Africa through regional initiatives, as stated by its special envoy, Xue Bing, at a conference in Uganda. Beijing's commitment includes providing military assistance, training, infrastructure development, and increased trade to the eight participating East African nations. The envoy emphasized cooperation in areas like counterterrorism and landmine removal, while stressing support for "African-led solutions" through established regional bodies. This move underscores China's deepening engagement and strategic interests across the African continent, focusing on security and economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's burgeoning biotech sector. Innovent, which went public in Hong Kong in 2018 before generating revenue, is expected to see a major sales boost from its newly launched weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This shift to profitability signals a maturation of Chinese biotech start-ups, which are increasingly creating value for patients and are no longer solely reliant on investor funding. The success of these firms demonstrates their growing competitiveness in the global pharmaceutical market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an extra £100 million in funding to intensify efforts against illegal people smuggling across the English Channel, following a record number of crossings this year. The funds will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 new officers and advanced technology to disrupt smuggling gangs operating internationally. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the investment would help "track the gangs and bring them down." However, the move has been criticized by opposition parties as insufficient, highlighting the ongoing political struggle to control illegal migration.</p>

His family faced numerous obstacles evacuating from Gaza, where the healthcare system has been devastated by the conflict.

These snails, known for their vibrant and elaborately patterned shells, are being pushed toward extinction by the illegal shell trade, as their beauty makes them highly desirable to collectors. Researchers at the University of Nottingham and the Universidad de Oriente are using genetic research and captive breeding programs to better understand and protect the six known species. The project aims to combat the threat posed by poaching while also unraveling the evolutionary mystery behind their extraordinary colors.</p>

          <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for UK motorists who were mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commission payments. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while narrowing the scope for mass claims, affirmed that deals with excessively large, undisclosed commissions were unfair. The FCA banned these "discretionary commission arrangements" in 2021, as they incentivized dealers to charge customers higher interest rates. The proposed scheme, expected to launch next year, could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with millions of consumers potentially eligible for payouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a world-first public health initiative, sexual health clinics across the UK have begun offering a vaccine to combat record-high levels of gonorrhoea. The program will initially target those at highest risk, primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple partners or STIs. The 4CMenB vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is also 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea and is expected to prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade. Health officials hope the rollout will not only curb soaring infection rates but also slow the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of the disease.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey asserts that many people are broke not because they earn too little, but because their income is consumed by debt payments. He points to credit card bills, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits that prevent individuals from building wealth. Ramsey advises that income is the most powerful tool for financial growth, but it is rendered useless when given away to lenders. He proposes a three-step plan to regain control: create a zero-based budget, aggressively pay down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and avoid financing purchases by paying with cash.

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime insider of the Trump administration, has left her position as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Her departure marks one of the highest-ranking voluntary exits during Trump's second term. Mailman, who served throughout the first term and is known to be close to Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was considered a key figure in establishing the operations of the second administration. She reportedly plans to start a government affairs firm but will continue to serve as a special government employee to finalize some of her ongoing policy work.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume more than 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption, which followed a major earthquake in the region, prompted a temporary tsunami warning and was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude tremor. According to Russia's emergencies ministry, the ash cloud spread eastward over the Pacific Ocean without affecting any populated areas. Volcanologists confirmed this is the first historically recorded eruption of the volcano, with its last known activity dating back hundreds of years.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve their fertility, but the procedure comes with a hefty price tag and no guarantee of a future pregnancy. The all-in cost for a single cycle can average between $12,000 and $13,000, and many women undergo multiple cycles to improve their chances, with most paying out-of-pocket. Fertility experts caution that there is a significant drop-off at each stage, from thawing eggs to achieving a successful birth. While the technology offers women more reproductive options, the financial burden and uncertain success rates remain significant considerations for those pursuing it.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a groundbreaking AI model named Genie 2, which can generate playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image or text prompt. CEO Demis Hassabis explained that the technology represents a significant leap in creating "world models" that can understand and simulate reality. Beyond entertainment applications like generating games, these simulated worlds can be used to train AI agents and robots to perform complex tasks in a vast range of virtual scenarios. This advancement could accelerate progress in robotics by allowing for extensive training in simulated environments before deployment in the real world.</p>
