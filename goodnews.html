          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely removed from the Boeing 737 MAX 8, some using emergency slides as smoke was visible. The incident, which involved a tire maintenance issue and a small fire, resulted in minor injuries for a few individuals and caused temporary flight delays at the airport.</p>

Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat considered remarkable for its time. Despite skepticism that led to its removal from school curricula, scientists are using modern knowledge and new clues to restore what is considered a lost wonder of ancient technology.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, were trapped inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The outage disabled the train's air conditioning and lighting, leading to a prolonged and uncomfortable situation. The evacuation was further delayed when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel on their own, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety reasons before everyone could be brought to safety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with events at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775 with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the institution has played a crucial role in the nation's history. The celebration occurs amid ongoing discussions about the agency's future, including recent suggestions of privatization, though the new Postmaster General has stated his opposition to such a move.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news is a significant relief for the team, as it means he avoids a potentially season-ending injury. Judge received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 to 14 days, after which he hopes to initially return to the lineup as a designated hitter.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the legacy of the early 2000s reality show "The Osbournes," which transformed Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne into a beloved, albeit chaotic, television father. The show pioneered the "reality sitcom" format by blending the family's rock-and-roll lifestyle with mundane domestic situations, resonating with millions of viewers. Before the rise of other celebrity-driven reality TV, it offered an unprecedented, and often unscripted, look into a famous family's life, setting a new standard for the genre.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on a path to Catholic sainthood after being murdered in 2007. He was killed "mafia-style" for refusing to accept bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to enter the country. The Catholic Church has declared him a martyr for upholding his Christian values against corruption, and he was recently beatified, a significant step toward being officially recognized as a saint.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing laws to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing the struggling hospitality industry. Under the reforms, developers building new properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for opening new establishments or expanding outdoor areas would be streamlined. The changes hope to reverse the trend of pub closures and bring more vibrancy to town centers, though critics argue other government policies are harming the sector.</p>
