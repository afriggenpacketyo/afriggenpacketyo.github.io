          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 10:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components to lessen its strategic reliance on China, which dominates 70-80% of the global market. A recent report indicates Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, driven by a desire for a "non-red" supply chain free of Chinese influence and cybersecurity risks. While a complete decoupling is considered unrealistic due to China's control over raw materials, Germany is focused on diversifying critical parts like software and chips. However, progress is slow due to Germany's cost-focused procurement laws and Taiwan's own challenges in scaling up production capacity.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its Ernie generative AI model open source, a significant move that could disrupt the global AI landscape by offering a powerful, low-cost alternative to proprietary systems like those from OpenAI. This decision marks a strategic shift for Baidu, which previously favored a closed model, and is seen as a response to the success of other open-source disruptors like DeepSeek. While some experts believe this will democratize AI development and pressure competitors on pricing, others raise concerns about the security implications and potential for Chinese government influence as the model becomes more integrated into global applications.</p>

Cleveland will join in 2028, followed by Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia in 2030, with all three teams backed by existing NBA ownership groups who paid a $250 million expansion fee. This expansion reflects the surging demand for women's professional basketball, with the league capitalizing on rising viewership, attendance, and sponsorships.

This move is a key part of Home Depot's strategy to cater more to home professionals like electricians and renovators, who represent a steadier and more lucrative customer base.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has decided not to review a lower court's decision that blocked a strategic partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways. The Justice Department and several states had successfully sued to end the alliance in 2021, arguing that it harmed consumers by reducing airline competition in key markets, particularly in the Northeast. American Airlines had appealed, claiming there was no evidence the venture led to higher fares or reduced service. The Supreme Court's refusal to take the case effectively finalizes the ruling against the partnership, which JetBlue had already terminated about two years ago.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has proposed new online safety measures to better protect users, especially children. The proposals could compel tech platforms to prevent illegal content from going viral, limit virtual gifting on children's livestreams, and proactively detect terrorist material. These measures aim to build upon the UK's existing Online Safety Act to address constantly evolving digital harms. While the move is welcomed by some, safety advocates like the Molly Rose Foundation argue the proposals are insufficient and that the underlying act has systemic weaknesses, calling for a more comprehensive approach to compel platforms to fix risks at their source.</p>

This surge is driven by sustained investor enthusiasm for the company's central role in the artificial intelligence boom.

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate unexpectedly fell to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in years and signaling that price pressures in Europe's largest economy are easing. The figure was lower than the 2.2% that analysts had forecast. This development supports the view that the ECB's interest rate hikes have been effective, and economists suggest it could pave the way for one final rate cut later this year.

          <p>British qualifier Oliver Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, made a dream debut at Wimbledon by winning his first-round match in straight sets. The 21-year-old defeated Switzerland's Leandro Riedi 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 after successfully navigating three rounds of qualifying to enter the main draw. His impressive performance earned him a spot in the second round, where he could potentially face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Tarvet described the victory as a "dream come true" and a culmination of years of hard work, drawing an enthusiastic crowd on a hot day at the All England Club.</p>

          <h2>New UK-US Tariff Reduction Deal Takes Effect, but Steel Tariffs Remain Unresolved</h2>

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States that cuts tariffs on certain goods has officially come into force, primarily benefiting British car and aerospace manufacturers. The agreement reduces tariffs on up to 100,000 UK-made vehicles and eliminates them for aerospace exports to the U.S. However, the deal does not resolve the issue of steep U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum, which remain at 25% and could double if a separate agreement is not reached by a July 9 deadline. This uncertainty is causing a "massive headache" for UK steel producers who supply the U.S. market.</p>
