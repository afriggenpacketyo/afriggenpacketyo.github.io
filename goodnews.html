          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz is in Washington for his first meeting with US President Donald Trump, where discussions are expected to cover topics ranging from trade and defense spending to the war in Ukraine. Merz has stated his willingness to discuss German domestic politics with Trump, while also asserting his intention to express his own opinions clearly. The Trump administration is likely to raise concerns about German defense spending, trade imbalances, and perceived democratic backsliding, referencing a previous speech by Vice President JD Vance. While Merz aims to strengthen cooperation between Germany and the US, he does not anticipate any major breakthroughs on the key issues. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA teams have experienced an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, largely driven by the introduction of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The number of jersey patch deals has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing over $80 million in new spending. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are identified as the top-spending brands in the league. This increase follows the league's $77 billion media rights deal, indicating a strong financial outlook and growing interest in NBA sponsorships. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with Marlean Ames, an Ohio woman alleging employment discrimination by her gay employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services. Ames claims she was denied a promotion and later demoted in favor of less qualified gay candidates. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, delivering the opinion, stated that Ames was unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The court vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded the case, meaning Ames' lawsuit can proceed under the proper prima facie standard, though her success is not guaranteed. The ruling clarifies the legal standard for discrimination claims brought by members of a majority group.</p>

          <p>The article provides guidance on how to safely dispose of expired medications and sunscreen, emphasizing the importance of not using them after their expiration dates. Expired medications can become less potent or contaminated, posing health risks. Sunscreen should also be discarded after its expiration date due to decreased effectiveness. The best way to dispose of expired medications is through medication take-back locations, but household garbage disposal is an option if mixed with coffee grounds or kitty litter. Proper storage in a cool, dry place is crucial for maintaining medication efficacy. </p>
