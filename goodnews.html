          <p>The Grandview Institution, a Chinese think tank, suggests that the U.S. and China establish a "security dialogue mechanism" to prevent conflict in the South China Sea. The report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, highlights confrontational interactions in the waterway but deems the competition as still "manageable." Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi advocate for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security architecture, maritime legal order, law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols. The report acknowledges the risk of inadvertent escalation and emphasizes the need for consistent implementation of crisis management tools.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's export restrictions. Officials are evaluating how Indian Rare Earths (IREL) can increase rare earth magnet production. This follows Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal's call for India to provide an alternative to China, and echoing statements by Geoffrey Pyatt, who emphasized U.S.-India collaboration on critical minerals. While China dominates rare earth element production and processing, India's efforts could potentially ease global reliance on China for these crucial materials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee consumption is deeply rooted in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, with around two billion cups consumed daily worldwide. From the Ethiopian coffee ceremony to Senegal's "cafe Touba" and Turkey's unfiltered coffee tradition, the beverage holds ritual and social significance. Unique flavors include Nordic countries' "coffee cheese" and Vietnam's egg coffee, while Indonesia's "kopi luwak" remains ethically controversial. Cafes have historically served as incubators of ideas and revolution, from 16th-century Istanbul to Enlightenment-era Europe, and continue to evolve as refuges for modern life, with the emergence of cat cafes and spaces offering public internet access.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is launching a 100 billion yen ($700 million) policy package to attract foreign researchers, potentially targeting those leaving the United States due to research funding cuts. The initiative aims to establish a top-tier research environment in Japan, amid growing global competition for talent in fields like AI and semiconductors. Profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund will support universities in producing internationally competitive research. The policy will fund existing programs, raise researcher salaries, reduce administrative burdens, and acquire advanced technology for institutions, but Japan will also consider measures to retain researchers brought in from abroad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing is encouraging the use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters pivot to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. These L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, typically have a payment period of one year and can be used in both physical goods and trade in services.</p>

          <p>Japan anticipates receiving special treatment in tariff negotiations with the United States, as suggested by Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, following hints from U.S. President Donald Trump about raising import levies on cars. Akazawa believes that once bilateral negotiations are finalized, Japan will be treated differently from other countries. This comes as Trump indicated a potential increase in auto import tariffs to attract more investment in American manufacturing, which could negatively impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to progress talks before a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump.</p>

          <p>John Reade, head of research at the World Gold Council, asserts that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and stablecoins do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. He argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities and lack gold's hedging capabilities during market volatility. Reade believes long-term demand for gold remains strong due to concerns over US dollar assets, trade tensions, geopolitical issues, and the economic impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
