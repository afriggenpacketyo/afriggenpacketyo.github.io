          <p>Facing numerous lawsuits alleging harm to users' mental health, particularly among children, TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will automatically activate during "sleep hours" for users under 18. This initiative follows public pressure and lawsuits from state attorneys general, accusing TikTok of being intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to young users. The company hopes these features will promote healthier digital habits and address concerns about the platform's impact on its young audience.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, indicating that wealthy consumers are continuing to spend despite global economic uncertainty. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, driven by strong performance across most regions except Asia Pacific, where sales declined due to a drop in China. This report follows Richemont's "highest ever" quarterly sales in January, initially signaling a potential turnaround in the luxury sector. However, ongoing macroeconomic concerns and potential trade tariffs continue to pose threats to consumer confidence and discretionary spending worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could offer insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced major population declines throughout history. Archaeological evidence suggests human migration from northern Asia to South America occurred at least 23,000 years ago.</p>

Johansson's legal team took action, leading OpenAI to remove "Sky." She emphasizes the need for agreed-upon boundaries to prevent AI from being detrimental and believes more public figures should support and speak out on the issue.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets due to trade policy uncertainties. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds. These inflows were the largest since Japan's finance ministry began collecting data in 1996. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact the appeal of Japanese assets. (not investment advice)</p>
