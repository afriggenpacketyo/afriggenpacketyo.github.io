          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:41:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, savers are facing diminishing returns on high-yield accounts. However, opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October still presents strategic advantages, such as locking in current rates before they potentially drop further. With the CME Group's FedWatch tool indicating a high probability of another rate cut at the end of the month, the article suggests that proactive savers can benefit from compounding interest by acting sooner rather than later. Financial institutions may also preemptively lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the Seattle Seahawks' recent victory over the Arizona Cardinals, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba's frustrated reaction to a holding penalty was broadcast to a national audience. After a flag nullified a touchdown, Smith-Njigba audibly yelled an expletive which was picked up by head referee Alex Kemp's open microphone. Kemp paused his announcement and glared at the player but did not issue an additional penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, a decision praised by the broadcast commentators. Despite the incident, Smith-Njigba played a key role in the game, making a crucial catch that set up the game-winning field goal for the Seahawks.</p>

          <p>Sinclair has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, following a temporary suspension of the program. The preemption by Sinclair and Nexstar Media Group came after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments about the alleged murder of a conservative activist. The situation sparked a debate over media influence and First Amendment rights, particularly after an FCC commissioner suggested stations could risk their licenses. In its statement, Sinclair emphasized its commitment to responsible broadcasting and respectful dialogue, while noting that Disney's ABC has not yet adopted its proposed measures to strengthen accountability.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who had the whip withdrawn for voting against the government's two-child benefit cap, which was the first major rebellion of Keir Starmer's premiership. This move comes as the Labour government faces increasing internal and external pressure to abolish the controversial policy, which prevents parents from claiming certain credits for more than two children. Recently, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson signaled that scrapping the cap is now under consideration by ministers.</p>

          <p>A UK judge has thrown out a terrorism charge against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara. The charge stemmed from an allegation that he displayed a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, which he denied. The chief magistrate ruled that the proceedings were unlawfully instituted because they lacked the necessary consent from the attorney general within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence his activism regarding the conflict in Gaza and affirmed his solidarity with the Palestinian cause.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has announced it will permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some of its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This decision marks a significant step in rebuilding regulatory trust after years of heightened oversight following two fatal MAX crashes and 787 production issues. The FAA had stripped Boeing of this authority in 2019 for the MAX and in 2022 for the Dreamliner, taking over the certification process directly. Under the new plan, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks, allowing FAA inspectors to focus more on production surveillance.</p>

          <p>Actor William Petersen is reflecting on his breakout year, during which he starred in two of the 1980s' most influential crime films, "To Live and Die in L.A." and "Manhunter." In an interview ahead of a double-feature screening, Petersen discussed the contrasting directorial styles of William Friedkin and Michael Mann, which provided him with an incredible education. He recalled Friedkin's improvisational, high-energy approach for "To Live and Die in L.A.," which included a famously dangerous car chase he drove himself. Conversely, he described Mann's work on "Manhunter" as meticulously crafted and controlled, creating a much more psychologically disturbing experience on set.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup began with a surge of American energy, as Bryson DeChambeau nearly drove the first green to secure an early lead in front of a roaring home crowd at Bethpage Black. However, the initial momentum quickly faded as Team Europe mounted a decisive counterattack. The European pairings of Jon Rahm with Tyrrell Hatton and Rory McIlroy with Tommy Fleetwood delivered commanding victories in the morning foursomes. By the end of the session, Europe had quieted the partisan crowd and established a strong 3-1 lead, with only one American pair managing to salvage a point, preventing a complete European sweep.</p>

          <p>Arts and crafts retailer Michaels is bringing the Joann fabric brand back to life by incorporating "Knit & Sew Shop" sections within its stores. This move follows Joann's bankruptcy and the closure of all its locations earlier in the year. Michaels, which purchased Joann's intellectual property, will feature Joann's branding and popular private-label products, like Big Twist yarn, in these new shop-in-shops. The expansion, which also includes new party supply sections, positions Michaels to capture market share left by the closures of both Joann and Party City, making it the largest specialty fabric and party retailer in North America.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have slightly reduced the cost of borrowing through home equity loans. For a $150,000 loan, the current average monthly payment is approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term and $1,452 for a 15-year term. This represents a modest saving of around $16 per month compared to rates from earlier in the year. While the immediate savings are not dramatic, the potential for future rate cuts in late 2025 and 2026 makes exploring home equity financing a potentially worthwhile option for homeowners needing a large sum of money.

          <p>Costco reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue, though its results were met with some investor caution due to slight underperformance in key areas. The company's same-store sales growth of 5.7% fell just short of the 5.9% estimate, and a minor dip in membership renewal rates contributed to a modest stock decline. Despite these issues, analysts noted many positive signs, including strong membership fee growth and impressive traffic, particularly from online signups which attract a younger demographic. The report underscores Costco's resilience in a challenging retail environment, though its high stock valuation presents a challenge for new investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils, including the historic "Java Man" bones, to Indonesia. The fossils, known as the Dubois Collection, were excavated from the then-Dutch colony in 1891 by anthropologist Eugene Dubois and are considered the first known fossils of the human ancestor Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from an independent committee, which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population.

          <p>A retirement strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of a retiree's savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, typically a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and unexpected costs. By blending the security of a pension-like income stream with the flexibility of market investments, the strategy aims to reduce stress from market volatility and provide a stable financial foundation for retirees.
