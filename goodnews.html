          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in over a century. A group of 28 Indigenous teenagers marked the milestone by becoming the first to kayak the river's entire 310-mile length, an event that drew international river advocates. This successful restoration project is now serving as a global model, inspiring other Indigenous-led movements to protect and rejuvenate waterways around the world.</p>

          <p>The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, holds a unique place in U.S. history, having temporarily served as the White House for President James Madison after the original was burned in 1814. It was in this house that Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, officially ending the War of 1812. Now a museum, the building is also famous for its reported paranormal activity, with staff and visitors recounting unexplained events, including a story of Jackie Kennedy Onassis feeling the presence of Dolley Madison's spirit.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a comfortable 26-6 victory over England in the first Rugby League Ashes match in 22 years at Wembley. The Kangaroos demonstrated superior quality, particularly in the second half, after a hard-fought opening. Full-back Reece Walsh was the standout player, scoring the opening try and adding another later in the game. Despite a late consolation try from England's Daryl Clark, Australia's dominant performance sets a high bar for the remainder of the series.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael, conceded the election while votes were still being counted. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker, ran on a platform that included strong criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and gained the support of several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, becoming the third woman to hold the largely ceremonial but constitutionally important role.</p>

          <p>Some financial professionals are observing that the popular passive investment strategy of buying broad market index ETFs, like those tracking the S&P 500, is losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification. The S&P 500 has become heavily weighted towards the technology sector, which now comprises a record 35% of the index, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low. Consequently, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

While some sleep technology can be beneficial for those with specific medical conditions, the increasing reliance on complex systems introduces new points of failure into what should be a natural biological process.</p>

Described as an "underwater phantom," the small, lightweight drone is made from a transparent hydrogel material, allowing it to operate almost silently with low power consumption. Its lifelike design makes it ideal for observing fragile ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, and potentially for covert military applications without disturbing the surrounding environment.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has sold for $37 million at an auction in Paris, exceeding expectations. The painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The work captures a poignant moment at the end of Picasso's and Maar's tumultuous relationship, with experts noting its remarkably preserved, vivid colors, which had previously only been seen in a black-and-white photograph.</p>

Health authorities warn that flu can "spread like wildfire" in schools and cause serious illness, emphasizing that vaccination is the most effective protection. While many children have received the nasal spray vaccine at school, pop-up clinics and GP surgeries are available for those who still need it during the half-term break.</p>
