          <p>Volodymyr Zelensky has responded cautiously to Vladimir Putin's offer of direct talks in Istanbul. While Zelensky called it a positive sign, both leaders are trying to avoid being seen as obstacles to peace by Donald Trump. Trump hinted that the war was close to ending, and Putin expressed a desire to address the root causes of the conflict. The situation remains fluid, with much depending on Trump's next actions and whether Russia commits to a proposed 30-day ceasefire.</p>

          <p>John Cameron Mitchell, a performer and filmmaker, reflects on his college speaking tour and the need for young people to embrace punk as a form of D.I.Y. collective action. He shares anecdotes about his father, a closeted bisexual Army major general, and Claude Cahun, a French Jewish Surrealist, to illustrate the spirit of punk. Mitchell encourages students to stop canceling each other, explore punk culture, and engage in real-world connections to combat the isolation and division fostered by corporate-controlled, like-driven culture.

          <p>Elissa Strauss challenges the traditional "Hero's Journey" narrative, arguing that motherhood and caregiving can also be seen as epic quests filled with trials, triumphs, and profound insights. She contends that caring for another person can be a life-altering experience that leads to self-discovery and a deeper understanding of human connection. Strauss advocates for recognizing the value and complexity of domestic and familial journeys, suggesting that this perspective can foster greater respect and support for parents and caregivers in a society often focused on rugged individualism.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, an offer that has been met with a cautious but positive response from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This development comes after European leaders threatened to impose further sanctions if Russia did not commit to a 30-day ceasefire. While Putin has called for negotiations without preconditions, Zelenskyy has emphasized the need for a complete and unconditional ceasefire as a first step towards peace.</p>
