        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the online marketplace Vinted, developed the idea for the platform after realizing she had too many clothes to fit into her new, smaller apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, built a simple website to sell her unwanted items, which quickly gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early mistakes, such as initially forgetting a 'buy' button and a failed attempt at charging commission, the company grew into Lithuania's first tech 'unicorn.' Vinted is now a major player in the sustainable fashion movement, with over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>

The event, founded by Sir Brendan Foster, continues to grow in popularity, drawing large crowds and celebrity participants. Foster noted a trend of more young people and a significant increase in female runners over the years, with women now making up nearly half of the participants.</p>

          <p>A growing number of countries, including France, Canada, and Australia, have announced their intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This follows the formal recognition by Ireland, Norway, and Spain earlier in 2024, bringing the total number of nations that recognize Palestine to 147. While a UN General Assembly resolution in May showed overwhelming support with 143 votes, full UN membership for Palestine remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council, though the diplomatic momentum continues to build.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Powerball Data Reveals States with Highest and Lowest Payouts for Winners</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a record-breaking $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot won by tickets in Texas and Missouri, an analysis shows where winners can maximize their take-home prize. States with no state income tax on lottery winnings, such as Florida, Texas, and Washington, offer the highest potential payouts after federal taxes are withheld. Conversely, states with high income taxes, like New York, result in the lowest net winnings for jackpot recipients. The report also details the odds of winning and notes that Saturday's drawing marked the 42nd consecutive one without a jackpot winner, setting a new record.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has expressed that he feels he should have played more during a relatively quiet first home summer in international cricket. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who made a strong impression in his debut Test series last winter, has had limited opportunities this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his place in the Test lineup and played only sparingly in domestic matches, leading to questions about how his development is being managed by England's cricket authorities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are utilizing deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in one of these statuses. Deferments can be more advantageous, as the government may cover the interest on subsidized loans during the pause for reasons like unemployment or economic hardship. Forbearances are more widely available but typically result in interest accumulation, which can significantly increase the total loan balance over time. While these tools prevent default, experts advise they are short-term solutions and income-driven repayment plans are often a better long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, often called the 'silent killer' because it typically has no symptoms, affects over half of Americans by age 40 and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Experts stress that early treatment can significantly increase healthy life expectancy by preventing damage to blood vessels in the heart and brain. A new class of medication targeting the hormone aldosterone is also showing promise for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.</p>

          <p>This financial article identifies three companies—PepsiCo, ConocoPhillips, and Watsco—as potentially strong high-yield dividend stocks for investors to consider in September. It notes that an activist investor has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo, signaling belief in its undervalued potential, while ConocoPhillips shares have dipped due to lower energy prices, creating a possible entry point. Watsco, a leader in the HVACR market, is also presented as a solid long-term option despite facing temporary market softness, making it another candidate for dividend-focused portfolios.

          <p>With the price of gold surging to record highs near $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure to gold through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than owning physical bullion, which involves higher transaction and storage costs. While gold is seen as a hedge against economic downturns and geopolitical instability, financial advisors typically suggest limiting its allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio.

          <p>Observations from four powerful telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb, have confirmed that the third-ever detected interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is highly unusual. While believed to be a comet, data reveals it has the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever observed and was active much farther from the Sun than typical comets. Additionally, it displays a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon but lacks a distinct tail, adding to its mystery. Scientists are analyzing the data to understand its unique composition and origins as it continues its journey through our solar system.</p>

          <p>A district judge in Utah has thrown out the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of voters who had approved an independent redistricting commission. The 2021 map was criticized for 'cracking' Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County into four separate districts, ensuring Republican victories in all of them. The ruling is a significant victory for voting rights advocates and a rare pushback against partisan gerrymandering, ordering lawmakers to draw a new, fairer map. The decision comes amid a national trend of both parties attempting to draw districts for political advantage.</p>
