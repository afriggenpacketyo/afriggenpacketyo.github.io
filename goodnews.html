          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has increased at a bodega in East Flatbush due to rising costs. Freddy and Yovanna Melo, owners of El Vacilon Grocery, raised the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019. The decision was driven by soaring egg prices, along with higher costs for bacon, cheese, and bread. The Melos, who own their building, rely on the sandwich, known as "bandera," to attract customers and maintain their business. This price increase reflects the broader impact of inflation on everyday items in the city.</p>
