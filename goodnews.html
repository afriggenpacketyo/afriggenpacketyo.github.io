          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global trade order uncertainty, with the People‚Äôs Action Party (P.A.P.) widely expected to retain power, marking their sixth decade in control. However, growing discontent over the rising cost of living is fueling the opposition. While the P.A.P. has historically delivered stability and prosperity, many Singaporeans no longer feel prosperous, as median wealth has declined despite increasing average wealth. The opposition has criticized the short campaigning period and redrawing of election boundaries, but the P.A.P. maintains its commitment to stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools, a victory for the state after it refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills responded to the president's threats by stating, "We'll see you in court," and Maine subsequently sued the USDA. The settlement ensures that funds for a child nutrition program will be restored, helping to feed 172,000 children in the state.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked its enforcement. The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing clients disliked by the president, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. The ruling marks a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's use of government power for retribution. The judge emphasized the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to defend constitutional rights without fear of reprisal.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man, Tim Friede, who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an "unparalleled" antivenom, according to scientists. Antibodies in Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. This could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites, which kill up to 14,000 people a year. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, creating an antivenom cocktail that showed impressive protection in mice.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate and Columbia University student, was detained during his citizenship naturalization interview, but was released after a federal judge ruled in his favor. Mahdawi claims the Trump administration is attempting to deport him for political speech that it dislikes, accusing him of undermining U.S. foreign policy for opposing the killing of Palestinians. He argues that the administration is suppressing dissent and compromising the integrity of the immigration system. He connects his struggle for justice with the freedom of other detained students and the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products directly from China to customers in the United States, transitioning to local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices and add import charges, but has now shifted to local fulfillment. The move aims to help local merchants and maintain pricing for U.S. consumers.</p>
