          <h2>French Technology Aims to Reduce China's Reliance on Imported Aluminium Ore</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a major aluminium producer, relies heavily on imported bauxite due to a lack of high-quality domestic ore. A plant in Shanxi province is upgrading to use French technology developed by Yves Ocello from IB2 to process low-grade bauxite, which was previously unusable. This technology neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing the Bayer process to refine high-silica bauxite efficiently. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement this greener aluminium production method, aligning with Beijing's plan for a more environmentally friendly industry.</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphatically stated that Canada is "not for sale" in response to President Trump's repeated suggestions of the U.S. acquiring Canada. Trump romanticized the idea of merging the two countries, citing the benefits of removing the "artificial" border. Carney countered by emphasizing the value of the partnership between the two nations and urging Trump to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state. Trade discussions will continue, with both leaders acknowledging the complex nature of negotiations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new law that will make it a criminal offense to climb on the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, along with other war memorials. Offenders could face up to three months in prison and a ¬£1,000 fine for desecrating the monument. The move comes after the statue has been a frequent target for demonstrators, including those from Occupy Democracy, Extinction Rebellion, and trans rights campaigns, who have sprayed graffiti and waved placards from its plinth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Burger King is facing a class action lawsuit alleging that its Whopper advertisements exaggerate the size of the burger compared to what customers actually receive. The lawsuit claims the Whopper appears 35% larger in ads and contains more than twice the actual amount of meat. A judge ruled that it is plausible some consumers could be misled, while Burger King denies the claims, stating the patties are the same in ads and in restaurants. Subway is facing a similar lawsuit over misleading ads for its Steak & Cheese sandwich.</p>
