          <p>AOL is officially ending its iconic dial-up internet service, a technology that introduced many American households to the online world in the 1990s. The service, known for its distinct modem sounds, will be discontinued for subscribers in the US and Canada on September 30. This decision reflects the overwhelming shift to broadband, with government data showing fewer than 300,000 dial-up users compared to over 300 million with high-speed connections. The company, now owned by Apollo Global, was once a dominant force with over 30 million subscribers at its peak.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium companies saw a significant rally after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The temporary shutdown, caused by an expired permit, has tightened the global lithium supply, as the mine accounts for about 4% of the world's projected 2025 output. Consequently, investors anticipate higher lithium prices, which drove up stock values for miners like Albemarle and the Sprott Lithium Miners ETF. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production upon approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates, certificates of deposit (CDs) present a safe and predictable investment alternative to a volatile stock market. This article calculates the potential interest earnings for a $50,000 CD across various term lengths, from three months to five years, based on today's top rates. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% could yield $2,200, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could earn over $11,000. These fixed-rate, FDIC-insured accounts offer reliable returns for savers seeking stability for their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis-related stocks experienced a major rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category under federal law. Companies like Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands saw their shares surge over 25% and 41% respectively. Such a change, likely moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, would significantly benefit the industry by altering tax regulations and boosting investor interest. While Trump stated a decision would come in the next few weeks, the final authority rests with the Attorney General. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered an unusual deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China with the U.S. government. In return, the companies receive export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, securing access to the lucrative Chinese market. Analysts view this as a net positive for the companies, as 85% of revenue is better than zero, but it sets a strange precedent. The move is seen as a way for the U.S. to compete with Chinese rivals like Huawei while extracting a "tax" on business in a strategic sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock gained after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery. The movie theater chain posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, a 35% increase year-over-year, and significantly narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million from $32.8 million a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive performance to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and record-high revenue per patron. The company has also successfully restructured its debt, pushing maturities from 2026 to 2029.</p>

          <p>While a new study warns of potential shortages of key minerals needed for the clean energy transition, this article argues that fears of "peak mineral" may be premature. Drawing parallels to the "peak oil" theory, which was overcome by technological innovation, the analysis points to rapid advancements in clean energy. For example, battery makers are reducing or eliminating the need for cobalt, and sodium-ion batteries offer an alternative to lithium. These substitutions and efficiency gains suggest that long-term predictions of mineral shortfalls are highly theoretical and may not account for future breakthroughs.</p>
