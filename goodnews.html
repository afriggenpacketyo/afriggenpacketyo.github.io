          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between US Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that US Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. This announcement comes after former President Biden blocked Nippon Steel's bid to buy US Steel, and it will now be subject to another national security review. Trump claims the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. The president will hold a rally at US Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.</p>

          <p>Undergraduate students at Ramapo College of New Jersey have helped identify the skeletal remains of Henry Goodsell, a sea captain who died nearly 200 years ago. Goodsell was the captain of the schooner Oriental, which sank off the coast of New Jersey in 1844. Using investigative genetic genealogy, the students matched DNA from bone fragments found on South Jersey beaches to Goodsell's descendants. This identification is one of the oldest cold cases solved using this method, highlighting the power of modern genealogy testing in resolving historical mysteries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wage garnishment by the IRS can be a stressful financial consequence, but tax relief strategies can help resolve unpaid debt and halt enforced collections. Effective methods include installment agreements, offers in compromise, currently not collectible status, and innocent spouse relief. Acting quickly and choosing the right strategy is crucial, and consulting with tax relief professionals can aid in negotiating with the IRS and requesting a garnishment release. Documenting financial distress and demonstrating a good faith effort to resolve the debt can also improve the chances of stopping wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>
