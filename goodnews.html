          <p>Scientists in Singapore have significantly advanced the development of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, envisioning their future deployment in disaster search and rescue missions. Their research, published in Nature Communications, details improvements in the robotic insects' control, specifically enhancing their turning ability from 70 to over 80 degrees. This "insect robot factory" concept aims to industrialize production, making these hybrid robots more cost-effective and quicker to deploy for practical applications. The innovation offers a unique and potentially life-saving solution for navigating hazardous, confined spaces in disaster zones, where human access is often impossible, contributing a novel approach to humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge ruled the state's Republican-controlled legislature illegally drew congressional boundaries in 2021, violating voters' rights. The existing map, which fragmented the Democratic stronghold of Salt Lake County across four Republican-leaning districts, bypassed a voter-approved commission designed for nonpartisan redistricting. This landmark decision necessitates a rapid redrawing of the maps before the 2026 midterm elections, though potential appeals by Republican lawmakers could prolong the process. The ruling creates significant political uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the US House and highlights the ongoing national struggle for fair and equitable electoral representation.</p>

          <p>Korean Air and Boeing finalized a substantial $36 billion deal for 103 new passenger and cargo jets, a development occurring as President Trump intensifies pressure on trading partners to bolster business with American companies. This agreement, encompassing Boeing 787, 777, and 737 models, is set to modernize the South Korean flag carrier's fleet, crucial for its merger with Asiana Airlines. The announcement came shortly after a meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Trump, where US tariffs on the Asian nation were a key topic. This significant purchase, alongside Hyundai's increased US investment, reflects a strategic response to US trade demands and is projected to support approximately 135,000 jobs across the United States.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have traded veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This unexpected move addresses the Raiders' immediate need for a backup quarterback, following Aidan O’Connell’s wrist injury that will sideline him for up to eight weeks. Pickett, with 25 NFL starts under his belt, is expected to serve as Geno Smith's primary backup. His trade clarifies the Browns' quarterback situation, ensuring they won't carry four signal-callers, though the competition for the backup role behind starter Joe Flacco among rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders remains ongoing ahead of the regular season roster deadline.</p>

          <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed an upcoming announcement this week regarding Japan's $550 billion investment in the United States, stemming from a July trade agreement. Under that deal, Japan secured a reduced 15% tariff on its goods in exchange for this significant investment, channeled through government-backed loans and guarantees. Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is reportedly in Washington to formalize the agreement, with Tokyo hoping for a less legally binding document and a presidential order to further lower tariffs on Japanese cars. This clarification aims to resolve previous uncertainties surrounding the trade terms and tariff exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, first due to an oxygen leak and then an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This crucial mission aims to test significant fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is vital for accelerating Starship's development, particularly for autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a prerequisite for NASA's Artemis moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual Mars missions. Despite ongoing engineering challenges and some expert skepticism regarding the 2027 moon landing timeline, SpaceX founder Elon Musk maintains confidence in perfecting orbital refueling and full reusability, key technologies for establishing a city on Mars.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to US schools, a reversal prompted by a multi-state lawsuit challenging its abrupt decision to freeze the congressionally-allocated money. These funds are vital for programs such as after-school care, summer learning, teacher training, and support for English-learners. Initially, the administration offered vague explanations, with a spokesperson suggesting concerns about federal money subsidizing a "radical left-wing agenda." However, states argued the withholding was illegal under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The restoration is a significant win for states, ensuring critical educational services for approximately 1.4 million children, many from low-income families, can resume.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully halted a brush fire that consumed approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek. While the fire's spread has been stopped, achieving full containment necessitates the use of heavy equipment for extensive mop-up operations and the establishment of bare-earth dozer lines around the perimeter, an effort projected to last into the early evening. No injuries were reported, but fire officials cautioned about potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway. This incident occurs amidst an ongoing 10.2-mile repavement project on the 405, which already includes a series of overnight lane closures, adding to anticipated travel disruptions for local residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conventional wisdom about maintaining a "bolt upright" posture is being challenged, with new insights suggesting it can be detrimental to back health. Dr. Xand van Tulleken outlines three essential rules for improving back health: prioritize consistent movement, build foundational strength, and cultivate a positive mindset. He emphasizes that dynamic posture, involving regular breaks and shifts in position, is far more beneficial than remaining static, even in an ergonomic chair. Strengthening core and back muscles through simple exercises like arm raises or yoga provides natural support. Ultimately, acknowledging that emotional and psychological stress significantly contribute to pain means addressing mental well-being is as critical as physical adjustments for comprehensive posture and back health.</p>

This marks the first opportunity for Gazan students to leave the territory for UK studies since the onset of the Hamas-Israel war in 2023. However, significant logistical and diplomatic hurdles persist, notably securing Israel's individual approval for each student's departure and arranging necessary visa biometric checks in a third country. This decision follows months of campaigning by politicians and academics, underscoring ongoing humanitarian efforts, as the UK also prepares to evacuate critically ill and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment.</p>

Despite Newcastle's resilient comeback with ten men, their inefficiency in front of goal and the unresolved Isak situation underscore the urgent need for a resolution before the transfer window closes, solidifying this heated new football rivalry.</p>
