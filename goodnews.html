          <p>Following a collision with a Mexican navy ship, officials inspected the Brooklyn Bridge and found no significant structural damage to its load-bearing elements. The New York City Department of Transportation confirmed this finding on X, while the NTSB corroborated the lack of structural damage. The NTSB is investigating the incident, including weather conditions, the ship's operations, and potential recording devices on board, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. The investigation will involve interviews with crew members, tugboat operators, and a review of surveillance footage to determine the cause of the collision. The ship was en route to sail south down the East River and head for sea when the incident occured.</p>

          <p>After former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, this article provides an overview of the disease. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, often detected through screening tests like PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams. Treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer, ranging from observation and surgery to radiation and hormone therapy. While metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, advancements in medical management have significantly improved survival rates over the past three decades. The article includes information on signs and symptoms, screening methods, treatment options, and survival rates associated with prostate cancer.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Climb Above 7% After Moody's Downgrades U.S. Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 18:12:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to concerns about rising government debt. This is the first time since April 11 that the average 30-year mortgage rate has surpassed this threshold, though it eased slightly later in the day. Despite Federal Reserve interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates remain high, tracking the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions. Elevated rates, combined with a shortage of affordable properties, continue to challenge aspiring homebuyers, with only a fraction of listed homes being affordable for households with a $75,000 annual income.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The decision declares the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as "null and void" and orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the administration's actions, including terminating board members and dispersing assets, were unconstitutional. She emphasized that USIP supports both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank and that the President's removal power does not extend outside the Executive branch. The ruling allows USIP to resume its work in promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations covering fishing, trade, defence, and energy, aiming to move past Brexit disagreements. A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized looking forward, Conservatives and Reform UK criticized the deal as a "surrender" to the EU. The agreement includes measures to reduce paperwork for food and drink imports/exports, and allows the UK to participate in the EU's proposed new ¬£150bn defence fund.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given suggests that Jack Grealish may need to leave the club this summer due to limited playing time. Grealish, who joined City for ¬£100m in 2021, has seen his role diminish, with fewer starts and minutes this season compared to previous years. Given criticized Grealish's lack of opportunities in crucial FA Cup final matches, suggesting manager Pep Guardiola's treatment of the player is unfair. Guardiola acknowledged that discussions will occur regarding Grealish's future, but emphasized that all players are unhappy when they don't play, not just Grealish.</p>

          <p>A luxury Boeing 747 gifted to the U.S. government by Qatar is currently in San Antonio, Texas, awaiting a specialized overhaul to become the next Air Force One. The offer of the $400 million plane came as President Trump was leaving for a trip to the Middle East, during which Qatar announced plans to invest over $1 trillion in business deals with the United States. Experts suggest retrofitting the plane to meet presidential security standards could take years, potentially creating security risks if rushed.

Other notable performances included Garbage, OMD, and Alison Moyet. The Go-Go's performance, however, was described as uncoordinated with sound issues, while Death Cult's set was deemed odd due to confusion over the band's identity and a lack of crowd engagement.</p>
