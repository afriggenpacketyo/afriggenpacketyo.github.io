          <p>An elementary school in England hosted a mobile prison to teach students about the realities of life behind bars. The project, led by former police officer Mick Amos, aims to deter crime by showing children the consequences of their actions. Students dressed as inmates are scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted before entering replica jail cells complete with stainless-steel toilets. The experience is designed to open conversations about drugs, alcohol, violence, sexting, and knife crime, providing information to help young people make informed choices and understand their responsibilities under the law. The mobile prison also visits youth clubs and sports organizations, funded by cash seized from criminals.</p>
