          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 senior cartel figures to the United States to face charges. The group includes leaders from the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, such as Abigael González Valencia of "Los Cuinis." This move comes amid U.S. pressure on Mexico to intensify its efforts against drug trafficking and fentanyl production. Mexican officials stated the transfers were a sovereign decision aimed at dismantling criminal networks operating from within prisons.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeals has rejected rapper Tory Lanez's request to introduce new evidence in his case concerning the 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year sentence, sought to present a new statement from a security guard and challenge the fact that his driver did not testify. His legal team claimed this new evidence would show he was not the shooter. This denial marks another failed attempt by Lanez to challenge his 2022 felony conviction for assault with a firearm.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" is experiencing a significant ratings surge, with its second episode attracting 6.2 million viewers across platforms, a 49% increase from the season premiere. The show's renewed popularity is attributed to its sharp satirical takes on political figures, including President Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. This success comes as the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, operate under a massive $1.5 billion deal with Paramount, which recently settled a lawsuit with Trump over a separate matter.</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to sign 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of approximately £26 million. The Italy Under-19 international has become a key target for the Premier League club as it looks to strengthen its defensive lineup. In addition to the Leoni signing, Liverpool is also in ongoing negotiations with Crystal Palace for England center-back Marc Guehi. These potential acquisitions would significantly increase the club's summer spending as they build their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, as investors grow more confident that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. This market rotation saw a pullback in some megacap technology stocks, with the Magnificent 7 Index declining slightly. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs for operations and expansion. Market sentiment, reflected in futures trading, now indicates a nearly 100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods. The move comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's own CFO has stated the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded benefit, one of the most requested by staff, applies to 1.6 million U.S. employees. This could help retain workers and encourage them to spend more at Walmart, potentially offsetting some of the financial pressure on their families.</p>

The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's owner moving to Tennessee, with Habit's CMO stating they are "proudly Californian and we're not going anywhere."

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' equity has reached a new record, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders having tappable equity. The average homeowner now holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. Homeowners can access this wealth through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. Calculating available equity involves subtracting the current mortgage balance from the home's market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at about 80% of the total equity.
