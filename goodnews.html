          <p>Australians are participating in a general election, choosing between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party and opposition leader Peter Dutton amidst economic challenges and a shifting global landscape. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, despite both parties offering only small-scale solutions. The election also reflects a broader trend of voters moving away from major parties towards independent candidates, signaling dissatisfaction with traditional politics. This New York Times article highlights the key issues and political dynamics shaping the Australian election, including comparisons to President Trump's policies and the impact of global turmoil.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes, offering potential for a universal antivenom. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's antibodies target common elements in toxins, and this article from the BBC details how researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies effective against neurotoxins, creating a cocktail that saved mice from fatal venom doses, marking a significant step toward a universal snakebite therapy.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to weaken the local currency, which had strengthened against the US dollar due to increased capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially driving further capital into Hong Kong. This article from the South China Morning Post explains how the HKMA aims to maintain orderly money and foreign exchange markets amid these economic pressures.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing significant administrative reforms aimed at reducing government spending, modernizing the state, and consolidating political power under the Communist Party. Led by new party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. This article from DW examines how these changes, expected to cut 15% of the bureaucracy, also address dysfunction caused by anti-corruption efforts and prepare Vietnam for external economic pressures. The restructuring is occurring ahead of the 14th National Congress in 2026, where To Lam is a leading contender for reappointment.</p>
