          <p>England winger Lauren James has responded to criticism she received during Euro 2025, stating that fans were "too quick to judge" her performances. James revealed that she played through injury during the tournament, which affected her form, and also expressed her fear of racist abuse after missing a penalty. She emphasized that fans are often unaware of the challenges players face and should be mindful of their comments. Despite the criticism, James affirmed her commitment to representing England and her desire to continue playing for her country.</p>

          <p>Abi Burton, an England rugby player, made her Rugby World Cup debut after a remarkable recovery from autoimmune encephalitis, a rare condition that caused her body's immune system to attack her brain. Three years prior, she was in a coma for nearly four weeks, having lost the ability to walk, talk, read, or write. After a year of intensive rehabilitation, she signed with Trailfinders Women and joined the Great Britain Sevens team for Paris. Burton's journey is a testament to her resilience and determination, inspiring many with her return to elite sport.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than anticipated in the second quarter of the year, growing by 1.8% year over year, surpassing economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by domestic spending, including household and government consumption. While global uncertainty did not significantly impact the economy in the second quarter, some analysts suggest it may be a high point for growth in 2025. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates by 25 basis points in August and acknowledged increased clarity regarding U.S. tariffs and policy responses, but reduced its economic growth forecast for the year to 1.7%.

          <p>China is experiencing an early-stage branding supercycle as Chinese brands gain global recognition and trust. The Labubu craze, exemplified by Pop Mart's success, demonstrates that being from China is no longer synonymous with being cheap. This brand muscle is extending into industries such as batteries, cars, drones, and biotech, with Chinese companies competing on trust as much as on hardware. The rise of CATL batteries, featured in Xiaomi cars, further illustrates the shift from cost advantage to brand advantage in the Chinese business mindset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Keir Starmer, has challenged the government's plan to limit a civil service internship scheme to students from working-class backgrounds. Gray questioned the evidence base behind the decision, arguing that she learned from being around people from different walks of life. The government argued that the change will bring in more working-class young people, but Gray expressed concern about limiting exposure to a wider group. The move highlights ongoing debates about diversity and inclusion in the civil service.</p>
