          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator for NASA. This decision follows the withdrawal of the previous nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, whose nomination was pulled shortly before a scheduled Senate vote. The White House cited a review of Isaacman's past political donations and professional associations with Elon Musk's SpaceX as reasons for the change. Duffy's temporary appointment comes at a critical time for the space agency as it pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and future missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures to cool down Seoul's overheating housing market. The Bank of Korea noted a significant acceleration in housing prices and household debt, prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth stimulation. This hold follows a rate cut in May, which occurred during a period of political uncertainty and trade pressures from the U.S. The central bank is now focused on managing risks associated with the housing sector and potential volatility in foreign exchange markets.

          <p>Two men have been arrested in what Minnesota authorities are calling one of the largest methamphetamine seizures in the state's history. Law enforcement confiscated nearly 900 pounds of the suspected drug, valued at approximately $1.7 million, during two traffic stops. The arrests of Joel Casas-Santiago and Guillermo Mercado Chaparro followed an undercover operation and surveillance. Investigators believe the men are connected to a larger drug trafficking organization based in Mexico, highlighting ongoing efforts by federal and local agencies to dismantle large-scale narcotics operations within the United States.</p>

          <p>The family of Army Reservist Sgt. Kennedy Sanders, who was killed in a drone attack in Jordan, has received her lost cellphone containing cherished, unseen memories. Her parents had presumed the phone was destroyed in the blast, but it was discovered months later by a staff sergeant at the base. After charging the phone, he was able to find the family's contact information and return it just before Mother's Day.

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services, most notably trash collection. The 9,000 striking workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, had walked off the job seeking higher wages. The new three-year contract reportedly includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, a figure significantly lower than the union's initial demands. With the agreement in place, workers have returned to their jobs, and the city has begun the task of cleaning up the accumulated trash.</p>
