          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, has won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year. Despite a moment of overconfidence where he began spelling a word incorrectly, he recovered to spell the winning word, ‚Äúeclaircissement,‚Äù correctly. Zaki's victory marks the 100th anniversary of the bee, and he is celebrated for his passion and enthusiasm for spelling. He plans to donate a portion of his $77,500 winnings to charity and is known for studying archaic words beyond the competition's scope.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn F√©in leader, has won a libel case against the BBC over a story alleging he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson.

Adams denies any involvement in Donaldson's murder and stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable. The BBC expressed disappointment, asserting they defended their journalism, while Adams' solicitor highlighted the false allegation's prolonged online presence.</p>

          <p>U.S. airlines are competing to provide the best business-class experience, with new suites, sliding doors, and enhanced amenities. American Airlines is introducing upgraded business-class "suites" on its Boeing Dreamliners, while United Airlines is adding "Polaris Studios" with ottomans and larger screens. These upgrades are aimed at attracting more customers to pay for premium seats. Delta Air Lines has also opened a dedicated lounge for its highest-tier customers.</p>

          <p>Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is on track to receive bonuses worth more than ‚Ç¨100m after Ryanair shares closed above ‚Ç¨21 for 28 consecutive days. This meets a key performance target for the company. O'Leary will have the option to receive 10 million shares worth approximately ‚Ç¨111.2m, provided he remains with the airline until the end of July 2028. He has been with Ryanair since 1988 and has spearheaded the airline's growth into Europe's largest low-cost carrier.</p>
