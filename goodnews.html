          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic rebound, positioning it to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. New listing volumes surged to $14 billion in the first half of 2025, an eightfold increase from the same period last year, driven by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. This revival is fueled by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on the mainland, and delisting fears from U.S. markets. High-profile listings like battery maker CATL have highlighted the renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration executive order that suspended the ability of migrants crossing the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the White House cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system." The judge granted a class-action status to all people affected by the order but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal. Civil rights groups praised the ruling as a critical defense of established U.S. law.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for menopause hormone therapy may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55. Conversely, the research showed that using estrogen-only therapy, typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines earlier findings and underscores that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Health experts emphasize that women should consult their doctors to weigh the personal risks and benefits of such treatments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Pew Research Center study showing President Trump garnered 48% of the Latino vote in 2024 has prompted analysis on the community's evolving political alignment. Political experts suggest the shift is not an ideological move to conservatism but rather a turn toward populism driven by economic anxieties and disillusionment with the Democratic Party. Analysts point to frustration over immigration policies and a perception that Democrats have neglected a working-class agenda. The surprise primary win of socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City is cited as further evidence that this voter bloc responds to populist messaging from either side.</p>

          <p>Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne is set to perform one last time with his original Black Sabbath bandmates at a farewell show in their hometown of Birmingham. The 76-year-old frontman, known for his wild stage antics and decades of rock-and-roll excess, has faced numerous health issues in recent years, including Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. The concert, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being hailed as a major event for heavy metal, featuring influential bands like Metallica and Slayer. Despite previous retirement teases, this performance is widely expected to be his true swansong.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a trade agreement that sets a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, avoiding a much higher 46% levy threatened by President Trump. Under the deal, Vietnam will not charge any tariffs on U.S. products, giving American goods full access to its markets. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a practice the administration has sought to curb. The deal provides some relief for companies that have moved manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid U.S.-China trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, Cramer noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low benefits U.S.-based multinational consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble, by making their exports more competitive on the global market.
