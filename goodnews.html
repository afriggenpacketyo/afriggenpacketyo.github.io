        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to consult on a massive compensation scheme for drivers who were mis-sold car loans, with potential costs estimated between £9 billion and £18 billion. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that particularly large commissions could create an unfair relationship between lender and borrower. The FCA stated the ruling provides clarity and that it will now determine eligibility for the payout scheme, which could begin next year. Most individuals are expected to receive less than £950, with the regulator advising consumers to contact their loan providers directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former "Bachelor" stars Sean and Catherine Lowe have voiced their concerns about the widespread use of Ozempic for weight loss, describing the trend as "triggering" and "hard to watch." In an interview, the couple advocated for a more sustainable and healthier approach to wellness, emphasizing consistency in fitness and nutrition over quick fixes. They shared their personal strategy, which involves regular exercise and mindful eating habits developed in partnership with Atkins. The Lowes believe that while their method requires more time and commitment, it ultimately leads to a healthier overall lifestyle compared to what they see as the risky and restrictive nature of the Ozempic craze.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will update an exhibit at the National Museum of American History to accurately reflect all presidential impeachment proceedings, including those of Donald Trump. The statement followed reports that a placard detailing Trump's two impeachments had been removed in July from "The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden" exhibit. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the temporary placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official. The museum affirmed its responsibility to present complete histories and stated the impeachment section will be updated in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>A new report from HR technology company Checkr has identified the top U.S. cities for employment and earnings, with mid-sized metro areas like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin taking the lead. The study challenges the traditional dominance of major coastal hubs like New York and Los Angeles, which did not make the top 10. The ranking was based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, personal income, and the percentage of high-earning households. Researchers suggest this shift indicates that opportunity is spreading to more affordable cities where strong wages can go further, highlighting a changing economic landscape for American workers.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that specific language can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums by fostering connection over control. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate their emotions and help calm their nervous system. The approach emphasizes that tantrums are a sign of distress, not defiance. By providing reassurance and setting boundaries with compassion, parents can help children feel safe, which reduces the intensity of meltdowns and builds long-term emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. The scheme, which could be operational within weeks, reportedly aims to allow up to 300 young people into the country for free medical care, accompanied by a parent or guardian. This official initiative follows criticism from a Foreign Affairs Committee report and the efforts of private organizations like Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three Gazan children to the UK for treatment. The move signals a shift in government policy to provide direct medical aid to children affected by the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to adopt principles of extreme saving and frugal living to exit the workforce decades ahead of schedule. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and the book "Your Money or Your Life," centers on saving a significant portion of one's income to build an investment portfolio large enough to live off its returns. Adherents focus on distinguishing needs from wants and maximizing their savings rate, often aiming to accumulate 25 times their annual expenses. This approach allows them to reclaim their time for personal passions, family, and causes they care about.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently admitted that he does not know his exact net worth and prefers not to focus on it. Instead, he concentrates on building a portfolio of investments and opportunities he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day financial management to a professional team. Financial planners say this approach can be beneficial, as it allows individuals to prioritize their passions and long-term goals over fixating on a single number. Experts suggest that focusing on cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal values can lead to greater financial well-being than simply chasing a higher net worth.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the decade-long process behind creating CHSN01, a high-strength cryogenic steel designed for use in nuclear fusion reactors. The material was developed to solve a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after existing materials proved too brittle. The new steel must withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium (near absolute zero) and the immense magnetic forces generated inside the reactor. The successful creation and deployment of CHSN01 in the world's first fusion power generation reactor this year marks a significant advancement for China in materials science.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old co-founder and CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's successful stock market debut. Field, a 2012 Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University, saw Figma's valuation soar to over $71 billion, making his personal stake worth approximately $6.6 billion. The IPO was a major event for Silicon Valley, which has seen few high-profile debuts recently. The company's journey included turning down a $20 billion acquisition offer from Adobe in 2023 after facing regulatory hurdles, a decision that has now paid off with its strong public offering.</p>
