          <h2>American Eagle Outfitters Becomes Latest Meme Stock Following Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:18:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged, positioning it as the newest company to be targeted by meme stock traders. The rally appears to be driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who are attracted to the stock's high short interest. This phenomenon, which can cause volatile price swings as short-sellers cover their positions, has recently affected other brands. The renewed interest in American Eagle coincides with the launch of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, focusing on the brand's denim line. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has made a remarkable return to his best bowling form, taking his first five-wicket haul in a Test match since 2017. This achievement comes after a challenging period of recovery from knee and hamstring surgeries that had cast doubt on his ability to bowl again. His performance in the current series against India has been pivotal, with his pace and skill reminiscent of his earlier career. Stokes has become England's leading wicket-taker in the series, showcasing a successful rehabilitation and a renewed impact as a key all-rounder.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize the state of Palestine in September at the United Nations General Assembly. The decision, which Macron described as true to France's commitment to peace in the Middle East, makes it one of the most powerful European nations to take this step. The announcement comes amid a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and follows a breakdown in US-led ceasefire negotiations. This move signals growing international frustration with the ongoing conflict and a push for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested and charged with receiving stolen property in connection with a major theft of Pokémon cards and collectibles. The items, valued at over $113,000, were stolen during a smash-and-grab burglary at a collectibles shop earlier in the month. The suspect was apprehended after he allegedly attempted to sell some of the rare stolen items, including a booster box valued at $30,000. A subsequent search of an apartment linked to the suspect uncovered more of the stolen, high-value graded cards.</p>

          <p>A viral claim that the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" predicted a recent Coldplay concert kiss cam incident has been found to be false. Social media posts circulated a screenshot from the show alongside the real video, but fact-checkers determined the cartoon image was likely generated by artificial intelligence or otherwise manipulated. While the show is famous for its seemingly prescient jokes about future events, many supposed predictions are misattributed or fabricated. The show's creator has stated that any accurate predictions are unintentional coincidences resulting from decades of writing absurd jokes.</p>

          <p>Actress Molly Gordon, known for supporting roles in projects like "The Bear," has taken a more direct role in shaping her career by co-writing and producing her first film lead in "Oh, Hi!". Frustrated by a lack of starring opportunities, Gordon helped create the role of Iris, a character she describes as emotional and unhinged, in the unconventional romantic comedy. The film, which also stars Logan Lerman, follows a couple whose relationship is tested in an extreme way. Gordon's move reflects a growing trend of actors creating their own material to showcase their range.</p>

          <p>Honeywell's stock fell despite the company reporting strong second-quarter results that beat expectations for revenue, organic sales, and earnings per share. The industrial conglomerate also raised its full-year guidance for these key metrics, signaling confidence in its performance. The negative market reaction was partly attributed to a disappointing segment margin outlook, driven by increased R&D spending. Management is proceeding with plans to split the company into three separate publicly traded entities, with the advanced materials business expected to be spun off first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article traces the cyclical popularity of facial hair in Western culture, from its widespread acceptance in the post-Civil War era to its decline in the clean-shaven 20th century. Beards and mustaches were once associated with presidents but later became symbols of counter-culture or specific professions. The piece notes the "cringe-ification" of the mustache during the 2010s hipster trend, followed by its current resurgence as a common accessory for men, including prominent politicians. The author reflects on this history through their own personal journey with growing and shaving facial hair.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is revising a controversial law concerning the country's anti-corruption authorities after it sparked significant public protests in Kiev. Demonstrators were angered by new legislation that placed anti-corruption bodies under the control of the General Prosecutor's Office, which they saw as a threat to their independence. After signing the initial law, Zelensky has now backed down, promising a new draft that will ensure the independence of these crucial institutions. He discussed the revised legislation with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, inviting German expertise to help review the new bill.</p>
