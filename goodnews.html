          <p>Pittsburgh Pirates star Oneil Cruz was taken out of a game by manager Don Kelly after failing to run out a double-play grounder, citing a lack of energy and effort. Cruz admitted he lost track of the outs in the situation, leading to his mistake. This incident follows a recent outfield blunder and a slump at the plate for Cruz, who is batting .156 this month. Cruz maintained that his issue on the basepaths had nothing to do with his slump at the plate.</p>
