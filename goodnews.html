          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 11:31:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to halt proceedings in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued DOGE for public access to its records and plans for government overhaul. The administration claims executive privilege, asserting that DOGE, as a presidential advisory board, is exempt from FOIA. The Solicitor General argues that depositions and document production would expose private executive branch information, undermining the purpose of the litigation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has increased interest in alternative stores of value. The price of Bitcoin has been steadily climbing in May, fueled by corporate momentum and adoption by Wall Street. Inflows into ETFs tracking Bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion, with minimal outflows. On-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market, as measured by Tether stablecoin USDT on exchanges. (not investment advice)</p>

Intense battles occurred on the Italian peninsula from 1943 to 1945, with approximately 72,000 American servicemembers still unaccounted for from the war worldwide.

          <p>The FDA is planning a major policy shift, potentially limiting COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with high-risk conditions, requiring vaccine makers to conduct lengthy, placebo-controlled trials for broader use. FDA officials argue that annual boosters may not be worth the risk for healthy individuals without updated clinical trial data. Experts caution that lengthy trials could result in vaccines ineffective against current variants. This change aligns with recommendations from other countries like the U.K., Canada, and Australia, sparking debate on the necessity of annual boosters for young, healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix, known for its grandeur and iconic status, is facing discussions about whether it has become a stagnant track. The narrow streets and tight turns make overtaking difficult, leading to predictable race classifications.

This year, the top 10 remained unchanged from start to finish with only four overtakes in the 78-lap contest.</p>
