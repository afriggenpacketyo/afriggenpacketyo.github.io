          <h2>German Chancellor States Europe Must Increase Its Own Defense Contributions</h2>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have been "free-riders" on U.S. defense spending in the past but asserts that they are now increasing their contributions. In a BBC interview, Merz stated that Russia's war in Ukraine serves as a significant threat to European peace and freedom, necessitating greater military investment. He is working to boost defense ties with the UK and France, forming a triangular alliance to focus on security and economic growth. Merz noted that while he and President Trump are coordinating on Ukraine, the U.S. is turning its focus to Asia, reinforcing the need for European self-reliance.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in marches and rallies across all 50 U.S. states to protest the Trump administration and honor the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. The "Good Trouble Lives On" events, held on the fifth anniversary of the late congressman's death, advocated for voting rights and social justice. Organizers demanded an end to administration policies they say target minority groups and slash social programs. The protests, inspired by Lewis's call to make "good trouble, necessary trouble," included voter registration drives, teach-ins, and vigils across more than 1,500 locations.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone Capable of Vertical Take-Off and Landing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Its design, which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, allows for high-speed flight without the need for a runway, offering significant deployment flexibility. The drone's intelligent control system also demonstrated autonomous capabilities like route planning and threat avoidance.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to begin producing its signature soda with real cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. While the company has yet to formally confirm the specifics, the move is seen as a political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement championed by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, the article notes that public health experts view the two sweeteners as having nearly identical metabolic effects. The change is largely seen as a move to appease a consumer preference for the taste of "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be up to 1.5 million years old has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK, where scientists will melt it to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that can reveal information about temperature, wind patterns, and atmospheric composition from a previously unknown period. Researchers hope the data will help them understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles and provide insights into how Earth responds to high concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly driven by a slowdown in rice price increases after the government released stockpiles, though prices remain elevated. Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. The data comes as the nation faces economic growth concerns due to potential U.S. tariffs, making the cost of living a key issue for upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shoppers in the UK using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Klarna will face stricter affordability checks under new regulations set to take effect next July. The rules, introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority, aim to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt and will likely result in some shoppers being denied this form of credit. The changes will bring the currently unregulated BNPL sector more in line with other types of lending, requiring clear information on fees, faster refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing bruising on his hand. A physician's note described the condition as benign and common for individuals over 70, stating there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The bruising was attributed to tissue damage from frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, with the president's overall health described as excellent.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver and former USC star Jordan Addison has resolved his 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge of reckless driving. Addison was arrested after being found asleep at the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed, and he will avoid jail time. Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation, a fine, and must complete two online courses, allowing him to put the incident behind him and focus on his NFL career.</p>
