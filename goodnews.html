          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to the potential presence of undeclared milk allergens. The recall includes six lots of semi-sweet chocolate with "Christmas Seeds" colored nonpareils and 15 lots of semi-sweet chocolate with white nonpareils, with the FDA warning that consumption of these products could pose a risk of serious allergic reactions for individuals with milk allergies or sensitivities. The company initiated the recall after a wholesale customer complaint led to a lab test confirming the presence of milk, and while no illnesses have been reported, Weaver Nut Company is collaborating with the FDA to ensure product safety.

          <p>Tensions flared during a game between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels when Astros pitcher Hunter Brown hit Angels shortstop Zach Neto with a pitch, leading to a heated confrontation and a bench-clearing incident.

          <p>UBS has maintained a 'Hold' rating for Conagra Brands, Inc., citing growth pressures and an anticipated decrease in earnings per share by fiscal year 2026, although these concerns are largely factored into the company's current valuation. Conagra's financial stability is supported by a 6.49% dividend yield and 14% free cash flow yield, which balances its risk-to-reward profile, and the company has streamlined its portfolio by selling its Chef Boyardee and Van de Kam‚Äôs brands. Conagra Brands recently launched 50 new frozen food items, demonstrating its commitment to aligning with evolving consumer preferences and boasts a well-established portfolio including Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Slim Jim.

          <p>Face yoga, a trendy facial workout involving exaggerated poses and repetitive movements, is gaining popularity for its potential slimming and anti-aging effects, but experts offer mixed opinions on its effectiveness. While some influencers claim it can provide a natural facelift, toning, and reduce fine lines, a dermatologist and the author of a face yoga study suggest it may improve facial fullness and circulation, but is not a replacement for cosmetic procedures. Face yoga could also help relax facial muscles and increase blood flow, but generally, face yoga exercises are harmless, and those seeking more dramatic interventions should consult a dermatologist.
