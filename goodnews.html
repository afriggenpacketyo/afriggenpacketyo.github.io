          <p>Alibaba founder Jack Ma made a surprise appearance at the company's annual AliDay event in Hangzhou, visiting a replica of the flat where Alibaba was founded, which boosted employee morale amid strategic repositioning at the company. Ma's visit, during which he toured the campus and attended a music show, generated excitement among employees, who see him as the company's spiritual leader and largest shareholder. The replica flat displayed a quote from Deng Xiaoping, and employees paid homage, reflecting on the company's entrepreneurial beginnings and reigniting memories of Alibaba's early days and its rapid growth. The event was held to honor family members for their support of employees across various Alibaba offices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer prominent in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next U.S. Surgeon General, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Means, a former surgeon turned metabolic health advocate, will work alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to address chronic diseases and improve American health. She co-founded Levels, an app for tracking food and biometric data, and co-authored "Good Energy," a book examining American health issues. Means' views align with Kennedy's, focusing on improving the food supply and expressing vaccine skepticism, although there is no evidence to suggest that childhood vaccines or the current CDC vaccine schedule are unsafe.</p>

          <p>A secret menu hack at McDonald's, the "Cotton Candy Sprite," is gaining popularity on social media, which involves ordering a medium Sprite with three pumps of French vanilla syrup. Customers can only order this item in person, and while some are intrigued by the flavor combination, others express skepticism or disappointment. Some commenters compare the taste to cream soda rather than cotton candy, and some express doubt about the chain's ability to fulfill the order, citing the chain's infamously broken milkshake machines. This isn't the first time a secret menu item at McDonald's has sparked a viral conversation, as the "Land, Air & Sea" sandwich gained traction in 2022.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging "The Central Park Five," an opera by Anthony Davis that won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2020, focusing on the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of five Black and brown teenagers in 1989. The opera also includes Donald Trump, who in 1989, took out full-page newspaper ads demanding the death penalty for the teenagers, and the opera presents the aria in a less incendiary manner, focusing on the lives of the wrongly accused men. Director Nataki Garrett emphasizes that the opera is about the lives and journeys of these men, and how they have positively impacted their communities, at a moment when stories about race and power are being politicized.</p>

          <p>Forensic testing has linked skull remains found in 1993 to Kay Josephine Medin, a woman missing since 1987 from Trinity County, Northern California, thanks to third-party forensic testing and a federal grant. The remains were discovered along the shoreline of Trinidad Head, and the identification was made possible through genome sequencing by Othram, a Texas-based forensic laboratory, and after contacting the daughter of the missing woman. Medin's disappearance was classified as a cold case homicide, and while the identification provides a new clue, no suspects have ever been charged. Rep. Jared Huffman credited the community project grant for helping to clear the backlog of cold cases and bring closure to the community.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to create a National Warrior Independence Center for homeless veterans on the West Los Angeles VA campus, aiming to house up to 6,000 veterans. The order directs federal agencies to redirect funds from housing or services for "illegal aliens" to support the center's construction and maintenance, and Secretary Doug Collins is tasked with preparing an action plan by January 1, 2028. The order comes amid litigation over the VA's management of the campus, and while veterans express cautious optimism, some argue that the master plan envisions more than just housing, including services and community development. The order also calls for accountability and expansion of the Manchester VA Medical Center in New Hampshire.</p>

          <p>Farmers in California's "salad bowl" are investing in guest worker housing due to an aging local farmworker population and the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented workers, turning to the federal H-2A visa program. Monterey County growers have privately funded at least eight housing complexes for thousands of guest workers, which are modern multi-family townhomes with recreational areas and laundry facilities, though some community members raise concerns about the impact on local farmworkers. While the H-2A program is not without its critics, it is seen as a solution to stabilize the labor supply amid potential mass deportations, and it also boosts the overall housing supply and supports the local economy.</p>

          <p>The remote Northern California town of Bolinas is set to reopen its post office by Fall 2025 after being without one for over two years due to a dispute between the USPS and its landlord. Residents, who rely on the post office for mail delivery and social interaction, rallied with creative protests, including picketing, parades, and letter-writing campaigns, to push for its reopening. The victory is seen as significant given President Trump's considerations of privatizing the Postal Service, and Representative Jared Huffman criticized the lengthy process and bureaucracy involved. The new postmaster general is David Steiner, a board member for FedEx, a direct USPS competitor.</p>

The company is also consolidating its corporate office back to Baldwin Park, where it first opened, and while expansion outside California helps prevent cannibalization of sales, it also allows the company to reach California expats in other regions.</p>

          <p>Maintaining friendships can be challenging after having children, but communication and compassion are key to preserving these relationships, regardless of whether friends have kids or not. Common challenges include assumptions about availability, exclusion from conversations, and inflexibility regarding activities.

Addressing difficult conversations directly can strengthen bonds, while recognizing that friendships may evolve naturally over time, as it's ok to recognize we're not the same people we used to be.</p>

Google has said the changes align with its policy of following official United States government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).
