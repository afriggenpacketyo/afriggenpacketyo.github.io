          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy veteran who lost a hand and leg in a 2009 shark attack, has shared his top survival tips for ocean encounters. He advises people to remain calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract a shark's attention. De Gelder also recommends maintaining eye contact with the shark, as they prefer to attack unseen targets from behind. As a final measure, he suggests pushing the shark firmly on the nose rather than punching it. His advice comes amid recent shark sightings along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A nearly 14-foot, 1,653-pound adult male great white shark named "Contender" has been detected off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The shark, tagged by the marine research group Ocearch, is the largest Atlantic great white currently being tracked by the organization. Its tracking device "pinged" when its dorsal fin surfaced, transmitting its location as it continues its northward migration. Originally tagged off the Florida-Georgia border, Contender has been tracked traveling over a thousand miles up the U.S. East Coast, providing valuable data on great white migration patterns.</p>

His rise is viewed by many as a sign of growing political power and representation for communities that have faced racism and Islamophobia, particularly in post-9/11 New York.

          <p>With college costs steadily rising, many students rely on federal loans, but these come with specific borrowing limits that may not cover the full cost of attendance. The maximum amount a student can borrow depends on their dependency status, year in school, and whether they are an undergraduate or graduate student. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500 annually. When these limits are reached, this article suggests that students may need to explore other options, such as private student loans, to bridge the remaining financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza CEO Russell Weiner stated that current economic headwinds in the restaurant industry are creating an opportunity for the company to gain market share. The chain reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, crediting its success to value-focused promotions that are attracting customers across all income levels, including frugal diners. Weiner contrasted Domino's strategy of offering deals on popular items with competitors who he claims discount less desirable products. The approach appears to be resonating as consumers increasingly prioritize value and choose to eat at home more often.</p>

When asked directly, the university officials all affirmed that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination is a form of antisemitism. The author contends this clarity is long overdue, as it distinguishes legitimate criticism of Israeli policy from anti-Zionism, which singles out the Jewish state for elimination.
