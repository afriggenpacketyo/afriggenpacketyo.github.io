          <h2>Monarch Butterflies Find Unexpected Sanctuary in New York City</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Monarch butterflies are remarkably thriving in New York City, defying national population declines, thanks to widespread urban gardening efforts focused on native milkweed and wildflowers. The article details how small patches of green in places like Brooklyn Bridge Park and community gardens provide crucial breeding and feeding grounds for these iconic insects. This urban conservation success, driven by both official programs and "guerrilla gardeners," illustrates the significant impact localized initiatives can have on supporting wildlife. It offers an optimistic model for environmental action, showing that even in densely populated areas, nature can flourish with targeted human intervention.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed a profit-sharing agreement between the U.S. and Japan for American-based projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment. Under the deal, profits will be split 50/50 until Japan recoups its initial investment, then shift to a 90/10 split favoring the U.S. This arrangement is designed to stimulate U.S. domestic manufacturing, focusing on areas like nuclear power and antibiotics, while offering Japan the benefit of lower tariffs. Lutnick suggested the deal would not ultimately cost Japanese taxpayers, assuming project returns cover the investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry made an unannounced visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, to offer support to wounded service members, his second such trip since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. As the founder of the Invictus Games, he highlighted the importance of aiding the recovery process for military veterans. His visit coincided with the British Foreign Secretary's trip, which saw the announcement of new UK sanctions targeting Russia's oil revenues and military supplies. This show of solidarity comes after Harry's recent meeting with King Charles III, suggesting a possible improvement in his relationship with the royal family.</p>

          <p>The European Union has accepted Microsoft's pledges to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular productivity software, averting a significant antitrust fine. This agreement, which makes Microsoft's commitments binding for at least seven years, requires the company to offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams at a reduced price. It also mandates allowing customers to switch licenses and ensuring interoperability with competing products. The decision resolves an antitrust investigation initiated after a complaint from Salesforce-owned Slack, aiming to foster greater competition in the workplace communication market.</p>

          <p>Colorado and several other Democratic-led states are proactively revising their vaccine policies and seeking scientific consensus from non-federal sources. This comes amid growing concerns that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is eroding public trust in federal health guidance. Colorado has notably amended laws to allow consultation with leading medical groups for school vaccine requirements and issued standing orders enabling pharmacists to administer COVID shots without individual prescriptions. This significant shift underscores a concerted state-level effort to protect immunization access and public health science from political interference.</p>
