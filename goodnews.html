          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:15:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, which propelled the cryptocurrency's price upward. The rally was also supported by a wave of short liquidations, where traders betting against bitcoin were forced to buy back, further increasing its price. Analysts suggest that expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential fiscal policies are contributing to the positive sentiment in the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After an absence of more than four years due to injury, fast bowler Jofra Archer made a spectacular return to Test cricket for England against India at Lord's. In his very first over, Archer showcased his signature pace and skill, dismissing Indian opener Yashasvi Jaiswal with just his third delivery. His initial spell was electrifying, reaching speeds over 93 mph and demonstrating the high-impact talent England has been missing. While questions remain about his long-term durability, his immediate performance has reinvigorated the English attack and provided a moment of pure joy for the player and fans.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that TikTok intentionally designs its platform with manipulative and addictive features to exploit young users, thereby increasing their exposure to ads and prompting purchases. The state's Attorney General, John Formella, praised the decision as a crucial step toward holding the company accountable for practices that endanger children. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states targeting the design elements of tech platforms rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final after a commanding straight-sets victory over seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. Sinner's dominant performance prevented Djokovic from securing a record 25th Grand Slam title, with the 38-year-old Serbian star acknowledging that age and physical wear are catching up to him. The win sets up a highly anticipated final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, a rematch of their recent five-set epic at the French Open. This marks the sixth consecutive Grand Slam final to feature either Sinner or Alcaraz, highlighting their current dominance in men's tennis.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions on journalists covering protests. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations following incidents where reporters were allegedly targeted during demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The order specifically bars police from using such crowd-control tools against journalists who are not posing an imminent threat. The judge cited clear evidence of reporters being hit, underscoring the need to protect 1st Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabins, such as business and first class, mirroring the strategy it applied to its main economy cabin. The airline, which pioneered fare types like basic economy, sees an opportunity to offer more varied products to high-end customers, whose demand has remained strong. Delta President Glen Hauenstein suggested the template of main cabin segmentation could be applied to premium offerings, potentially creating different tiers of service or amenities. While details are not yet public, the move reflects a focus on maximizing revenue from the front of the plane, where profit margins have been expanding.</p>

          <h2>US Treasury Reports Unexpected June Surplus Boosted by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:54:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the deficit in May, largely driven by a surge in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall increase in government receipts. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion, with net interest on the national debt remaining a major expense. The figures highlight the financial impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies on government revenue, even as overall federal debt continues to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article posits that the current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' serves as an insightful look into the dating habits of Generation Z. Despite its popularity, the season has been criticized for a lack of genuine romantic connections, with contestants often appearing emotionally guarded and hesitant to form deep bonds. The author argues this reflects a broader trend among Gen Z, a cohort with less relationship experience that often favors non-committal "situationships" and fears appearing overly eager. The show's most popular contestants are those who defy this trend by openly expressing their strong emotions, suggesting viewers crave authentic vulnerability.</p>

          <p>Mayor Karen Bass has announced a new program to provide direct cash assistance to individuals and families in Los Angeles affected by the Trump administration's recent immigration raids. The aid will be distributed via cash cards, funded by philanthropic partners rather than city money, and handed out by immigrant rights groups. This initiative is part of a broader city response that includes an executive order to strengthen L.A.'s sanctuary city policies, which limit municipal cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The city is also seeking records from ICE regarding the details of the raids conducted since early June.</p>
