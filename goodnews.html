          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goals in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The oral GLP-1 treatment led to an average weight loss of 10.5% (22.9 pounds) over 72 weeks and significantly improved blood sugar levels, with most patients no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. This development positions the pill as a convenient, needle-free alternative in the growing weight loss market, potentially expanding access due to easier manufacturing and no dietary restrictions. While side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, led to some discontinuations, the overall efficacy is considered very good for this patient population, paving the way for global regulatory approvals.</p>

          <p>St. Louis Cardinals star Willson Contreras was ejected from Monday night's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates after an angry outburst at home plate umpire Derek Thomas following a strikeout. Contreras, who claimed he only asked the umpire to call pitches consistently, was held back by coaches but threw his bat in the direction of first base coach Brant Brown. Crew chief Jordan Baker reported that Contreras and manager Oliver Marmol used "vulgar stuff" and that Contreras made contact with the umpire. Contreras later apologized to Coach Brown for the incident, which occurred during the Cardinals' 7-6 victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Katrina in 2005 highlighted the critical need to include pets in disaster planning, as tens of thousands were left behind and many owners refused to evacuate without them. The heartbreaking images and stories led to the 2006 PETS Act, incentivizing states to integrate animal welfare into emergency protocols. This article emphasizes that saving pets also saves humans, as nearly half of those who didn't evacuate during Katrina cited their animals as the reason. While progress has been made, experts like Randy Covey and Cesar Perea stress the ongoing need for individuals to be prepared to take their pets, as shelters cannot accommodate all animals.</p>

          <p>Ojai's historic Hotel El Roblar, originally built in 1919, has reopened after years of restoration, aiming to evoke Old California charm while offering a luxurious escape. The 2-acre property features 39 guest rooms, 11 bungalows, two restaurants, and unique amenities like Aldabra giant tortoises on loan from the Turtle Conservancy. The redesign emphasizes rustic elegance and local history, avoiding trendy aesthetics. The hotel's rebirth, led by a team including entrepreneur Eric Goode, marks its first time being openly accessible to the community in 50 years, despite some local debate over changes like the removal of public parking.</p>

The project, partly funded by a Lawn to Garden rebate, aims to be ocean-friendly and community-welcoming, featuring a low fence and a water dish for passing dogs. This personal story highlights a successful shift towards sustainable living and community engagement in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) has launched a new campaign asking mobile users to wear headphones and avoid playing music or making calls on loudspeakers on public transport. Research indicates 70% of passengers find such "disruptive behavior" a nuisance, with some experiencing it as stressful. Posters will appear on the Elizabeth line and other services, reinforcing TfL by-laws that already prohibit loud audio without permission. Enforcement officers typically ask offenders to stop, with refusal potentially leading to removal or prosecution. The campaign addresses a growing issue exacerbated by expanded 4G/5G coverage on the Tube.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a locked guesthouse room in Sichuan province. Realizing the door's malfunction and lacking her phone, she resorted to biting her finger and writing "110 625" (emergency number and room number) in blood on a pillow, which she then threw from her sixth-floor window. A food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the desperate message and immediately alerted police, who successfully kicked open the door. Zhang was awarded 3,000 yuan for his quick thinking, turning a terrifying ordeal into a successful rescue story.</p>

          <p>China has launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, now the world's largest detector for elusive "ghost particles" called neutrinos. The massive facility has begun collecting data, with its 20,000-tonne liquid scintillator detector, housed 700 meters underground, successfully filled. Juno's mission is to measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by nearby nuclear power plants. Particle physicist Wang Yifang hailed the data collection start as a "historic milestone" for the international project, proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008, marking a significant advancement in particle physics research.</p>
