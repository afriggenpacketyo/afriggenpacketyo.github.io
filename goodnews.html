          <p>Honda has successfully tested a reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, Japan, marking its first successful landing after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters. The carmaker aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, leveraging technologies from its existing product development and automated driving systems. Honda stated it has not yet decided on commercializing the technology, but it sees potential for launching satellites that could enhance its existing business operations. The company anticipates growing demand for satellite launch rockets due to the increasing need for data systems in outer space.</p>
