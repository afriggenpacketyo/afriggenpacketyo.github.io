        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would lift all sanctions against Syria to foster stability and peace, marking a significant shift after over a decade of sanctions imposed due to the Assad regime's actions. Trump highlighted the new Syrian government's potential for stabilizing the country following the toppling of the Assad regime by anti-Assad militia groups in December of 2024. The move aims to facilitate economic progress and humanitarian aid, which had been severely hampered by the sanctions, particularly after the devastating 2023 earthquake. Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda member now leading the transitional government, hopes this will mark a new beginning for Syria.</p>

          <p>A Reddit discussion reveals varying opinions on vaping in airplane bathrooms, with many users claiming to be flight attendants stating that it is easily detected due to smoke detectors and sensors throughout the plane. Travel expert Gary Leff confirms that modern smoke detectors can detect aerosols from vaping, and the FAA prohibits vaping under the same regulations as smoking. Some passengers admitted to vaping discreetly in their seats, while others recounted incidents where fire alarms were triggered. The consensus is that vaping on planes is against the rules and can lead to arrest.</p>

China is emphasizing self-sufficiency and national security, potentially impacting foreign entities, while continuing to diversify its trade relationships. The U.S.-China Business Council urges China to end unfair trade practices, but experts expect the largest trading relationship in the world to continue.</p>

          <p>The European Union's second-highest court ruled that the bloc should have released text messages exchanged between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO during negotiations for a coronavirus vaccine. The New York Times brought the case against the European Commission, arguing that the commission's refusal to release the text messages raised questions about transparency and accountability in negotiations that cost taxpayers money and shaped public policy. The court stated that the commission failed to explain why the text messages did not contain important information. The ruling could set a legal precedent for what is considered an official document in the EU and could impact the European Commission's reputation for disclosure.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and budget cuts, are injecting uncertainty into the U.S. clean energy sector, despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While renewables have grown significantly, Trump's support for fossil fuels and proposed tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia could raise costs for renewable energy projects. In the first quarter of the year, several clean energy projects were cancelled, highlighting the risks posed by an unstable policy environment. Experts believe the sector will continue to grow, but at a slower pace, and the U.S. will need to compete globally as countries move towards cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives. While a spokesman for Mr. Witkoff denied that the proposal had come up in the talks, some Iranian media outlets have published front-page accounts of Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúnew plan on the negotiating table.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>U.S. Egg Prices Fall Slightly But Remain Near Record Highs Due to Bird Flu</h2>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a slight decrease in April, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This marks the first month-to-month drop in egg prices since October 2024. However, despite the decline, prices remain near historic highs due to the persistent outbreak of bird flu, which has decimated egg-laying hen populations. President Trump has focused on lowering egg prices, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from other countries.</p>

          <p>Dr. Rosemary Coogan, a European Space Agency astronaut, is undergoing rigorous training at NASA's Johnson Space Center to prepare for a potential mission to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. Her training includes spacewalk simulations in a massive underwater pool and learning how to use the facilities on board the ISS. With NASA planning a return to the Moon through the Artemis program, Coogan may have the opportunity to become the first Briton to walk on the lunar surface, a prospect she finds incredibly exciting.</p>
