          <p>Boaz Barak, a computer science professor at Harvard University, argues against the increasing politicization of university classrooms. He recounts his personal experiences of balancing his professional duties with his activism, emphasizing the importance of maintaining boundaries between academic and political spheres. Barak believes that the erosion of trust in higher education is partly due to the blurring lines between scholarship and activism. He advocates for professionalism and the development of critical thinking skills, suggesting that universities should focus on fostering habits of mind rather than promoting specific ideologies.</p>

          <p>James Harden delivered a standout performance in Game 6, scoring 28 points to help the Los Angeles Clippers avoid elimination and extend their playoff series against the Denver Nuggets to a decisive Game 7. Harden's performance was a stark contrast to his previous struggles in the series, prompting coach Tyronn Lue to adjust the team's strategy to create more space for him. With the series tied, the Clippers now have an opportunity to advance further than any team in franchise history, contingent on Harden maintaining his level of play in the upcoming game. However, questions remain about his endurance, as he played 47 minutes in Game 6.</p>

          <p>Netflix stock has reached all-time high levels, trading positively for 11 consecutive days, marking the company's longest win streak ever. This surge follows a strong earnings report in April, with revenue growing 13% due to higher subscription and advertising revenue. Netflix has been a top-performing stock during the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, largely unaffected by tariffs and trade wars. While traditional media stocks have struggled, Netflix's co-CEO stated that they haven't seen any major impacts from the economic climate, as entertainment has historically been resilient during tougher times.

          <p>Temu, the online retailer known for ultra-discounted items shipped directly from China, has stopped shipping directly from China to the U.S. due to the end of the de minimis tariff loophole. The Trump administration's new rules on low-value shipments took effect on Friday, forcing Temu to change its business model. The company is now focusing on products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses and recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. The changes have led to increased prices and altered the selection of goods available to American shoppers.</p>

The article suggests that Fox News serves as both a media outlet and an in-house communications organ for the administration. The author concludes that as long as both parties benefit from the relationship, it will remain strong, regardless of any apparent tensions.</p>
