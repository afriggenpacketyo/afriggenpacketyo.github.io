          <p>During the US PGA Championship, both Shane Lowry and Tyrrell Hatton displayed their frustration with the course conditions, resulting in outbursts that could lead to fines. Lowry swore about the course after not receiving relief for an embedded ball, while Hatton swore at his driver after a poor tee shot. Hatton acknowledged his behavior, admitting he sometimes says the wrong thing when running hot in the moment, and noted that it was not his finest moment on the course. Both golfers' tempers flared amidst challenging conditions at Quail Hollow, highlighting the intense pressure of the championship. </p>

          <p>Former Wales rugby international Jamie Roberts is set to begin his medical career as a junior doctor in the NHS, twelve years after graduating from Cardiff University's school of medicine. Roberts, who won 94 caps for Wales and was a British and Irish Lion, balanced his rugby career with his medical studies, completing his undergraduate degree over seven years due to his sporting commitments. He later pursued postgraduate degrees while continuing to play rugby, and after retiring from the sport, Roberts passed a "return to medicine" exam. Roberts hopes to specialize in sports medicine or orthopedics, drawing from his own experiences with injuries sustained during his rugby career.</p>

          <p>According to analysts, China is employing a flexible strategy to engage with nations that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, as evidenced by the participation of delegations from Haiti and St Lucia at a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite these countries recognizing Taiwan, their attendance at the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum indicates a pragmatic approach to diplomacy. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries had informed them of their intention to attend, and that relations remained stable. This approach reflects a broader trend among countries towards more practical diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for its presidential election, which will determine whether Donald Tusk's pro-European government can advance its reform plans, currently blocked by the national-conservative president. The two front-runners are left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. Trzaskowski aims to restore the rule of law and liberalize social policies, while Nawrocki criticizes immigrants and EU policies. The election's outcome will significantly impact Poland's domestic and foreign policies, with a runoff likely between Trzaskowski and Nawrocki.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the area. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust and carrying it into the city. Visibility dropped to zero in some areas, causing drivers to pull over and flights to be temporarily grounded at Midway International Airport. The dust storm cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, leaving residents in awe of the unusual phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump received a series of accolades and economic pledges during his tour of the Middle East, a stark contrast to the challenges he faces at home. He was treated with honor and respect in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, securing investment pledges and receiving the UAE's highest civilian honor. The trip allowed Trump to announce over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and the visited nations. While his administration faces criticism over tariff policies and ethics at home, Trump's visit to the Arabian Peninsula was marked by enthusiastic support and economic gains.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment and aid in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its presence and wielding its wealth across the continent. The UAE's investments, primarily in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects, have exploded in recent years, dwarfing amounts pledged by other countries. This is part of a plan to increase the country‚Äôs influence, particularly over global supply chains. While the U.S. reduces its presence in Africa, the UAE is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, and it sees Africa as an essential part of the plan.</p>
