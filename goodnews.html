          <p>The Trump administration is privately fundraising for a new, multi-million dollar ballroom on the White House grounds, with corporations like Google and Lockheed Martin reportedly pledging significant donations. To incentivize contributions, officials have discussed offering donors permanent recognition, possibly by etching their names into the structure itself. The project, named "The Donald J. Trump Ballroom at the White House" in pledge forms, is being managed by a nonprofit, allowing for tax-deductible donations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week peak, even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market reaction reflects investor focus on broader economic indicators beyond the Fed's immediate policy, including signs of resilient GDP growth and slightly higher inflation. While the Fed's move was intended to manage economic risks, the bond market's behavior suggests that concerns about long-term growth and government debt are also influencing sentiment.

This update suggests that despite ongoing economic uncertainties, dialogue on key international issues is continuing, providing some stability to market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the lengthy 85-page filing "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and "vituperation" rather than focusing on legal claims. However, the dismissal is not final, as the judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professionally structured complaint that adheres to procedural rules.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has led to a decrease in mortgage rates, providing financial relief for homebuyers and homeowners. For a $750,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment is now approximately $450 lower than it was at the start of the year, translating to over $5,000 in annual savings. This shift enhances affordability for new buyers and creates compelling refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners, with the potential for further rate cuts later this year.

He believes that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will likely be a temporary, "one-time effect," which provides the central bank with room to ease monetary policy further. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and his assessment that long-term inflation expectations remain under control. (not investment advice)</p>
