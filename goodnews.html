          <p>OpenAI announced that its nonprofit arm will retain control of the company, even as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, following pressure from civic leaders and former employees. This decision comes after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware, and will change the equity structure, allowing employees, investors, and the nonprofit to own equity in the PBC. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the arrangement, emphasizing the shared mission between the nonprofit and PBC. The company is currently engaged in a legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes OpenAI's transition to a for-profit entity.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that gasoline prices have fallen to $1.98 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates due to perceived lack of inflation. However, the national average gas price is actually around $3.165 per gallon, according to AAA. The $1.98 figure likely refers to RBOB gasoline futures, which track wholesale, unfinished gasoline prices before taxes and other costs are added. Experts emphasize that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers as they do not reflect the final price paid at the pump.</p>

Her mother's family escaped 10 days before the fall of Saigon on a C-130 cargo plane, spending three months at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas before settling in Owego, New York. Her father, a South Vietnamese Navy soldier, sailed to Subic Bay and then to Guam before finding a sponsor in Connecticut, enduring four years of uncertainty before contacting his family.

          <p>New York City has ended its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which had been in place since 1997 to protect its drinking water supply. The city had purchased over 1,800 properties, totaling 156,350 acres, to prevent pollution and avoid building a filtration plant. The decision to halt the program came after an independent review concluded that further land purchases would be of little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring local approval for any land transactions.</p>

          <p>France's former interior minister, G√©rald Darmanin, has apologized to Liverpool fans for the 2022 fiasco at the Stade de France, admitting that security arrangements were wrong and his initial remarks blaming English fans were a mistake. Darmanin acknowledged that the real problem stemmed from delinquents robbing fans, not from English supporters, and that the police were ill-equipped to handle the situation. He said the night was "the biggest failure" of his career, and he apologized to Liverpool supporters for the hurt caused by the false accusations.</p>
