          <h2>Nvidia Shares Fluctuate Amid Reports of Potential Policy Shift on Chip Exports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 16:07:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced volatility following reports that the Trump administration may revise chip trade restrictions, specifically the "AI diffusion" rule which limits exports of advanced AI chips to certain countries. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed these restrictions, with AMD's CEO Lisa Su advocating for a balance between national security and industry growth. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang previously expressed concerns that being excluded from the Chinese AI market would be detrimental to the company's growth. The potential policy change comes as the chip industry grapples with balancing national security concerns and maintaining access to key international markets.</p>

          <p>Senators Angela Alsobrooks and Katie Britt have introduced the Homeless Children & Youth Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at expanding federal support for homeless youth and young-adult families. The bill seeks to standardize the definition of homelessness across federal agencies to provide fuller resources to affected individuals. Proponents emphasize that youth are often overlooked in discussions about homelessness and that the bill will improve visibility and understanding of the issue. The legislation has garnered endorsements from at least 15 homelessness advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>The long-postponed deadline for Real ID enforcement at US airports has arrived, with many travelers showing up early with compliant identification or passports. Despite initial concerns about potential delays, minimal wait times were reported at LaGuardia and other airports. While the TSA stated that full enforcement would begin, the Department of Homeland Security indicated that travelers without Real ID-compliant documents would still be allowed to fly after additional screening. Some travelers expressed confusion and reservations about the Real ID requirement, while others took extra measures to ensure compliance.</p>

The park will combine Disney's iconic stories and attractions with Abu Dhabi's culture and architecture. This will be Disney's seventh theme park resort. The decision to build in Abu Dhabi has drawn criticism due to the UAE's human rights record. Disney has also faced criticism for its response to anti-LGBTQ+ policies in Florida.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses whether it makes sense to renew a maturing certificate of deposit (CD) account in 2025, given the likelihood of interest rate cuts. It suggests that savers should still consider renewing their CD accounts, as the rate cut trajectory could change, and the rate cuts are likely to be small. Additionally, savers would lose the interest-earning opportunity in the interim if they moved their funds elsewhere. The article advises readers to weigh their economic needs and the opportunity to earn elevated interest before making a decision.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders and eight Democratic colleagues have urged Paramount Global not to settle with Donald Trump over a $20 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes. The senators argue that settling would capitulate to Trump's attempts to intimidate the media and suppress free speech. They characterize Trump's lawsuit, which alleges election interference due to the network's editing of an interview with Kamala Harris, as a meritless attack on the First Amendment. The senators praise Paramount Global's initial decision to file motions to dismiss the case.</p>

With questions about what the Trump administration's tariffs will mean for the U.S. economy, the Fed wants to "wait and see and watch," Powell said.
