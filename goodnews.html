          <p>Starbucks has announced that its corporate employees must return to the office four days a week starting in October. As part of this policy shift, the company is offering a voluntary exit program with a cash payout for those who do not wish to comply. CEO Brian Niccol stated the decision is crucial for the company's turnaround strategy, which focuses on improving efficiency and the customer experience amid slumping sales. This move follows previous efforts to increase in-office presence and streamline operations, including job cuts earlier in the year.</p>

          <h2>Examining the 'Age 75 Rule' for Purchasing Annuities in Retirement Planning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:20:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the informal "age 75 rule" for annuities, a common belief that retirees should wait until that age to purchase one to secure higher payouts. It explains that while payouts do increase with age due to shorter life expectancy calculations, waiting is not always the best strategy. Delaying an annuity purchase can expose savings to market risk and deplete assets needed for earlier retirement years. The piece advises that the optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including financial goals, health, and other income sources, rather than a universal age benchmark.

          <h2>Archaeologists in Guam Discover 3,500-Year-Old Rice, Earliest Evidence in Remote Oceania</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:03:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania, dating back 3,500 years, at a site in Guam. The discovery was made in the form of phytoliths, which are fossilized plant parts, found exclusively on ancient earthenware pottery within a cave. Researchers believe the rice was not used for daily consumption but played a role in specialized rituals performed at the site, which also contained rare rock art and formal burials. This finding suggests the first settlers of Guam successfully transported and cultivated rice after a remarkable 2,300-kilometer open-ocean journey.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched a preview of Kiro, an artificial intelligence program designed to assist developers in writing software code. The tool aims to transform development by helping users define requirements and system design before generating code, a process known as "vibe coding." Kiro can create diagrams and task lists to streamline the development process and currently uses models from the Amazon-backed AI firm Anthropic. This move places Amazon in direct competition with similar AI coding tools from Microsoft and Google, signaling a major push into automated software development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the new academic year approaches, this article provides guidance on choosing between federal and private student loans. It recommends that students first exhaust all federal loan options due to their fixed interest rates, income-driven repayment plans, and potential for forgiveness. However, federal loans have borrowing limits that may not cover the full cost of attendance. Private loans can fill this funding gap but often have variable rates, fewer borrower protections, and require a strong credit history or a co-signer. The best strategy involves using federal loans as a foundation and cautiously using private loans to cover remaining costs. (not investment advice)</p>

In a historic moment for Irish cycling, Ben Healy finished third on the stage, which was enough to propel him into the overall lead. Healy becomes the first Irish rider to wear the coveted yellow jersey in 38 years, since Stephen Roche's victory in 1987.</p>
