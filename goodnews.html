          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at AMD's decision to offer OpenAI 10% of its company as part of their recent partnership. Huang acknowledged the deal as "clever," especially considering AMD's enthusiasm for its next-generation products. The agreement involves OpenAI purchasing 6 gigawatts of chips from AMD over several years, potentially granting OpenAI a 10% ownership stake in AMD if warrants are fully exercised. Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in xAI's funding round and praised Nvidia's investment in AI data center operator CoreWeave, highlighting Nvidia's commitment to building out the AI infrastructure for the world. The CEO expressed excitement about opportunities to collaborate with Elon Musk. Optimism centers on the continued growth and investment in the AI sector. </p>

          <p>Joan B. Kennedy, the former wife of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has died at the age of 89, having lived a life marked by both personal tragedy and public scrutiny. Joan, a model and classically-trained pianist, married Ted Kennedy in 1958 and faced numerous challenges, including family assassinations, her husband's scandals, and her own struggles with alcoholism and mental health. She stood by her husband during the Chappaquiddick scandal but eventually divorced him, later becoming an advocate for the arts and mental health awareness. She is remembered by her family for her courage, talent, and dedication to helping others. </p>

Police found signs of a struggle in the cellar of Stalzer's home, along with the discarded clothes she was wearing and two knives believed to be the weapons. Prosecutors stated that the daughter is not currently being detained, and both she and her brother will be transferred to youth services.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt reaching record levels, this article outlines practical strategies for individuals struggling with balances over $10,000. Options include working with credit counseling agencies to negotiate lower interest rates and create debt management plans. Debt consolidation loans can replace high-interest credit cards with a single, fixed-rate loan, potentially saving thousands in interest. Zero-percent balance transfer cards offer a promotional period without interest, allowing borrowers to pay down principal faster, and debt settlement can reduce the amount owed through negotiation with creditors.

          <p>Former England captain Steven Gerrard attributes the failure of England's 'Golden Generation' to a lack of team cohesion and excessive egos. Club rivalries and a rigid tactical approach under various managers also contributed to their inability to achieve major tournament success. While individual talent was abundant, other nations possessed equally strong squads and better tactical strategies. Ultimately, a combination of factors, including club rivalries, injuries, and psychological pressure, hindered their performance on the international stage. </p>
