          <p>Under previous chairman, Bola Tinubu, the West African economic bloc faced the greatest challenges of its 50-year history. Its new leader faces an uphill battle to prevent further fragmentation. The new chairman, Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio, clearly has his work cut out for him and knows it, too, as the unity of the bloc and indeed much of the entire region is facing unprecedented threats to its integrity. The bloc's coffers, meanwhile, just received a fresh cash injection from the European Union last week of ‚Ç¨110 million.</p>

          <p>Giulia Gwinn has big boots to fill, having taken over from retired captain Alexandra Popp just a few months ago. Gwinn started playing football at the age of eight ‚Äì as the only girl on a boys' team at TSG Ailingen, her hometown club in the southwest of Germany. After four years at Freiburg, Gwinn moved to Bayern Munich in 2019. Looking ahead to next month's Euros, Gwinn is positive about Germany's potential on the pitch but sees her team's role as much bigger than that.</p>

          <p>Two bears who sparked the evacuation of a wildlife park involving trained firearms staff and police had headed straight for the honey store, the park has said. Wildwood Devon, a conservation charity near Exeter, said European brown bears Mish and Lucy made their way to the food store after breaking free - and then consumed a "week's worth of honey". The park was evacuated after the alarm was raised at about 15:00 BST on Monday - 16 people including children were locked into a play barn for their safety.</p>
