          <p>A recent Reddit thread sparked a debate about the permissibility of vaping in airplane bathrooms. Users claiming to be flight attendants noted that sensors throughout the plane can detect aerosols from e-cigarettes, triggering alarms in the cockpit. Travel expert Gary Leff confirmed that modern smoke detectors are capable of detecting vaping aerosols. While vaping is prohibited on planes, some passengers admit to vaping discreetly, highlighting inconsistencies in enforcement. The article suggests nicotine gum as an alternative for those heavily reliant on nicotine. </p>

          <p>CNBC's The China Connection newsletter discusses the altered landscape of U.S.-China relations following recent trade talks and tariff adjustments. While a temporary tariff reduction provides some relief, businesses recognize the need to mitigate tariff uncertainty and diversify supply chains. China is emphasizing self-sufficiency, particularly in critical minerals, and seeking to expand trade relationships with Southeast Asia and Latin America. Despite ongoing tensions, some analysts believe that the U.S. and China will continue to engage in trade, but businesses should prepare for long-term volatility. </p>

          <p>Taiwanese authorities have moved to reassure the public following U.S. President Donald Trump's use of the word 'unification' in the context of U.S.-China trade talks. Trump's comment, made after a round of trade talks, sparked concern in Taiwan. Taiwan's presidential office emphasized that the U.S. State Department clarified that Trump's remarks were unrelated to Taiwan and reaffirmed Washington's commitment to the island. The office also stated that Taiwan-related issues were not discussed during the trade talks and that the administration will continue to prioritize national interests and economic stability. </p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court ruled that the European Commission should not have denied a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer's CEO during negotiations for COVID-19 vaccines. The court stated that the commission failed to provide credible explanations for not releasing the messages or explaining why they were deemed to lack important information. The case, brought by The New York Times, raises questions about public access to information regarding negotiations that involve taxpayer money and shape public policy. The ruling could set a legal precedent for what constitutes an official document in the EU. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the removal of all U.S. sanctions on Syria, citing the opportunity for the country to achieve greatness under its new transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. The decision aims to facilitate the restoration of normal relations between the U.S. and Syria for the first time in over a decade. The sanctions, which had been in place since 1979 and intensified in 2004 and 2011, were seen as hindering humanitarian aid and economic progress. The United Nations and other organizations had advocated for sanctions relief following the devastating 2023 earthquake. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's policies, including halting permits for wind energy projects and proposing tariffs, are creating uncertainty for the renewable energy sector in the U.S. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), hostility towards clean technology is causing investors to reconsider building facilities in the U.S. Tariffs on Southeast Asia, a major supplier of components, could significantly impact solar energy development. While renewables account for over 20% of electricity generation in the U.S., Trump's support for fossil fuels and threats to repeal parts of the IRA could slow the sector's growth. </p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced tariffs on each other's imports and suspended reciprocal duties for 90 days following high-level trade talks. The U.S. cut tariffs to 30% from 145%, while China reduced retaliatory tariffs to 10% from 125%. However, both countries are retaining a portion of the tariff hike and a separate levy on Chinese efforts to curb fentanyl flow. During talks, China agreed to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. </p>

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and injuries, building on previous discoveries of self-medication behaviors. Chimpanzees were filmed dabbing plants on wounds and chewing plants to apply to injuries, both on themselves and others. The research adds to the growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild. Observations include chimpanzees tending to the wounds of unrelated animals, suggesting empathy. </p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canadians were not impressed by the UK government's decision to offer Donald Trump a second state visit. The invitation cut across clear messages Canada was sending to the White House regarding its sovereignty. Carney invited King Charles to open Canadian parliament, signaling sovereignty. Tensions between Canada and the US have abated since a meeting where Trump shifted from an expectation to a desire to annex Canada. </p>
