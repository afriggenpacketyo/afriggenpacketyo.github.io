          <p>A retired grandfather from Illinois experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and rapid weight loss, which doctors initially struggled to diagnose. After months of tests, a stomach scan revealed he had chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition where narrowed arteries restrict blood flow to the small intestine. The psychological toll of being unable to eat was significant, but his condition was successfully treated with a minimally invasive stent procedure. Following a follow-up surgery for a common complication, he has fully recovered, regained his weight, and emphasizes the importance for patients to advocate for their own health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two German states, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, have significantly updated their burial legislation to reflect modern societal wishes. Effective October 1, the new laws in Rhineland-Palatinate will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes. These changes address a cultural shift where cremation is now preferred by three-quarters of the population. While the move is supported by funeral directors as aligning with public demand for personalized mourning, it has drawn criticism from Christian churches concerned about the dignity of remains.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest car buyers follow the "20-4-10" rule to ensure their vehicle purchase remains affordable and to avoid owing more than the car is worth. This guideline recommends a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years, and keeping total monthly transportation costs—including loan payment, insurance, fuel, and maintenance—at or below 10% of your monthly income. While high car prices can make adhering to this rule challenging, financial planners emphasize its importance for preventing vehicle costs from interfering with long-term savings and investment goals.

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open water for the next several days. The current forecast track shows Gabrielle moving north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island, while no other land areas are currently under threat.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, shares insights from his "Green Idea House," a remodeled home that has produced more energy than it consumes for over a decade. The project involved eliminating natural gas, installing 26 solar panels, and utilizing smart design features like roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling. By using standard materials and off-the-shelf technologies, the owner says the remodel cost less than traditional construction and saves his family nearly $5,000 annually in utility bills. Key lessons include meticulous planning, persistence with contractors, and adapting to a changing climate, demonstrating that sustainable living can be both achievable and economical.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like hairy caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are a cherished part of the national diet, valued for being a nutritious and organic source of protein. In the markets of Kinshasa, these insects are sold fresh or fried as a snack, with caterpillars considered a delicacy and maggots a more common staple. The practice, rooted in tradition, has reportedly grown in recent decades due to economic hardship and the scarcity of other protein sources. Non-profit organizations are now farming the larvae to provide food for orphanages and meet growing commercial demand, highlighting their importance in the local food system.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to filming in California, keeping all of his current and upcoming projects in the Los Angeles area despite industry trends of relocating for cheaper costs. After recent wildfires devastated local communities, Kelley's production company decided against moving, a choice solidified by recent enhancements to the state's film and TV tax credit program. Projects like "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer" will continue to shoot locally, a move Kelley feels is a way to reinvest in the community that has been central to his successful career.</p>
