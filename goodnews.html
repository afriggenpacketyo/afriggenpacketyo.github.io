          <p>Spotify is launching managed accounts in several countries, including the U.S. and U.K., to give parents more control over their children's listening experience. Designed for kids under 13, these accounts operate within the main Spotify app but allow parents to filter explicit content, block specific songs or artists, and hide video content. This new feature, part of the Premium Family plan, aims to provide a safer environment for young users while allowing them to have personalized playlists and recommendations separate from their parents' accounts.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average retiree's monthly benefit by approximately $56 starting in January. This adjustment, which affects about 75 million Americans receiving Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, is calculated based on inflation data to help benefits keep pace with rising prices. However, the net increase for beneficiaries will also be affected by rising Medicare Part B premiums, which are typically deducted directly from their checks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While recent drops in mortgage rates have captured headlines, rates have generally been declining for most of 2025, falling from around 7% at the start of the year. It's a misconception that mortgage rates move in perfect lockstep with Federal Reserve rate cuts; multiple factors, including the 10-year Treasury yield and individual borrower credit profiles, play a significant role. Lenders often "price in" anticipated Fed cuts in advance, meaning rate changes are not always a direct, immediate reaction to the central bank's decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With average credit card APRs at their highest levels in decades, consumers have several options to potentially lower their rates. One direct approach is to contact the card issuer and request a rate reduction, especially for customers with a good payment history. Other effective strategies include transferring balances to a card with a 0% introductory APR or consolidating multiple high-interest debts into a single personal loan with a lower, fixed rate. For those facing significant financial hardship, enrolling in a debt management program can also provide relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Bavaria have seized a large collection of forged artworks, purported to be by famous artists like Picasso and Rembrandt, in a coordinated operation across Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. The main suspect, a 77-year-old man, and ten alleged accomplices are accused of attempting to sell the counterfeit pieces for millions of euros. The investigation began after the ringleader tried to sell a forged version of Rembrandt's "De Staalmeesters," the original of which hangs in Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, for over 120 million Swiss francs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose at a 3.0% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than economists' expectations, according to a long-delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The release, postponed by the government shutdown, showed a monthly increase of 0.3%, driven largely by a significant jump in gasoline prices. With core inflation also showing moderation, the data reinforces market expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support a slowing labor market.

          <p>A cold snap is expected across the United Kingdom this weekend, with temperatures dropping below average and potentially bringing the first snowfall of the season to some areas. The change in weather, driven by a cold Arctic airflow from Storm Benjamin in the North Sea, will coincide with the end of British Summer Time as the clocks go back. Strong, gusty northerly winds will make conditions feel particularly raw, especially along eastern coasts, signaling a distinct shift toward more wintry weather.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has secured a historic victory in the Caerphilly by-election, ending 100 years of Labour Party control in the constituency. Plaid's candidate, Lindsay Whittle, won with 47% of the vote, marking a significant 27% swing away from Labour. The result is a major blow to Labour in a traditional stronghold and a significant boost for Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth ahead of next year's Senedd election, suggesting the party's pro-Wales message is gaining traction.</p>

          <p>A new study of fossils in New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America just before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. By accurately dating the rock formations, researchers determined the fossils, including those of a Tyrannosaurus rex and the massive Alamosaurus, were from about 400,000 years before the asteroid strike. This evidence challenges the long-debated theory that dinosaurs were already in decline, indicating instead that their reign was brought to an abrupt and sudden end.</p>
