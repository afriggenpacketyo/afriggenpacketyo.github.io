          <p>New York Mets pitcher Jonah Tong has shared a unique culinary preference that has captured the attention of baseball fans. The Canadian player revealed in an interview that his secret to a perfect grilled cheese sandwich is dipping it in maple syrup. He credits his grandfather with introducing him to this "unbelievable" food combination, which he says is his favorite thing to eat. Tong, who was selected in the 2022 MLB Draft, recently made his major league debut for the Mets, bringing his distinctive taste from his personal life onto the public stage.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has officially begun her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, a move interpreted as a reaction to her staunch criticism of the war in Ukraine. Despite some political friction in Germany over her nomination, Baerbock will now chair and manage UN meetings, aiming to act as a "unifier" and "honest broker" for all 193 member states. Her new role comes as her party transitions to an opposition role in German domestic politics.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the profound personal and familial challenges that accompanied her 2020 nomination to the high court. She describes the decision-making process with her husband, which involved a commitment to "burn the boats," meaning there would be no second-guessing their move to Washington D.C. and the public scrutiny that would follow. Barrett recounts the intense media attention and loss of privacy, including an incident where she had to scale a fence in high heels to evade reporters. The passage provides a personal glimpse into the sacrifices required for public service at the highest level.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a 26.4-mile open-ocean route from Catalina Island to San Pedro, California, in a kayak he grew entirely from mycelium, the root network of mushrooms. The 12-hour journey marks a significant achievement in exploring sustainable alternatives to plastics used in aquatic recreation. The material, known as AquaFung, is lightweight, buoyant, and biodegradable, offering an environmentally friendly option. Shoemaker's project, supported by the arts organization Fulcrum Arts, aims to inspire further innovation in fungal materials and demonstrates the potential of biomaterials in practical applications beyond the art gallery.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Panic Over New Tariff Rule May Be Overstated for Most Small Businesses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 10:00:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has raised concerns about its impact on small businesses. However, this article argues that the panic may be misdirected, as the majority of the nation's 33 million small businesses are service-based and do not directly purchase international goods. While acknowledging that the change will cause price increases and affect some businesses, the author contends that the broader economy can likely absorb these costs as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong. The focus, it suggests, should be on the overall health of the labor market and consumer spending power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in the game's history, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. The winning numbers were drawn on Saturday, ending a three-month period without a grand prize winner. The Texas ticket was sold at a convenience store in Fredericksburg. Each winner will have the choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump sum cash payment, which for this jackpot was estimated at $826.4 million before taxes. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are approximately 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles have been eliminated from the Women's Rugby World Cup despite a dominant 60-0 victory over Samoa. Australia's subsequent performance against England secured them the final quarter-final spot based on points differential. While the team will be disappointed to miss the knockout stage, their performance showcased a promising new generation of players. Stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in the tournament, and lock Erica Jarrell-Searcy signal a bright future for the program. The team's spirit and the emergence of this young talent are seen as key positives as they look ahead to the next World Cup cycle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical things parents can do to support their child's long-term health and success. These habits are crucial for a baby's physical, mental, and cognitive development and are linked to a child's ability to learn, concentrate, and regulate emotions later in life. Dr. Golshevsky suggests techniques such as recreating a womb-like environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped. He advises creating a flexible routine, emphasizing that parents should learn to interpret their baby's unique cues.</p>

          <h2>Column Argues Solar Power is the Ideal Energy Solution for Self-Reliant Conservatives and Preppers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 09:00:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column makes the case that solar energy, often associated with left-leaning environmentalism, should be embraced by right-wing individualists and preppers concerned with self-sufficiency. The author contrasts the complexity and dependency of fossil fuels—requiring vast infrastructure for drilling, refining, and distribution—with the simplicity and independence of solar panels. Solar systems are durable, require minimal maintenance, and provide energy directly from the sun, making them a resilient power source in case of societal breakdown. The article suggests that beyond its climate benefits, solar power aligns perfectly with a conservative ethos of self-reliance, offering true energy independence for a homeowner.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as the head coach of the University of North Carolina football team with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he addressed and confirmed reports of growing animosity with his former employer, the New England Patriots. Belichick stated that since he is not welcome in the Patriots' facility, their scouts are not welcome at UNC's practices, confirming a ban. The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss to TCU. Belichick noted an improved level of determination from his team leading up to their first successful outing.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Increased Coal Power Serves as a 'Shock Absorber' for Renewables Grid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's simultaneous expansion of both renewable energy and coal power is not a contradiction in its climate policy. While China is adding record amounts of solar capacity, issues like grid curtailment (where generated clean power cannot be used) and weather-dependent output from sources like hydropower create instability. In this context, new coal plants are being built not as a primary energy source, but as a crucial backup system. They act as a "shock absorber," ensuring grid stability during peak demand and allowing for the aggressive integration of vast new renewable projects without risking blackouts.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the second-hand clothing marketplace Vinted, shares the story of how the company began in 2008 from her own personal problem: having too many clothes to fit into a new, smaller apartment. What started as a simple website created with a friend, Justas Janauskas, to sell her unwanted items quickly grew by word-of-mouth. The platform expanded internationally, overcame a disastrous business decision to add commission fees, and eventually, under new leadership, grew into Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup valued at over a billion dollars. The article highlights the journey from a simple solution for clutter to a major player in the sustainable fashion industry.</p>
