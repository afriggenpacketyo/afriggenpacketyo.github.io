          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second in its history for the region. High winds, reaching 60 to 70 mph, lifted dust from dry farmlands, creating a thick haze that significantly reduced visibility, especially on major interstates. The storm caused ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports and led to reports of "mud rain" in some areas where showers coincided with the dust. While the dust storm has subsided, cooler and drier weather is expected for the weekend, with a rainy pattern returning next week.</p>

The company sorts the shoes for reuse or recycling, with reusable shoes being shipped to developing countries for resale in local shops. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and transformed into materials like foam, rubber, and textiles for use in flooring, mats, and even sandals. The company processes over one million shoes annually, aiming to reduce waste and create economic opportunities in developing nations.

          <p>Hong Kong is preparing for a potential influx of mainland Chinese companies that may face delisting from US stock exchanges. As tensions between the US and China rise, the possibility of Chinese companies being removed from American exchanges has increased.

This move is seen as an opportunity for Hong Kong to bolster its financial markets and attract more mainland firms.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense scientists are developing a new rocket artillery system capable of striking aerial targets. The Tianxing-1, or "Sky Star-1," is a guided munition with lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins, allowing for extended range and maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets autonomously. While operating on similar principles to hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 travels at a slower pace, potentially limiting its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
