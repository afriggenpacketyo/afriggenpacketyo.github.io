        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a major trade agreement, which President Trump described as "massive." The deal establishes a new 15% tariff on Japanese exports, notably lowering the duty on automobiles from the current 25% rate. In a significant move, Japan has also committed to investing $550 billion into the U.S. and will open its domestic markets to a wider range of American goods, including vehicles and key agricultural products. This agreement, reached after a period of intense negotiations, is expected to create hundreds of thousands of American jobs and has already caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams secured a landmark victory at the DC Open, becoming the second-oldest woman in the professional era to win a tour-level singles match. At 45 years old, Williams defeated Peyton Stearns, an opponent 22 years her junior, in straight sets, marking her first singles win in nearly two years. The victory represents a significant comeback for the former world number one, who had been listed as inactive after undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids. Williams' performance, highlighted by her signature powerful serves and groundstrokes, was met with overwhelmingly enthusiastic support from the crowd in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automaker Stocks Surge Following US Tariff Reduction Announcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 21:58:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following the announcement of a reduced U.S. tariff rate on their products. The new 15% tariff on automobiles, down from 25%, provided immediate relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry, which had seen exports to the U.S. decline sharply in recent months. Toyota's stock jumped nearly 12%, while others like Mazda saw gains of over 17%, reflecting market optimism and relief from previous uncertainty. Analysts noted that while the news is a welcome short-term boost, the industry still faces long-term competitive challenges from other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key factor in England's dramatic run to the Euro 2025 final has been the impact of substitutes Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang, drawing comparisons to the famous "super subs" of the 2022 tournament. Both players were instrumental in turning around crucial matches, including the quarter-final against Sweden where they helped erase a 2-0 deficit. In the semi-final against Italy, 19-year-old Agyemang scored a 96th-minute equalizer to force extra time, before Kelly scored the winning goal in the 119th minute. Their clutch performances off the bench have been vital to the team's success and have made them fan favorites.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, setting a 19% tariff rate for goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. The deal with the Philippines, concluded after a White House meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., will reportedly see the country become an "open market" with zero tariffs on U.S. goods. Similarly, the agreement with Indonesia involves the elimination of 99% of its tariff barriers on American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. These deals are part of the administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships ahead of an August 1 deadline for new tariff implementations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The remains of a 250-year-old wooden ship discovered on a beach in the Orkney Islands of Scotland have been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied history. Originally a Royal Navy warship named HMS Hind, it participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as an Arctic whaling ship. Researchers used a combination of dendrochronology, archival records, and community-led efforts to identify the wreck, which was unearthed by a storm in early 2024. The discovery has energized the local community, and plans are being discussed to preserve and display the ship's timbers.</p>
