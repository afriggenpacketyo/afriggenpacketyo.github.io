          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders began rookie minicamp, with Gabriel receiving the first snaps, but head coach Kevin Stefanski cautioned against reading too much into the order. Stefanski emphasized that the team has a plan for evaluating all five quarterbacks on the roster and that the evaluation process is comprehensive, extending beyond practice reps. The Browns' quarterback situation is uncertain due to Deshaun Watson's Achilles injury, leaving the Week 1 starter position open among Watson, Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, Gabriel, and Sanders.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying for President Trump's tax agenda, with key issues emerging as policy experts weigh in on potential impacts. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, but significant changes are anticipated before the final vote. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation, requiring adherence to a limited budget framework. Experts note that the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for a more fiscally responsible package could pose challenges to the bill's passage and specific provisions.</p>

Gates' wealth, stemming from co-founding Microsoft, will be used to double the foundation's giving to $200 billion by 2045, after which it will be dissolved, with the intent to address global challenges more effectively.
