          <p>President Donald Trump is defending a plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating it would be a "very nice gesture" considering U.S. assistance to the country. The potential value of the plane and its handling have raised legal and ethical questions due to the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics, including some of Trump's supporters, have raised concerns about the ethics of accepting such a gift, while the White House insists any gift will be accepted in compliance with applicable laws. The Qatari government says the transfer is for "temporary use" and is under discussion.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, citing that there are no more excuses for inaction and releasing a model ordinance for local municipalities. Newsom emphasized the need to take back the streets and provide alternatives to encampments, backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding. The model ordinance states that policies towards encampments must reflect certain basic principles, including that no person should face criminal prosecution for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. This effort comes as Newsom approaches the end of his final term and speculation builds about his political future.</p>

          <p>An auction of the art collection of the Riggio family, who built their fortune on the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain, revealed a cautious mood in the art market. The auction, held at Christie's in New York, saw quiet bidding and presold items, indicating a lack of enthusiastic buyers compared to the market's peak in 2022. Experts attributed the sale's anticlimactic nature to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump‚Äôs tariffs and their potential impact on the global art market. Despite a $272 million total, the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations, signaling a need for auction houses to work harder in a healthy, but less exuberant market.</p>

          <p>Australia's Liberal Party has elected Sussan Ley as its first female leader, following a historic election loss. Ley, from the moderate faction, defeated Angus Taylor, who promised to restore conservative values. The Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, attributed to polarizing leaders and policies that alienated women and young people. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians and address the feeling of neglect among women and younger voters. The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected David Littleproud as leader.</p>

GLP-1 drugs, while effective for weight loss, are expensive and have side effects, making them suitable for a subset of Americans with excess visceral fat and related health issues. Physicians need to identify individuals who can benefit most from these drugs, using measures like waist size and blood-lipid patterns, rather than relying solely on BMI. Understanding the true killer‚Äînot weight, but toxic fat‚Äîis crucial for saving lives and improving health.</p>

          <h2>Federal Railroad Administration Considers Elon Musk's Boring Company for Amtrak Project</h2>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has engaged Elon Musk's tunneling firm, the Boring Company, to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, a multibillion-dollar Amtrak project. The FRA is seeking ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently, as Amtrak's estimated costs have increased from $6 billion to $8.5 billion. The discussions have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's other ventures and his role as an advisor to President Trump. The Department of Transportation confirmed it is consulting with several firms for the engineering contract.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal church‚Äôs migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing the church‚Äôs longstanding ‚Äúcommitment to racial justice and reconciliation‚Äù. Donald Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination, even as his administration abruptly shut down the overall US refugee program. The move marks the end of a ministry-government partnership that, for nearly four decades, has served nearly 110,000 refugees from countries, including Ukraine, Myanmar and Congo.</p>
