        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a notable environmental transformation, reducing pollution while simultaneously expanding its industrial base. Research indicates that from 2015 to 2022, the country achieved a 35.6% reduction in PM2.5 air pollution, a feat comparable to what the United States accomplished over three decades. This progress is not driven by deindustrialization but by a concerted effort in "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." The strategy relies heavily on deploying advanced green technology, implementing real-time environmental monitoring, and making massive investments in sustainable infrastructure to improve air and water quality.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nebius Group, a provider of Nvidia graphics chips for AI, soared after announcing a significant agreement with Microsoft valued at up to $19.4 billion over five years. Under the deal, Nebius will supply critical computing resources for AI workloads from a data center in New Jersey. This partnership highlights a growing trend of major tech companies like Microsoft turning to third-party suppliers to meet the intense demand for AI cloud infrastructure. The deal has substantially boosted Nebius's market valuation, which had already more than doubled this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of media mogul Rupert Murdoch has finalized a succession deal that solidifies control of his empire after his death. The agreement establishes a trust that places his chosen heir, Lachlan Murdoch, in charge of Fox Corp., ensuring continuity for conservative outlets like Fox News. As part of the arrangement, Lachlan's three older siblings will relinquish their claims to control in exchange for stock valued at approximately $3.3 billion. This resolution brings an end to years of public and private speculation over the future leadership of the influential media conglomerate.</p>

Now sober for eight years, he also discusses his HIV diagnosis and the relief he felt after making it public in 2015.

          <h2>Coyotes Observed Swimming Across San Francisco Bay to Angel Island</h2>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently captured fascinating footage of a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, the deep waterway separating the island from mainland Marin County. This observation provides a direct glimpse into how the island's "budding population" of coyotes likely arrived. The first breeding pair was documented on the island in 2017, and researchers have since found a small, related population has established itself. The event highlights the impressive swimming ability of coyotes and their capacity to colonize new territories, even across significant water barriers.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's designation of Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition. The homeowners had challenged the landmark status, arguing they had the right to raze the property they purchased in 2023. This ruling is a major victory for Monroe fans and preservationists who have fought to protect the only home the iconic actress ever owned independently. The decision concludes a years-long saga over the fate of the 1920s Spanish Colonial-style house where Monroe died in 1962.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, many savers are questioning the continued benefits of opening a high-yield savings account. While the peak interest rates of over 5% from recent years are gone, these accounts still offer returns exponentially higher than traditional savings accounts. The article argues that because rate cuts are likely to be gradual, these accounts remain a worthwhile option. They provide a strong return on savings while maintaining the crucial flexibility and access to funds that other high-rate instruments like CDs do not. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines with narrower eligibility criteria, primarily targeting adults aged 65 and older and younger people with certain high-risk medical conditions. While federal officials state that anyone who wants a vaccine can still get one after consulting with a doctor, the formal approval is more limited than in previous years. This change could restrict access for some healthier, younger individuals and may create confusion for patients and providers. The updated shots from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax are expected to be available in pharmacies soon.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Securing a Lower Mortgage Rate as 30-Year Fixed Average Declines</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers still have methods to secure even better terms. Experts advise that improving one's credit score is the most effective way to qualify for a lower rate, as lenders offer the best terms to the most creditworthy borrowers. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can significantly reduce the interest rate and eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider adjustable-rate mortgages, which often feature lower initial rates than traditional fixed-rate loans. (not investment advice)</p>
