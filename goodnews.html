          <p>The Japanese government will release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat soaring prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move aims to alleviate shortages and lower costs for consumers, with the released rice consisting of harvests from 2020 and 2021. The government hopes to make the rice available in stores at a reduced price of 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms, targeting smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops. This action follows previous releases and direct contracts with retailers, marking a rare step to address distribution shortages and public frustration over doubled rice prices, with suspicions of hoarding among wholesalers and farmers.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent during its bankruptcy proceedings. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield emphasized that biological samples, DNA data, health traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without informed consent. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seeks court approval to buy the struggling firm for $256 million, promising to adhere to 23andMe's privacy policies. An independent consumer privacy ombudsman was appointed to assess the proposed sale's impact on consumer privacy, highlighting concerns over the protection of deeply personal information.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are dominated by Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments and the government's ¬£14bn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear plant. The Sun criticizes Reeves's initial decision, while the Daily Express hails the U-turn as a victory for pensioners. The Guardian and the Telegraph highlight the government's decision to invest ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, which aims to provide six million homes with electricity. Additionally, the Times reports on a stand-off between Reeves and the Home Secretary over police funding, potentially impacting law and order targets.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the need for clean energy. The government aims to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, with nuclear power playing a crucial role. However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C argue that the money could be better spent on other priorities and fear the project will increase consumer bills.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC shows a drop from over 31,000 deaths in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, challenges remain for those with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction services by the Trump administration pose a risk to sustaining this progress.</p>
