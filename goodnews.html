          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The nanowire implants convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, stimulating the brain. This breakthrough offers significant potential for treating human blindness and enhancing vision capabilities, potentially giving humans the ability to see beyond the visible spectrum. Tellurium is a byproduct of copper refining and has excellent photoelectric properties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, threatening economic stability. The findings highlight the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare duties on women, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

Venture capitalists have sparked debate by suggesting that European startups need to embrace overwork to compete globally. However, many founders argue that this approach is unsustainable and clashes with European values, emphasizing the importance of work-life balance and sustainable innovation. They contend that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources rather than increased working hours to compete with the U.S. and China.</p>
