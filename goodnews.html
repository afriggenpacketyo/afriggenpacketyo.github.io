        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A street in central Berlin, long criticized for its racist name, is set to be officially renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate in the 18th century. The change comes after a protracted legal battle where residents' lawsuits attempting to block the renaming were ultimately dismissed by a Berlin-Brandenburg court. Civil society groups have advocated for this change for decades, highlighting the name's connection to Germany's colonial history and the enslavement of African people. The renaming ceremony coincides with the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition.</p>

          <h2>"South Park" Praised for its Satirical Approach to the Second Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 05:02:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 27th season of the animated series "South Park" is being highlighted for its effective and humorous satire of the second Trump administration, a feat many other comedy shows have struggled with. The article suggests that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone succeed by avoiding preachy moralizing and instead using mean-spirited, gratifying caricatures of figures like Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem. Rather than a direct impression, Trump is depicted using repurposed photos and the same animation style previously used for Saddam Hussein. This approach allows the show to land its political commentary without seeking audience approval, making it a notable voice in contemporary satire.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has initiated an overhaul of the iconic White House Rose Garden, replacing the central lawn with stone paving to create a patio-style event space. The renovation, which costs $1.9 million and is funded by private donations, was reportedly motivated by a desire to prevent guests' high heels from sinking into wet grass. The new design, featuring paving stones and yellow-and-white striped umbrellas, bears a strong resemblance to the Beach Club at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. While the changes are jarring to some, the White House Historical Association notes that the residence has always evolved with different administrations.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Japan should pursue cooperation rather than competition with China regarding major infrastructure initiatives across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Japan recently relaunched an economic zone initiative for the Indian Ocean and Africa, which risks clashing with China's established Belt and Road Initiative. The author contends that competition could lead to wasted resources and incompatible technical standards. Instead of nationally sponsored projects, the piece advocates for using multilateral development banks to finance and manage international infrastructure, fostering collaboration and more efficient development for the regions involved.

In the men's game, the dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz continues, with the two having contested multiple major finals this year. The article notes that the gap between them and the rest of the field appears to be growing, with questions surrounding whether an aging Novak Djokovic can still challenge for the title.</p>

          <h2>Turkey Considers Regulating Hotel Buffets to Combat Food Waste</h2>

          <p>Advisors to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are reportedly considering new regulations aimed at reducing food waste, with a particular focus on the country's popular and expansive all-you-can-eat hotel buffets. According to the Waste Prevention Foundation of Turkey, the nation discards approximately 8.7 million tons of food annually. One proposal suggests allowing guests to customize their breakfast packages instead of receiving a standard, large spread, much of which goes uneaten. While the plan aims to address a significant environmental and economic issue, some tour operators are skeptical the regulations will be implemented.</p>

          <p>Kira Chathli, a 26-year-old cricketer, has become one of the leading run-scorers in the women's Hundred competition despite initially being unsold in the draft.

Her recent success is attributed to a renewed focus on strength and conditioning, which has allowed her to hit the ball harder and more consistently. A chemistry graduate and co-founder of a coaching academy, Chathli's fearless and tactical approach to batting has helped her prove she can perform on cricket's biggest stage.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, the 30-year-old co-founder of Scale AI, has become the youngest self-made woman billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Despite her wealth, she maintains a rigorous daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, double workout sessions, and working through lunch. Guo advocates for a relentless work ethic, suggesting that new founders need to work 90-hour weeks to succeed and that a "9 a.m. to 9 p.m." schedule still allows for a work-life balance. Her perspective embodies the demanding "always-on" work culture often associated with Silicon Valley, a view that some other entrepreneurs have criticized as outdated.</p>

          <p>Paige Louise Williams, founder of the beauty brand P.Louise, has built a global empire with a projected revenue of £138 million this year, starting from a £20,000 loan from her grandmother a decade ago. Initially struggling after opening her first salon, Williams pivoted to offering online makeup classes and then developed her own product line. The brand's growth was massively accelerated by its success on TikTok Shop, where it broke a UK record for revenue generated in a 12-hour period. From a council estate in Greater Manchester, the 32-year-old entrepreneur is now preparing to open her first retail store.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funding from dozens of cities and counties over their "sanctuary" policies, which limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge extended a preliminary injunction, protecting jurisdictions like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles from having their funds cut off or conditioned on immigration compliance. The ruling blocks executive orders that directed federal agencies to penalize sanctuary communities. The judge described the administration's efforts as an unconstitutional "coercive threat" against state and local governments.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres secured a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, bringing the two teams into a tie for first place in the National League West division. Despite a strong seven-inning performance from Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell, the team's offense struggled, managing only three hits against Padres starter Yu Darvish and the bullpen. The Dodgers' only run came from a third-inning solo home run by rookie Alex Freeland. The loss squandered the division lead the Dodgers had built just a week prior, setting up a high-stakes series for control of the division.</p>
