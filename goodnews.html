        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a bill enacting President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, increased military and immigration enforcement funding, and cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. To secure votes, Republican leaders accelerated Medicaid work requirements and repealed clean energy tax credits. The bill would lock in the 2017 tax cuts, offer new temporary tax cuts, and increase taxes on universities and some non-citizens. Senate Republicans plan to modify the House version, with disagreements remaining over state and local tax deductions and the extent of Medicaid and clean energy program cuts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is set to celebrate its 250th birthday with a large-scale parade in Washington, D.C., featuring marching troops, tanks, and aircraft, coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The parade will include historical reenactments, military vehicles, and a Blue Heeler dog named Doc Holliday from the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment. The event aims to strengthen the connection between America and its Army, with officials estimating the cost to be significant but dwarfed by the service and sacrifice of American soldiers.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly approving waivers for states to eliminate junk food and sugary drinks from food stamp programs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that Nebraska, Indiana, and Iowa have already signed waivers, with more states expected to follow suit. This initiative aims to ensure that SNAP benefits are used for nutritious food, aligning with the program's original intent. Other GOP-led states, such as Texas and West Virginia, have also applied for waivers, reflecting a broader effort to restrict the purchase of unhealthy items with taxpayer-funded assistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling that suggests Federal Reserve board members have special protection against presidential firings, while allowing President Trump to remove members of other federal agencies' boards for now. The three liberal justices dissented, arguing that the ruling undermines the independence of bipartisan administrative bodies. Justice Kagan criticized the majority for creating a bespoke Federal Reserve exception, while the majority said the Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured entity with a distinct historical tradition. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that he would not resign if asked by Trump, asserting the president's lack of authority to fire him.</p>
