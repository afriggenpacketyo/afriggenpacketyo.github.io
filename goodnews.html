          <p>Following the congressional passage of his administration's major tax and spending bill, President Trump held a victory rally in Des Moines, Iowa. He touted the legislation as the "best birthday present for America," highlighting what he called the largest tax and spending cuts in the nation's history. During the event, Trump also previewed plans for next year's "America 250" celebration, which will include a UFC fight on the White House lawn and a new National Garden of American Heroes. He celebrated the bill's passage and recent military strikes on Iran as a sign of his administration's success, framing it as a significant political achievement.</p>

          <p>Actress Jane Seymour, at 74, attributes her consistent physique, which she says is the same as when she was 17, to a mindful and sustainable lifestyle rather than extreme diets. She detailed her daily routine, which typically involves skipping breakfast, having a substantial lunch of fish and vegetables, and snacking on healthy options like sweet potatoes and nuts. For exercise, Seymour focuses on gentle, technique-driven workouts like Pilates and Gyrotonics, emphasizing core strength to prevent injury, particularly due to a past back surgery. She advocates for consistency and listening to one's body over intense, potentially harmful routines, promoting a message of self-care at any age.</p>

          <p>A previously lost, handwritten letter by Thomas Jefferson from 1783 has been uncovered and is being offered for sale. In the letter, addressed to Virginia's governor, Jefferson discusses the right of citizens to take up arms against their rulers, drawing parallels between the American Revolution and rising revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He specifically notes the commotion in the Dutch states, where citizens were demanding the right to be armed. The document, valued at approximately $90,000, provides a unique insight into Jefferson's views on democratic movements and the importance of an armed citizenry in opposing autocracy shortly after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.</p>

          <p>A North Korean civilian has been taken into custody by the South Korean military after successfully crossing the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The man was detected by surveillance equipment near the Military Demarcation Line, prompting a 20-hour operation by South Korean troops to track and safely guide him to safety. Defections across the land border are rare due to the dense vegetation and extensive minefields. The individual, who willingly followed the guiding troops, will now be investigated by relevant authorities to determine the circumstances of his high-risk border crossing, a standard procedure for all defectors from the North.</p>

          <p>As the United States celebrates its 249th anniversary, an NPR article explores the diverse and personal meanings of freedom for Americans today. The piece commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence while acknowledging the nation's evolution from a time when its ideals of equality did not extend to all. For many, freedom now encompasses not just rights but also a sense of safety, self-determination, and a collective responsibility to advocate for the liberties of others. The article highlights how, for communities historically denied full participation, the concept of freedom is deeply intertwined with gratitude for past struggles and a commitment to continued progress.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed dozens of 300,000-year-old wooden artifacts at the Gantangqing site in China's Yunnan province, providing the first substantial evidence of a sophisticated 'Wood Age' in East Asia. This significant discovery helps fill a major gap in the understanding of Palaeolithic tool use, as wood typically decomposes and leaves little trace in the archaeological record. The well-preserved tools suggest that early humans in the region widely used wood for various purposes. The finding, published in the journal Science, is being hailed as a world-class discovery that reshapes knowledge of ancient human technology and adaptation in the region.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright orange glow and a loud bang reported by dozens of residents in the Scottish Highlands. Security cameras captured the event, allowing UKMON to calculate a potential landing zone between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht. While finding the meteorites in the vast, mountainous terrain will be challenging, the organization is appealing to hillwalkers to be on the lookout for the rare space rocks.</p>

          <p>China's national medical products regulator has announced a series of measures to support the development and application of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for medical use. The agency plans to strengthen research on standardization for key components like flexible electrodes and promote studies on the safety and efficacy of BCI-based medical devices. This official backing is expected to accelerate innovation in a field with immense potential for healthcare. Researchers hope BCI technology can help restore motor function for individuals with impairments from strokes or spinal cord injuries, and potentially treat conditions like cerebral palsy and ALS or even restore damaged sight and hearing.</p>

          <p>As heat waves intensify, many people are turning to hydration multiplier products, but medical experts advise caution. While these powdered supplements can be useful for replenishing electrolytes lost during prolonged, strenuous exercise, they are not a replacement for plain water, which remains the best source of hydration. Doctors recommend checking product labels for high levels of sugar, sodium, and caffeine, which can be problematic for individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. For most daily activities, experts suggest that water and a balanced diet are sufficient to maintain proper hydration without the need for specialized supplements.</p>

          <p>In an effort to bridge deep ideological divides, a diverse, bipartisan group of prominent figures has collaborated to draft a set of fundamental principles of American constitutional democracy. The project, titled "We Hold These Truths," brought together individuals like Stacey Abrams, former Republican governors, and retired judges to articulate shared values. Focusing on areas such as the rule of law, elections, separation of powers, personal freedom, and equality, the group reached a unanimous agreement on the principles. Released on the Fourth of July, the document is intended to serve as an educational tool and a reminder of the unifying values that underpin the nation.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: Reviving the Philosophical Defense of Liberal Democracy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that in an era of rising political polarization, the best defense for liberal democracy lies in the philosophical concept of "value pluralism," as articulated by thinker Isaiah Berlin. This idea posits that human values are inherently diverse and often in conflict, meaning no single utopian political system can satisfy them all. Because there is no one true path, society must prioritize individual freedom and democratic processes to allow people to choose how to balance competing values like liberty and equality. The author suggests that remembering this core justification is crucial for defending democracy against both left- and right-wing critiques that attack its foundational principles.</p>
