          <h2>China Agrees to Resume Seafood Imports from Japan After Fukushima Wastewater Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 23:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to lift its two-year ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was imposed due to concerns over the release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement, reached during a meeting in Beijing, requires Japan to register fishery processing facilities and ensure seafood is free of radioactive substances like caesium-137. China halted seafood imports in 2023, citing risks to its fishing industry and coastal communities after Japan began releasing treated wastewater that it claimed met international safety standards. The resumption of exports from areas outside the Fukushima region is expected soon after China completes necessary procedures.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. Kell Morris's wife held his head above water while waiting for rescuers, who were transported to the remote location by a sled dog tourism company's helicopter. It took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off Morris, who was hypothermic from the cold water. Morris spent two nights in the hospital for observation and acknowledged his luck and his wife's quick thinking in the ordeal.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for engaging in "fantasy economics" regarding their welfare policies. Badenoch's comments come after the Labour government indicated it was considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, while Farage also expressed support for removing the policy and providing more tax breaks for married couples. Badenoch argues that these leaders are advocating for taxpayers to fund unlimited child support, which the country cannot afford, and that Britain needs leaders who take economics seriously.</p>
