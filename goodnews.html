          <p>OpenAI has officially launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI technology, positioning it as a direct competitor to Google Chrome. The browser integrates ChatGPT into a companion sidebar on every webpage, allowing users to summarize content, ask questions, and perform tasks without switching tabs. CEO Sam Altman stated the goal is to rethink the browser experience, with features like an "agent mode" that can complete actions like booking flights for the user. Following the announcement, shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, dropped by approximately 3%.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, using weighted vests during exercise can increase calorie burn and heart workload but also carries risks. He advises that individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor before using them, as it acts as a mini stress test on the heart. To avoid injury, it is recommended to start with a weight that is only 5% of one's body weight and to ensure the vest fits properly to prevent stress on joints. While some users hope for bone health benefits, studies on this remain inconclusive.</p>

President Trump remarked on the project, stating it was something past presidents had dreamed of and that it is being fully funded by $250 million in private contributions. The addition is intended to host large events and state visits, with a planned capacity of nearly 1,000 people. The President assured that the new structure would be near the existing building but not touching it, paying respect to the historic architecture.</p>

          <p>China's commerce minister has agreed to an urgent meeting in Brussels to address escalating trade tensions with the European Union. The talks will focus on two key issues: China's recent move to tighten export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are critical for high-tech manufacturing, and a dispute over the Dutch government's effective takeover of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia. The EU's trade chief described China's restrictions as "unjustified and harmful," signaling the seriousness of the disagreements that the emergency talks aim to resolve.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team defeated Pakistan in a rain-plagued Women's World Cup match, a result that eliminates Pakistan from the tournament. The match in Colombo was repeatedly interrupted by weather, forcing the use of the DLS method to revise targets. Despite the disruptions, South Africa posted an imposing total of 312-9 in their 40 overs, propelled by three half-centuries. Pakistan was unable to meet the adjusted chase, securing South Africa's position at the top of the group table and ending Pakistan's hopes of advancing to the semi-finals.</p>

Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic uses an efficient walk-in model that eliminates scheduled appointments and other administrative burdens, allowing it to be financially self-sufficient. By focusing on a single payer, Medicaid, and providing free or low-cost care for the uninsured, the practice has created a sustainable model that provides accessible care to a vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat soared dramatically, gaining over 90% in a single day of trading. The massive rally was ignited after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have triggered a short squeeze on the heavily bet-against company. The surge marks a significant turnaround for the former penny stock, which had been underperforming for years. A new deal to expand distribution with Walmart also helped fuel the renewed investor enthusiasm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, top financial advisors are suggesting portfolio adjustments to navigate the changing economic landscape. Planners recommend considering intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with three- to seven-year maturities to lock in currently attractive yields before rates fall further. For stocks, the consensus advice is to maintain a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes rather than trying to time the market or chase performance in sectors that are historically sensitive to interest rates, such as small-cap stocks.
