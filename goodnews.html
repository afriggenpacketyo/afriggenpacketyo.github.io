          <p>All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, resolving litigation over the opioid crisis. The settlement ends the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and prohibits them from producing or marketing opioids in the U.S. The agreement, led by a coalition of states, aims to provide funds for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.

          <p>A review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales reveals critical flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the true scale of the issue. The report emphasizes the lack of reliable ethnicity data for perpetrators, with two-thirds of cases failing to record this information. Prime Minister Starmer has accepted the report's recommendation for a full national inquiry into child sexual exploitation. The report also suggests tightening laws to ensure adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault.</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving market for online sales of obesity drug alternatives, particularly compounded versions of drugs like tirzepatide and semaglutide. The FDA's decision that brand-name drugmakers can meet demand has ended the large-scale compounding era, prompting telehealth companies to adapt. Some companies are personalizing compounded drugs by adding supplements, testing the FDA's rules against making "essentially a copy" of available medications. Concerns remain about the safety and regulation of imported active ingredients used in compounding, as well as the ethics of marketing these drugs on social media.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris unexpectedly closed due to a strike by its staff, who protested unmanageable crowds, understaffing, and untenable working conditions. Gallery attendants, ticket agents, and security personnel refused to work, citing chronic issues that have overwhelmed the institution. The closure highlights the impact of global overtourism on the Louvre, which has struggled to accommodate its high visitor numbers. The museum is implementing a long-term renovation plan to address these issues, including a dedicated room for the Mona Lisa and a new entrance to improve visitor flow.</p>

          <p>At Home, the home decor and furniture retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring agreement to eliminate $2 billion in debt. The company, owned by Hellman & Friedman, has been struggling with rising tariffs and entered a forbearance agreement with lenders. As part of the restructuring, ownership is expected to transition to lenders holding over 95% of the company's debt. While the majority of stores will remain open, the company is aiming to improve its competitiveness in a volatile trade environment.</p>
