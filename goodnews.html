          <p>Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn has officially announced her bid for Tennessee governor, aiming to establish the state as a leading conservative stronghold for current and future generations. Blackburn, who made history as the first woman to represent Tennessee in the Senate in 2019, is now seeking to replace term-limited Governor Bill Lee. Her campaign strongly emphasizes her staunch conservative principles and close alliance with former President Trump, highlighting his return to the White House and stressing the need for robust conservative governors to implement national changes at the state level. This declaration sets the stage for a primary contest against fellow Republican Rep. John Rose, who announced his candidacy earlier in March, promising a competitive race for the governor's mansion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's exceeded Q2 earnings and revenue expectations, driven by successful promotions and a rebound in U.S. sales, reversing two quarters of domestic declines. Despite this improved performance, executives, including CEO Chris Kempczinski, expressed ongoing concern about the economic health of low-income consumers, who are crucial for frequent visits. The company is collaborating with franchisees to make core menu items more affordable, extending beyond previous deals. McDonald's anticipates stronger results in the latter half of the year, especially with easier comparisons to last year's E. coli outbreak impact, while international markets continue to show robust demand.

          <p>Homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options can leverage their home equity through HELOCs or home equity loans, which currently offer significantly lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of August 5, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.25% to 8.41% depending on the term, while the average HELOC rate is 8.26%. These rates are poised to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this year. Borrowers should compare offers from various lenders to secure the best terms, understanding that their home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure savings option with returns currently exceeding the inflation rate, allowing investors to lock in high rates for a fixed term. As of August 5, 2025, national average CD yields range from 1.68% to 2.03% APY, though top online banks offer much higher rates, such as 4.45% for 6-month CDs. The current inverted yield curve means short-term CDs often yield more than longer terms. Experts suggest laddering CDs to maximize returns and maintain liquidity, making them an attractive choice for safeguarding and growing savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, understanding current mortgage rates is crucial amidst high rates and limited housing inventory. As of August 5, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.78%, with 15-year rates at 6.00%. Refinance rates are similar, at 6.86% and 6.20% respectively. While higher than previous years, rates may stabilize if the Fed pauses hikes. Borrowers can secure better terms by improving their credit profiles and comparing offers from multiple lenders, ensuring they factor in all costs before committing to a loan.

          <p>Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy, is intensifying its direct-to-consumer sales, including its NovoCare online pharmacy, to counter cheaper compounded weight loss drugs and meet U.S. demands for lower prescription prices. CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen stated the cash channel is vital for market share and policy compliance, especially as President Trump mandates "most favored nation" drug pricing. Despite strong Wegovy sales, the company faces pressure from copycat compounders, impacting sales forecasts. Novo Nordisk believes its growing U.S. manufacturing presence positions it well to weather potential tariffs, indicating a strategic alignment with current administration priorities.

          <p>Disney reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, largely due to robust growth in its streaming business, particularly Disney+, and increased consumer spending at its theme parks. CFO Hugh Johnston noted the streaming unit's significant turnaround from previous losses, now providing a solid foundation. This success helps offset ongoing declines in traditional TV, which continues to lose customers. Disney also raised its fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS guidance, with Walt Disney World achieving its biggest third quarter ever, indicating strong consumer engagement despite broader economic concerns.

          <p>Italy has approved the 13.5 billion euro ($15.5 billion) construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would become the world's longest suspension bridge, linking Sicily to the mainland. This decision marks a political victory for Transport Minister Matteo Salvini, who champions the project as an economic accelerator for southern Italy. Despite concerns over earthquakes, environmental impacts, and potential mafia interference, preliminary work could begin this summer, with completion projected for 2032. The bridge is also controversially being classified as defense-related, potentially boosting Italy's NATO spending commitment, though critics warn of making it a military target.</p>

The combined entity, CSSC Holdings, will encompass military equipment, commercial vessels, and marine engineering, focusing on high-end vessels and phasing out less efficient operations.
