          <h2>Tsunami Advisory Issued for Southern Alaska Following 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 18:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory. Officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but do not expect large, widespread waves due to the quake's shallow depth. The event occurred in the seismically active "Ring of Fire," with multiple aftershocks reported, though major population centers like Anchorage were not in danger. The situation is being closely monitored by authorities.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a partially cleared minefield in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, who famously did the same 28 years prior. Visiting with the HALO Trust, the same organization his mother worked with, he highlighted the ongoing danger of landmines left from Angola's 27-year civil war. Harry emphasized that the remnants of war still threaten lives daily and called for a world where children can play without fear. The charity has destroyed over 120,000 landmines in Angola since 1994.</p>

          <p>Following discussions with President Donald Trump, Coca-Cola has reportedly agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its cola products sold in the United States. While the company did not explicitly confirm the change, it acknowledged Trump's enthusiasm and hinted at new product innovations. The move aligns with advocacy from figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have raised health concerns about corn syrup. Many consumers prefer the taste of cane sugar-sweetened Coke, which is already available in other countries like Mexico.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama made their first joint comments to dismiss persistent divorce rumors, using a lighthearted exchange on a podcast. Appearing on the "IMO" podcast with Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson, the couple joked about the speculation that their marriage was in trouble. Michelle Obama affirmed their strong bond, stating there has never been a moment she considered leaving him. The rumors had intensified after Barack Obama attended several high-profile events alone, which Michelle later explained was her choice to embrace personal freedom.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the earliest stages of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Telescope and the ESO's Alma telescope, scientists detected the mineral silicon monoxide, which forms at very high temperatures near a protostar and is a key building block of planets. This discovery provides a direct glimpse into a process similar to how our own solar system began, offering crucial insights into the dawn of planetary creation. The system is still in its infancy, at only about 100,000 years old.</p>

Eight babies, now developing normally, have been born using this procedure, offering hope to families affected by these often-fatal genetic disorders. The breakthrough is hailed as a major advance in reproductive technology, though it remains controversial due to the heritable genetic modification involved.</p>
