The central bank cited the need to monitor high housing prices in Seoul and household debt levels, even as it noted modest economic improvement. Concurrently, the BOK raised its 2025 forecasts for both inflation to 2% and GDP growth to 0.9%, signaling cautious optimism about domestic demand while remaining wary of the impact of U.S. tariffs on exports.

Pitching a full five innings for the first time this season since his recovery from surgery, he allowed only one run and recorded nine strikeouts. Ohtani achieved this by diversifying his pitch selection, relying more on his curveball and splitter, demonstrating an ability to navigate a lineup multiple times and solidifying his value as a crucial two-way player for the team's postseason ambitions.</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California has proposed a new multi-year extension to continue its century-old football rivalry with Notre Dame, addressing public concerns about its potential end. USC's athletic director, Jennifer Cohen, expressed optimism for a resolution, noting that the offer accommodates Notre Dame's preference for a long-term deal. The primary remaining obstacle in negotiations is the scheduling of the game, as USC seeks to move it to earlier in the season to better manage its Big Ten travel demands.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is transferring detainees from a controversial Florida immigration facility, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," following a federal judge's ruling. The judge ordered a halt to new construction and detainee transfers, and mandated the removal of equipment, siding with environmental groups who argued the facility violated federal laws. While the state of Florida is appealing the decision, the Trump administration is complying with the order to move detainees to other centers amid ongoing legal challenges concerning conditions at the site.</p>

          <p>In a civil trial where she is accused of assault, rapper Cardi B's defense was bolstered by testimony from a doctor's receptionist. The receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, told the jury she witnessed the plaintiff, a security guard, cornering the rapper and reaching for her during a 2018 confrontation. Cardi B has denied touching the guard, who is seeking $24 million in damages, and reiterated that she was the one who felt threatened during the heated verbal exchange.</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of China's central bank, has called for a cautious and multidimensional assessment of stablecoins amid growing global interest. He warned against the potential for these digital currencies to be used for excessive speculation, which could lead to fraud and systemic financial instability. His comments come as jurisdictions like the U.S. and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks, and they temper speculation that Beijing might soon introduce a yuan-backed stablecoin to promote its currency internationally.

          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious spending goal of 3.5% of GDP, which was agreed upon in June.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its AI chips. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst estimates. Nvidia's outlook remains robust, with an expected $54 billion in revenue for the next quarter, signaling that the global AI infrastructure buildout continues unabated. (not investment advice)</p>
