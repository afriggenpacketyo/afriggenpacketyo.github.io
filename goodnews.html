          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limits the ability of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his administration's policies. The ruling stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. Trump, alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi, framed the decision as a major victory against what he described as "radical left judges" attempting to overrule his presidential authority. He specifically praised the opinion authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom he appointed to the court, calling her work brilliant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic anxieties like inflation, tariffs, and job security. The U.S. personal saving rate rose to 4.5% in May, a significant increase from 3.5% in December, marking a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending." This cautious behavior is also reflected in record-high 401(k) contribution rates, as consumers prioritize building emergency funds. Financial experts see this as a defensive strategy to create a financial cushion against future uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi made a surprise return to the Glastonbury festival, two years after taking a break to focus on his mental health and Tourette's syndrome. His last performance at the festival in 2023 was cut short when he struggled with his voice, with the crowd memorably singing for him. On Friday, he told the emotional audience he wanted to "finish what I couldn't finish first time around." The comeback coincided with the release of his new single, "Survive," which addresses his personal struggles and determination to overcome them.</p>

It detonated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, with the energy equivalent of about 20 tons of TNT.

Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal is believed to contain exit clauses. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations are linked to the outcome of these talks. The potential move is significant due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' progress on the new engine regulations for 2026, which could make them a more competitive option for Verstappen.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a body that recommends which preventive health services insurers must cover at no cost under the Affordable Care Act. The challenge was brought by a group of Christian-owned businesses who argued the task force held unchecked power. Public health advocates had warned that invalidating the task force's recommendations could jeopardize access to crucial services like cancer screenings and HIV prevention drugs for millions of Americans. The ruling is a significant victory for supporters of the ACA and its provisions for no-cost preventive care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For a 65-year-old, a $300,000 immediate fixed annuity could generate between $1,684 and $1,942 in guaranteed monthly income for life, according to recent data. The exact payout depends on factors like gender and whether it is a single or joint-life policy, with men typically receiving slightly more due to shorter life expectancies. While annuities offer predictable income streams that can provide security in an uncertain economy, they also involve trade-offs such as limited liquidity and potential inflation risk. This article explains the key considerations for retirees thinking about this investment. (not investment advice)</p>
