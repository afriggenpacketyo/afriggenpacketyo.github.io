          <p>The U.S. and China have reached an agreement to temporarily ease tariffs, reducing them by 115 percentage points for 90 days, in an effort to de-escalate trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will be reduced to about 30%, while China will lower its levies on American imports to 10%. The news has significantly buoyed commodities and currency markets, with stock futures soaring, indicating a positive market response to the breakthrough in trade negotiations. Despite the temporary truce, some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term commitment and potential for a permanent agreement.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a 4% jump following the agreement between the U.S. and China to slash tariffs, which eased trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. U.S. crude oil rose to $63.54 per barrel, while Brent crude increased to $66.24 per barrel. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that further meetings are expected in the coming weeks to work towards a more comprehensive agreement. The reduced tariff rates, in place for 90 days, are intended to stimulate economic growth and boost demand for oil, providing relief to U.S. shale oil producers who require higher crude prices to maintain profitable drilling operations.</p>

          <p>Celebrity musicians, including Elton John and Dua Lipa, are protesting the UK government's proposed copyright law reforms that would allow AI developers to use copyrighted content for training their models. The artists have signed an open letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support an amendment requiring AI labs to disclose which copyrighted works they use. The current proposals would place the onus on artists to opt out of having their work scraped for AI training, a move that the creative industries argue undervalues their work. The musicians are advocating for transparency and licensing regimes to protect human-created content in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits the Middle East, the U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence chips has become a key point of leverage. Governments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the U.A.E. are eager to invest in data centers but require U.S. approval to purchase American-designed A.I. chips. The Trump administration is more inclined to use access to these chips to strengthen strategic bonds in the region. Deals involving companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are expected, with executives scheduled to meet with Saudi ministers and White House officials to discuss A.I. partnerships.</p>
