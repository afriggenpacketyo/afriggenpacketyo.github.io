          <p>The UK's Spending Review has outlined increased spending for Scotland in areas such as defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. Chancellor Rachel Reeves allocated ¬£250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, ¬£750m for a supercomputer in Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus. The review balances competing priorities, scrutinizing spending lines and setting new priorities, while also accounting for existing commitments. The changes in day-to-day spending and capital projects will affect Holyrood's budget through a formula that applies a share of the change to the block grant passed from the Treasury to Holyrood.</p>
