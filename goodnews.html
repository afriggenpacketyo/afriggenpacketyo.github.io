          <p>Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly stated that Canada seeks closer ties with the UK, EU, and other nations, reducing its reliance on the US. This initiative follows recent tensions with the US, including tariffs imposed by President Trump. Joly emphasized Canada's desire to assert its sovereignty and negotiate a new trade and security partnership with the US. Despite the unpredictability of the White House, Canada is committed to defending its interests and fostering stronger international relationships, including hosting the G7 summit in June.</p>

          <p>Part of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being stuck in orbit for over half a century. The lander probe, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, may survive re-entry due to its robust heat shield and durable structure. While the risk to people on the ground is low, the capsule could land anywhere between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world. Experts emphasize that the likelihood of being impacted by the debris is minimal.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Expected to Cut Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 19:01:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, potentially reducing them to 4.25% from 4.5%, with further reductions predicted later in the year. This move would lower borrowing costs for businesses and individuals but may also result in lower returns for savers. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is closely monitoring inflation, aiming to keep it near the 2% target. Economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariff policy, may influence the MPC's decisions regarding future rate cuts.</p>
