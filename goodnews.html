          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending escalating tensions that followed an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, as announced by Pakistan's Foreign Minister and confirmed by Indian officials. President Trump initially revealed the agreement on social media, stating the US mediated the talks. Secretary of State Rubio confirmed that Vice President Vance and he engaged with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker the ceasefire. The agreement comes after days of cross-border fire and strikes, with both sides accusing the other of provocations and misinformation, though Indian officials deny any damage to military infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After escalating tensions and attacks, India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire following mediation talks led by the U.S. The conflict stemmed from a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in April, leading to missile and drone strikes between the two nations. President Trump announced the ceasefire, stating both countries had used "Common Sense and Great Intelligence." The rivalry between India and Pakistan centers on the Kashmir region, which has been a point of contention since the partition of India in 1947, with both nations claiming the entire territory but controlling only parts of it.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the implications of rapidly falling birth rates and family formation in the US and globally, arguing that this demographic shift is becoming increasingly politicized. It contends that ensuring economic and societal support for people's decisions about having children is crucial and should not be surrendered to culture wars. The author suggests that policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare could align with progressive priorities and potentially increase birth rates. The author argues that a shrinking population will have many negative effects on the economy, the environment, and society as a whole.</p>

Cardinal Nichols noted that the experience allowed him to be more reflective and patient, and expressed that everyone involved was peaceful and focused on doing the process well.

          <p>A spear tip carved from bone, discovered in Russia in 2003, has been dated to 80,000 years old, indicating it was crafted by Neanderthals rather than modern humans. This finding suggests Neanderthals had advanced bone-working techniques beyond simple stone tools, independently developing technologies previously attributed only to Homo sapiens. The discovery adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals possessed sophisticated skills and cognitive abilities. The exceptional preservation conditions in the Mezmaiskaya Cave allowed for the long-term survival of the bone tool, providing valuable insights into Neanderthal technology.</p>

          <p>The Langenhop family, whose three children were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare immune disorder, found hope through a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy. The therapy, developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals, essentially allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor, making it safer than a bone marrow donation. All nine patients in the trial, including the Langenhop children, produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections, and none have had severe infections since their treatment. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are thriving and living normal lives, and the therapy is now under review with the FDA.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean after being stranded in Earth's orbit for 53 years. The event is a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved several milestones in exploring Venus. The re-entry highlights the increasing frequency of objects falling from the sky due to the growing number of launches, though most go unnoticed. The event also serves as a reminder of the vast amount of space debris still orbiting Earth from the early days of space exploration.</p>

The coaching staff will teach drills directly related to the Chargers' scheme and evaluate each prospect compared to his counterparts.
