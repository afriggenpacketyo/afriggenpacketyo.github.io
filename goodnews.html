          <p>The Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2, largely due to a dominant performance by pitcher Garrett Crochet. While Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw struggled, allowing four runs, Crochet effectively managed the game, striking out ten batters and stranding multiple runners. The Dodgers' only scoring came from first-inning solo home runs by Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Despite some late opportunities, the Dodgers' offense was ultimately stifled by Crochet's consistency, setting up a rubber match for the series finale.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially designated "drone flight planner" as a new occupation. This role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations.

Critics argue that using flawless, digitally created figures undermines industry efforts toward diversity and inclusivity. The company behind the AI model defends its work, stating it offers a new marketing choice, but acknowledges the technology is not yet advanced enough to create plus-size models.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis came as a relief, as it avoids the possibility of a long-term layoff that could have required major surgery. Judge received a platelet-rich plasma injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days, after which he hopes to initially return as a designated hitter. The injury occurred while making a strong throw during a game.</p>

The show's success, which predated hits like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," was rooted in its blend of a famous family's life with relatable domestic situations.

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, a psychologist explains the intense physical and emotional reactions experienced during high-stakes football matches. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, causes an increased heart rate and a "fight or flight" sensation, especially for the most loyal fans. Experts advise managing these effects by getting enough rest, having a clear match day plan, and engaging in movement to release energy. Ultimately, they suggest reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system, which has allowed a low-pressure system to persist over the region, leading to unrelenting cloud cover. This pattern has also increased coastal upwelling, bringing colder ocean water to the surface and further cooling the air. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters warn that hotter temperatures could still arrive later in the season.</p>

Under the proposed changes, developers building new residences near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas in designated locations. The government hopes these changes will revitalize struggling town centers and make it easier to open new bars in disused retail spaces.</p>
