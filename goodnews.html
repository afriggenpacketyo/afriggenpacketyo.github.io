          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on her 2015 decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees, stating it was guided by humanitarian principles. In an interview for an upcoming documentary, Merkel acknowledged the policy's challenges and its contribution to the rise of the far-right AfD party. Despite criticism, she maintains the decision was morally necessary, emphasizing that using force to prevent entry was never an option. Integrating the large number of refugees continues to be a significant challenge for Germany.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., students are returning to school amidst President Trump's deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops, a move D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser deems unnecessary. Bowser insists local agencies are capable of ensuring student safety, highlighting recent improvements in proficiency rates. While some local law enforcement find the federal presence helpful, concerns about the use of troops and their impact on community trust persist. Philadelphia is also focusing on local safety initiatives, including 'safety zones' and community programs, as its students return to classrooms.</p>

          <p>After decades of right-handed dominance, a new generation of left-handed tennis players, including Ben Shelton and Jack Draper, is showing potential to challenge the sport's top ranks at the US Open. Historically, lefties like John McEnroe and Rafael Nadal have leveraged their unique angles and spins to confound opponents. Shelton, currently world No. 6, and Draper, who recently won his first Masters title, are among those aiming to break the stranglehold of players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Their powerful serves and all-around game could signal a significant shift in the sport's competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' school system, now almost entirely charter-based, has seen significant improvements in test scores and graduation rates. This transformation, driven by state takeover and a focus on accountability, replaced a struggling pre-Katrina district plagued by mismanagement. While research indicates positive academic outcomes, opinions on the all-charter system remain mixed, with concerns about equity and parental navigation. The system continues to evolve, with some advocating for the district to directly run more schools to address ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>Weighted vests are a popular fitness trend, with influencers claiming benefits for posture, weight loss, and bone/muscle growth, especially for women in menopause. However, research largely does not support claims of significant improvements in bone density and muscle strength from simply walking with a weighted vest. Experts emphasize that traditional resistance training with substantial weight and full range of motion is far more effective for building strength. While weighted vests can offer cardiovascular benefits by increasing calorie expenditure, they should not replace proven strength-building exercises.</p>

          <p>Ashley Ludlow recounts a profound act of kindness from an unsung hero: a nurse who called her after her mother's death. In 2005, during Hurricane Katrina, Ludlow faced the agonizing decision to issue a 'Do Not Resuscitate' order for her mother, who had attempted suicide. Days after her mother's passing, a male ICU nurse called to assure Ludlow that her mother had died peacefully and without pain. This call alleviated immense guilt and provided comfort, leaving a lasting impact on Ludlow's life.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka is expected to miss up to four weeks due to a hamstring injury sustained in Saturday's match against Leeds United. This injury will keep the 23-year-old out of Arsenal's upcoming game against Liverpool and England's World Cup qualifiers next month. Captain Martin Odegaard is also doubtful for the Anfield match with a shoulder injury. Despite these setbacks, Arsenal remains optimistic that neither player will face a long-term absence, thanks to the team's deeper attacking talent this season.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest rate since January 2021. This moderation was driven by falling retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, below forecasts. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain moderate, citing easing global crude oil and food commodity prices, and slower nominal wage growth. This trend strengthens the case for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting to buffer against weaker economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
