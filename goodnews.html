          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner champions defender Maya Le Tissier, emphasizing her consistent excellence in the Women's Super League and her pivotal role in the club's recent Champions League debut victory. Despite her impressive club form, including a decisive penalty conversion and anchoring the defense, Le Tissier has received limited international recognition with only eight caps since her first call-up in November 2022. The article highlights how injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze present a strong opportunity for her to secure a starting position in the upcoming squad. Skinner firmly believes she is an "incredible footballer" ready to become an England stalwart, underscoring her readiness for a greater international role and contributing to the team's success.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "first Phase" peace deal between Israel and Hamas, which aims for the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to an "agreed upon line." This significant agreement, mediated by Egyptian and Qatari officials, follows two years of intense conflict initiated by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack. The article details Trump's 20-point peace plan, which also includes the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the establishment of a temporary technocratic governance for Gaza. This development is heralded as a crucial step towards de-escalating the devastating war and fostering long-term peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project during their recent meeting in Washington. Carney raised the issue in the context of broader trade discussions, and Trump was receptive to the idea, despite the company behind it having previously "moved on" from the project. This article highlights that the conversation was preliminary, with both leaders instructing their teams to continue discussions. The pipeline, which would transport oil from Alberta to Nebraska, has historically faced significant environmental and political opposition, having been blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator dismissed concerns that the company's significant deals with other AI giants, like OpenAI and Meta, constitute "circular investments," labeling the narrative as "fundamentally flawed." He asserted that major technology companies are genuinely purchasing cloud infrastructure due to immense market demand, not a circular money flow. CoreWeave, which went public earlier this year and has seen its stock soar over 200%, recently secured multi-billion dollar contracts, including a $22.4 billion agreement with OpenAI and a $14.2 billion deal with Meta. This article details Intrator's argument that these transactions represent a legitimate and massive infrastructure buildout driven by overwhelming market forces. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with minutes from their September meeting revealing ongoing divisions over the best path for monetary policy. While a majority supported a quarter-point reduction, the first since December 2024, citing growing risks to the job market, others expressed concern over persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target. This article highlights that only one official formally dissented, advocating for a larger half-point cut, but "a few" policymakers considered keeping rates unchanged. These differing views underscore Chair Jerome Powell's statement that there are "no risk-free paths now," suggesting a potentially slower approach to future easing. (not investment advice)</p>
