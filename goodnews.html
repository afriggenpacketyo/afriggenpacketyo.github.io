          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE detention after over three months, reiterated his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights in an interview. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, was detained in March, with the Trump administration citing national security concerns. Judge Farbiarz issued an injunction against the detention, leading to Khalil's release after the government alleged misrepresentation on his green card application, which Khalil denies. Khalil asserts that his activism, which goes against the administration's agenda, is the reason for his detention and vows to continue advocating for Palestinians despite potential future detentions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to oil and gas supplies, leading to volatility in energy prices. While initial price surges have subsided amid speculation that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, ongoing tensions could still squeeze global oil supplies. Experts suggest that Israeli airstrikes on Iranian oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on Iraqi facilities pose a greater risk to the region's oil supply. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though considered unlikely, could send prices soaring and significantly impact economies dependent on Middle Eastern oil (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pixar's latest film, "Elio," experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, grossing $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. This disappointing performance highlights the challenges that original animated films face in attracting audiences in the post-pandemic era, especially when competing with established franchises and live-action remakes. While "Elio" received positive reviews, analysts suggest that marketing and timing may have contributed to its soft opening, as families have limited summer weekends to choose from and may be more familiar with existing intellectual properties. Despite the setback, Disney remains committed to producing original animated content alongside sequels and franchise extensions.</p>

          <p>Despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, a top U.S. analyst believes that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it. Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, suggests that China's approach would prioritize quiet negotiations and its own self-interest over direct military intervention. He points to China's past agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of its focus on protecting its own interests rather than policing global waterways. This suggests that economic interests would shape China's approach.</p>

          <p>Following Iran's missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties, President Trump suggested that Iran may be willing to negotiate in earnest. If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire, potentially leading to a scenario where his high-risk strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities pay off. This situation echoes a similar dynamic in 2020 when the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iran launched missiles at military bases in Iraq. The initial reports indicate that all the Iranian missiles directed at the U.S. base in Qatar were intercepted.</p>

Caruso, a valuable player off the bench for both championship teams, also had to teach his new teammates how to properly pop champagne in celebration. Caruso was traded to Oklahoma City for guard Josh Giddey last summer.</p>

          <p>The RAF has evacuated 63 British nationals and their dependents from Israel as the country continues to exchange fire with Iran. The flight left Tel Aviv on Monday afternoon, taking vulnerable Britons and their immediate family to Cyprus, from where they will be taken to the UK. A British national was also injured in Israel during an Iranian missile attack. The Foreign Office said further flights would be based on demand and the security situation, urging British nationals still in Israel to register their presence with the UK government.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is ceasing service at Miami International Airport, with the last flight scheduled for September 3. The decision is part of a broader effort to cut costs by eliminating less profitable routes, as outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty. While JetBlue will no longer operate out of Miami International, it will continue to serve South Florida through nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood International Airport. JetBlue customers with flights booked to or from Miami after September 3 will be offered alternative travel options or a full refund.</p>
