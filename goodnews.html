          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while the company's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. counterparts by a generation, state-of-the-art performance is still attainable through tactics like stacking and clustering. In an interview with People's Daily, Ren emphasized China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, ample electricity, and a developed information network. The comments come as the U.S. ramps up restrictions on China and Huawei, with new guidance suggesting that the use of Ascend chips anywhere could violate American export controls.

The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach. Introduced in 2003, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report highlights how paternity leave has not changed noticeably since its introduction more than two decades ago.</p>
