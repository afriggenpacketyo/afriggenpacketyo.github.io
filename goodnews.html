The network charged clients up to ‚Ç¨230,000 (US$260,790) to help them move to Germany, promising to assist them via an accelerated government scheme for skilled workers. Around 750 officers searched 38 properties across nine German states as part of the investigation, which began in October 2023.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a surprise 'no tax on tips' bill, which could allow workers to deduct all 'qualified tips' from 2025 through 2028, requiring that tips are reported to qualify. This bipartisan bill, supported by both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, aims to provide tax relief to tipped workers, primarily in restaurants, hotels, and courier services. However, analysts note that the benefits may be limited to moderate to middle-income workers, with little impact for those with the lowest earnings. The policy may also lead to issues like income misclassification and the introduction of tipping in new occupations. (not investment advice)</p>

The NFL has reported no injuries resulting from the play, but some coaches and executives have voiced concerns about its lack of skill and potential safety issues.

          <p>Former CIA chief of disguise Jonna Mendez revealed that the mask technology depicted in the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise is based on reality. Mendez explained that the CIA developed realistic masks capable of changing an agent's gender and ethnicity, and she personally demonstrated this technology to high-ranking officials. The masks could be applied quickly and without mirrors, although they had some limitations. However, she was more skeptical about the self-destructing messages depicted in the films.</p>

          <h2>Microsoft's AI Weather Model Offers Accurate Forecasts and Versatility</h2>

          <p>Microsoft has developed an AI weather model called Aurora that can make accurate 10-day forecasts quickly, according to a report in Nature. The model, already in use at a European weather center, can predict weather events, air pollution, and wave height. It's also designed to be easily adapted to forecast other Earth systems with available data. Aurora is faster than traditional models, returning results in seconds, but still relies on data and physics-based models for its starting points and reality checks.</p>
