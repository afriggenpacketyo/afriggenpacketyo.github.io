          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing plummeting approval ratings despite securing significant trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union. Opinion polls indicate that a majority of the British public, including a substantial portion of Labour voters, hold an unfavorable view of Starmer. While business leaders express satisfaction with the government's economic direction, domestic concerns over cost-of-living pressures and tax increases overshadow these international achievements. Critics suggest that Starmer's leadership style lacks charisma, hindering his ability to connect with voters despite his competence in securing trade agreements.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, a writer reflects on her obsession with zombie fiction, particularly the HBO series "The Last of Us," and how it serves as a distraction from real-world anxieties. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional apocalypse provides a temporary escape from the pressing issues of 2025. Drawing from a personal experience with grief, she explains how horror movies can offer a unique perspective and a sense of control. The author concludes that while terrifying, these alternate realities provide a necessary reprieve from the relentlessness of the real world.</p>
