          <p>The US Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of a heterosexual woman in a "reverse discrimination" case, making it easier for individuals from majority backgrounds to pursue workplace discrimination claims. The court revived the case of Marlean Ames, who alleged she was denied a promotion because she is heterosexual, sending the case back to lower courts. The ruling comes amid debates over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, with conservative groups challenging DEI measures in the workplace. This decision may impact future cases involving claims of reverse discrimination.</p>

          <p>Turkmenistan has announced a significant reduction in the gas fire raging at the "Gateway to Hell" for half a century. Officials claim the fire, a major tourist attraction, has been reduced threefold through the drilling of wells to capture methane. The blaze, burning since 1971 due to a Soviet drilling accident, has been emitting massive quantities of methane. Despite Turkmenistan's claim, the country remains a significant methane emitter through gas leaks, a claim denied by authorities.</p>
