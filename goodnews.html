This development is part of an effort to create more accessible and affordable homeownership opportunities in the midst of the state's severe housing crisis. Officials hope this new model of for-sale ADUs will serve as a new generation of starter homes and be adopted by other cities.</p>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the Salton Sea's exposed shoreline accounts for less than 1% of the small particle pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. Researchers suggest that the numerous other pollution sources, like agriculture and diesel exhaust, mean that focusing on indoor air filtration may be more effective for public health. This challenges the long-held belief that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the area's severe respiratory health issues.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, confirming the return of standalone physical stores and hosting its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was sold to online retailer Asos, but is now aiming to recapture its former "cool" status. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract former customers, the brand faces challenges in appealing to a new generation of shoppers in a competitive market.</p>
