          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers playfully requested his 311-pound teammate, Broderick Jones, to stop tackling him after touchdowns, citing his age of 41. The request came after Jones tackled Rodgers following a touchdown pass against the Cincinnati Bengals. Despite the celebration, the Steelers lost to the Bengals, with Joe Flacco leading a game-winning drive. Rodgers, who threw for 249 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions, expressed excitement about facing his former team, the Green Bay Packers, for the first time since leaving for the New York Jets two seasons ago, while denying any animosity towards the organization. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm's path beyond that is uncertain, but it is not expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States. As of Wednesday night, Melissa was located about 335 miles south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and about 295 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, moving west at 1 mph with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. A hurricane watch is in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica, with rainfall forecasts predicting 5 to 10 inches in some areas. </p>

Microsoft and Google have secured contracts for AI and cloud tools, while Amazon Web Services received cloud-credit incentives during Trump's second term. Google's parent Alphabet will contribute $22 million to the Trust for the National Mall as part of a legal settlement, and Paolo Tiramani donated $10 million in stock.

          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.5% on Thursday, continuing a pause that began in May, while monitoring household debt and stability in the housing market. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and follows stricter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. The BOK cited stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook as reasons for the pause, but cautioned about uncertainties due to trade talks with the U.S. and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on exports. The central bank will maintain a rate cut stance to mitigate downside risks to economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former Chinese government policy advisor has urged China to avoid falling into Western "discourse traps" regarding issues like state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. He suggested that China should challenge "double standards" about its rise by being confident in defending the party's rule. The advisor noted that Western media often interprets China's achievements differently, leading to intense resistance and defensiveness. This approach risks alienating Global South countries, so it is important to have a confident defense of the party's rule. </p>

          <p>Early voter turnout in California's Proposition 50 special election, concerning the redrawing of congressional districts, has exceeded expectations. More than 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, with Democrats outpacing Republicans and unaffiliated voters. The effort is a Democratic-led attempt to counter Republican efforts to maintain control of Congress. Former President Obama has endorsed Proposition 50, stating that it will affect the entire country. The current trend shows Democrats having a slight edge over Republicans compared to their share of the California electorate. </p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are conducting clinical trials to target breast cancer "sleeper cells" to prevent recurrence. These cells break away from the main tumor and can resurface later to spread cancer throughout the body. The clinical trial identifies and attacks these dormant cells in the bone marrow using specific drugs. Early results from a trial involving 51 women showed a significantly lower rate of cancer recurrence after seven years. The next steps involve larger trials to confirm the findings and explore applications for other cancers. </p>

The son used the boat’s marine radio, which washed up on the island, to make a mayday call. The family was rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter and flown to a hospital. </p>

          <p>Menopause screening will be incorporated into NHS health checks in England, starting next year. Women undergoing these checks, offered to adults aged 40 to 74 every five years, will be asked about menopause symptoms. The goal is to identify women who may benefit from advice, support, and treatment options, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT). While the government aims to bring menopause into the mainstream, concerns have been raised about low health check uptake in some communities. </p>
