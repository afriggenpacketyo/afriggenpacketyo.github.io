        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is investing ¬£102 million to upgrade and expand over 1,000 GP surgeries across the country, marking the largest public investment in facilities in five years. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that these upgrades aim to address long waiting times and improve patient access, with projects set to begin this summer. The funding is intended to modernize facilities and create additional space for doctors to see more patients, shifting care from hospitals to community settings. This initiative is part of broader plans to overhaul the health service and tackle the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments, with nearly 45% of GP appointments occurring on the day they are booked.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested steep tariffs on movies produced overseas. This proposal aims to retain film and television production in the United States, building on California's existing state program. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal. The move comes amid confusion in Hollywood over Trump's call for tariffs, with some industry members expressing concern that tariffs would cause more harm than good and advocating for federal tax credits instead.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released after being detained during a citizenship interview, stated that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained under a rarely used law allowing the government to revoke visas for people believed to pose "adverse foreign policy consequences" due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. He views his release as a "light of hope" for other detained student activists.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States under a court order partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the nation's refugee admissions program. Judge Jamal Whitehead rejected the government's interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling, stating that it should continue processing refugees who had already been approved for travel to the U.S. The ruling is a victory for refugees and refugee aid groups, who argued that the suspension was unlawful and caused significant disruption.</p>
