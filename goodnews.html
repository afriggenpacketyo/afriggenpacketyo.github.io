          <h2>Study Suggests Doctors May Quickly Become Over-Reliant on AI Diagnostic Tools</h2>

          <p>A new study published in a prominent medical journal raises concerns about physicians' potential over-dependence on artificial intelligence. The research, involving gastroenterologists in Poland, found that doctors' ability to spot abnormalities like polyps during colonoscopies on their own decreased by about 20% after just a short period of using an AI-assisted system. While some experts are skeptical, suggesting statistical variations could be a factor, the findings point to a potential "safety-net effect" where clinicians subconsciously wait for AI prompts. This highlights the need for more research into how AI integration is changing real-world medical practice.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to gradually resume operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that disrupted travel for about 130,000 passengers daily. The new deal reportedly resolves a key issue by guaranteeing pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, a significant victory for the union. The airline has cautioned that a full restoration of its regular schedule may take a week or more. The resolution came after the union initially defied a back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in major European soccer clubs, driven by a 750% surge in league revenues over the past three decades. Americans now have investments in a majority of England's Premier League teams, including iconic clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool, with valuations reaching record highs. The trend is fueled by high wealth concentration in the U.S. and the relative affordability of European teams compared to NFL or NBA franchises. This influx of capital, often from private equity, has popularized multi-club ownership models, which are now facing increased scrutiny from regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese animated film 'Nobody' has become a surprise box office hit, surpassing Japanese blockbusters like 'Suzume' to become the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the country's history. As of Monday, the film had earned over 1 billion yuan (US$112.2 million), breaking the longstanding dominance of Japanese anime in this category. Based on a 2023 online animated series, 'Nobody' is praised for its unique aesthetic, which incorporates traditional Chinese ink-wash painting techniques. The film's supervisor explained that the style involves using ink to construct the shots, creating a distinct visual identity that has resonated with domestic audiences.</p>

          <p>New consumer research indicates that people are spending less at fast-food and casual restaurants this summer as high grocery prices continue to strain budgets. According to Worldpanel by Numerator, customer visits to these establishments fell by 6% in the three months to mid-July compared to the previous year. However, shoppers are not entirely giving up on indulgences; instead, they are replacing restaurant meals with smaller, branded treats from supermarkets. The report notes that while overall grocery inflation has slightly eased, consumers are still seeking savings, though coffee shops have bucked the trend with a 3% increase in visits.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, even after reporting quarterly earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations for the second consecutive quarter. The home improvement retailer anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year but noted that consumers are still in a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects. Despite the miss, the company saw encouraging signs, with big-ticket transactions over $1,000 rising by 2.6% and sales trends improving each month during the quarter. The company's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could spur more homebuying and renovation activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to nature-based solutions to manage the increasing threats of both intense rainfall and severe drought. By restoring wetlands and implementing "depoldering" projects that give rivers more space, authorities are creating natural buffers that can absorb excess water during floods and release it slowly during dry periods. This approach is part of a comprehensive regional flood management strategy known as the Sigma Plan. After initial resistance from landowners, the projects have gained local support by also providing new recreational spaces and vibrant nature reserves for the community.</p>

This move follows a similar strategy by other major retailers like Amazon and Walmart, allowing Best Buy to take a commission on sales without managing the inventory.

The project involved sheet mulching to naturally enrich the soil and installing a drip irrigation system.

As strong favorites, England has won all 27 matches since that final.

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a massive 113-year-old wooden church is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location in a spectacular two-day operation. The entire 672-tonne structure was hoisted onto giant trailers to transport it intact, as its original site is threatened by ground subsidence from over a century of iron ore mining. This move is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's center away from the unstable ground. The delicate process, watched by large crowds, involves moving the church with its valuable interior, including a large altar painting, still inside.</p>

The arrangement will involve selling 130 billion cubic meters of gas, worth up to $35 billion, to Cairo through 2040. This amended deal will allow for the expansion of production at Israel's giant Leviathan gas field and is expected to triple the country's total gas exports by 2028. The project strengthens Israel's position as a key regional energy supplier while providing Egypt with a stable supply for its power plants and growing LNG sector. (not investment advice)</p>
