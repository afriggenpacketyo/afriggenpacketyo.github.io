          <p>An excerpt from actor Tim Curry's new memoir, "Vagabond," reflects on his life, career, and the label of "vagabond" that he feels best defines him. Curry recounts a surreal experience being mistaken for an imposter at a screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the film that launched him to stardom. He discusses how an itinerant upbringing shaped his identity and reluctance to be pinned down, a quality that has informed his diverse roles. The excerpt also touches upon his 2012 stroke, assuring readers that while he is not a Hollywood tell-all, his story offers a mosaic of the man beneath the costumes.</p>

The film delves into the complexities of their relationship, where the lines between their on-stage act and private life often blurred, fueled by Jerry's ambition and Anne's resentment over her unfulfilled dream of being a serious actress. Utilizing newly discovered audio tapes his father secretly recorded, Stiller confronts his parents' struggles, including his mother's drinking, while also re-examining his own life and relationships in a deeply personal and revealing journey.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively banned women's sports, the Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to play internationally again in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series. The newly formed squad, comprising players now living in Australia, the UK, and Europe, will compete against Chad, Libya, and the UAE. For the players, the tournament is not just about football but also about representing the silenced women of Afghanistan whose human rights have been severely curtailed. This event marks a significant step toward readmission into the global football community and sends a powerful message of resilience and defiance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after the worst clashes since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The conflict had intensified after Pakistan was accused of carrying out attacks in Kabul, leading to cross-border strikes that resulted in dozens of civilian casualties. Under the new deal, the Taliban has reportedly agreed to stop supporting groups that attack Pakistan, with further talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>Following a recent policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," there have been no major military exercises conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) near the island. According to figures from Taiwan's defense ministry, PLA sorties in the week after the speech ranged from seven to 27 per day, a relatively low level of activity. This contrasts with previous large-scale drills, such as one involving 76 sorties, which Beijing had described as a "serious warning" to what it calls "Taiwan independence forces." The current calm suggests a period of observation from mainland China.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a strategy to create 400,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to double the workforce in renewables, wind, solar, and nuclear power. The plan prioritizes training for in-demand occupations like plumbers and electricians and includes establishing five "technical excellence colleges" to develop necessary skills. Special programs will target veterans, ex-offenders, and school leavers to fill these roles. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for reducing energy bills long-term and bringing well-paid, secure industrial jobs to communities across the country.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece praises two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges, Karin Immergut in Portland and April Perry in Chicago, are commended for rejecting the administration's rationale that the cities were "war-ravaged" or in a state of rebellion, with one judge calling the justification "untethered to the facts." The article contrasts their actions with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to the president. It argues that these rulings uphold the nation's tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs and are a crucial defense of constitutional law.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband Suggests Potential Cut to VAT on Energy Bills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 08:59:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he did not confirm a specific policy ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The suggestion comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, with Labour having previously pledged to reduce average bills by £300 a year by 2030. Miliband reiterated that the long-term solution to high bills is transitioning to home-grown clean energy.</p>

His optimistic forecast comes as Beijing prepares for a crucial party meeting to outline its next five-year plan, which will set key economic priorities amidst ongoing rivalry with the United States.

          <p>A Chinese robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has seen a dramatic increase in orders, which it attributes to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports. A company representative stated that clients are making emergency purchases to secure products before potential price hikes, leading factories to work overtime to meet the demand. This surge in business highlights an unintended consequence of the administration's aggressive trade policy, as American companies rush to stockpile Chinese-made components. The company jokingly thanked President Trump for his role as an effective, albeit unintentional, "sales consultant."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are encouraged to carefully evaluate their health and prescription drug coverage for the upcoming year. Experts advise against simply letting current plans auto-renew, as changes in provider networks, drug formularies, and costs could leave individuals underinsured. The ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information from official channels, prompting some advisors to suggest waiting until later in the enrollment period to finalize decisions. Key considerations include comparing the trade-offs between Original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, which often offer extra benefits but have more restrictive networks.</p>
