          <p>Residents of a Texan town, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX facility, have voted to rename their community 'Starbase,' formalizing its status as a city. The decision allows Starbase to control building permits, collect taxes, and create local laws, separating it from Cameron County regulations.  Musk celebrated the decision on X, stating that Starbase, Texas is now a real city.  Bekah Hinojosa from the South Texas Environmental Justice Network expressed concerns about potential environmental damage due to SpaceX operations in the area, fearing increased illegal dumping and destruction of wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's upcoming book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," delves into the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the 1992 film "Malcolm X." The excerpt details the meticulous recreation of Malcolm's life, from his early days as a hustler in Boston to his leadership in the Nation of Islam. Lee's commitment to authenticity led to the recreation of Dudley Square in Brooklyn and the use of various New York City locations to depict Malcolm's journey. The excerpt also highlights the symbolic use of music and camera techniques to convey Malcolm's premonition of his own death.</p>

          <p>This month marks the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, the charismatic and defiant Black leader who electrified America with his blunt talk and biting humor. Over his 39 years, Malcolm transformed from a street hustler to a Nation of Islam spokesman preaching racial separatism, eventually becoming a human rights leader reaching out to Whites of good faith. His famous phrase, "By any means necessary," has been interpreted as a call for self-defense and Black pride. The article discusses how Malcolm's influence has grown since his assassination, inspiring leaders of the Black Power and Black Arts movements, and how his views still resonate in today's fractious politics.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex, friend, or even a past version of the partner, conveys a message of inadequacy. Over time, such comparisons can lead to insecurity and questioning of self-worth. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper communication issues, such as fear of openly expressing needs, which can be addressed by creating a safe and emotionally close environment where partners feel comfortable communicating directly.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is not considering running for a third presidential term, clarifying earlier comments that fueled speculation about his intentions. He attributed the "good parts" of the economy to his policies and the "bad parts" to former President Joe Biden's economic management. Trump defended his tariffs, despite concerns about economic uncertainty, and expressed confidence that the U.S. economy would improve. The Constitution's 22nd Amendment limits presidents to two terms, requiring a constitutional amendment for any deviation, which would require two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the country's state-level governments.</p>

          <p>Reports suggesting widespread discontent among the U.S. workforce may be overblown, according to an expert who questions the validity of surveys used to define trendy terms like "quiet quitting" and "rage applying." These terms are often based on surveys conducted by HR firms with vested interests, using questionable statistical sampling methods. The reality is that many people are satisfied with their jobs and understand the pressures employers face, recognizing that work is work and the perfect job doesn't exist. Dissatisfaction can also be a positive sign of ambition, driving individuals to seek better opportunities or start their own businesses.</p>
