          <p>The Supreme Court has prolonged the suspension of the Trump administration's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans, pending further review by a lower court. This decision comes after intelligence agencies questioned the White House's justification for the deportations, with allegations that a Trump appointee instructed an intelligence official to revise an assessment. Other news includes a tornado in St. Louis causing fatalities and significant damage, and Moody's downgrading the United States' credit rating, potentially increasing consumer borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>The flat Earth theory, despite being debunked for over 2,000 years, has found its way into American politics, with individuals linked to the movement attracting attention in Alabama, Georgia, and Minnesota. While their reasons vary from spiritual convictions to skepticism of scientific consensus, the presence of such beliefs among political figures raises concerns about anti-intellectualism. Experts suggest the internet and social media have fueled the spread of these pseudo-scientific conspiracy theories, though there is no evidence of an organized flat-earther movement in U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump bypassing Israel during his Middle East tour, experts suggest his visit advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests, presenting a strategic opportunity for Jerusalem. Throughout the trip, Trump emphasized points reflecting Israeli priorities, such as condemning Hamas, advocating for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and cautioning Iran against nuclear ambitions. While some Israeli officials expressed concern about being excluded from the discussions, analysts argue that Trump's "America First" approach and continued support for Israel, particularly regarding Iran, could benefit the Jewish state if properly leveraged.</p>

          <p>The Mayo Clinic is using its fecal waste biobank to research how the microbiome impacts cancer treatment, aiming to personalize medicine by understanding how patients respond differently to medications. The biobank contains over 2,000 stool samples, and researchers hope to identify which drugs are most effective based on an individual's microbiome and genes. This effort is part of a broader movement to explore the role of the gut microbiome in cancer treatment, including fecal transplants and gene editing. The research comes amid concerns about potential funding cuts to scientific institutions.</p>

          <p>Violeta, an 18-month-old spider monkey, was rescued from a Vallejo home during a methamphetamine bust and is now receiving care at the Oakland Zoo.

Spider monkeys are endangered, and it is illegal to own them as pets in California, as they require specialized care.

          <p>As the NBA draft combine concludes, a columnist argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should focus on drafting a mature, experienced player who has demonstrated the ability to handle money and fame during their college career. The piece highlights how recent economic shifts in college sports, particularly the introduction of "name, image, likeness" (NIL) policies, have allowed players to monetize their college careers, providing opportunities to learn from mistakes before entering the higher-stakes world of professional sports. The columnist suggests the Lakers should consider drafting a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on their shoulders.</p>

These actions aim to protect essential city services, including sanitation, street repairs, and tree trimming. The committee's recommendations now proceed to the full council for consideration.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The scheme, intended to be reciprocal, aims to facilitate travel and study between the UK and EU countries without reinstating full freedom of movement. While details are still under discussion, the proposal seeks to improve business opportunities and living standards by easing post-Brexit restrictions, though some critics express concerns about uncapped migration.</p>

While a major new deal is not expected, the summit aims to address issues such as defence, easing administrative burdens for farmers, and strengthening security cooperation. Discussions will also cover topics including energy, migration, agriculture, and data sharing, with potential agreements on youth mobility, although fishing rights remain a contentious issue. The summit is seen as an opportunity to improve the existing Brexit agreement and enhance British living standards.</p>
