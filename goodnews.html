          <p>European Union officials are set to hold initial talks on a proposal to create a continent-wide anti-drone defense system, referred to as a "drone wall." The discussion, prompted by recent Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace, will involve about 10 EU countries, primarily those along the eastern border, as well as Denmark and Ukraine. The proposal gained momentum after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advocated for it following an incident where NATO jets shot down Russian drones over Poland. The initiative aims to leverage Ukraine's expertise in detecting and neutralizing drone swarms to bolster European security.</p>

          <p>Senior officials from the United States and China have agreed to increase communication to better manage disagreements between the two nations. The consensus was reached after a meeting in New York described by both sides as "candid, in-depth and constructive." During the talks, China's representative urged the U.S. to adhere to the one-China policy and uphold its commitments to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. This development aims to stabilize the relationship and expand areas of cooperation ahead of a potential summit between President Trump and President Xi.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, analysis focuses on whether Team Europe can break the trend of home-side victories and win on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012. Key factors likely to determine the outcome include the opening day's foursomes, where the winning team has dominated in the last five events. Europe's ability to manage the famously boisterous New York crowd and get a fast start will be crucial to preventing a 'bear pit' atmosphere. The European team holds a significant advantage in player experience, with 32 combined appearances to the U.S. team's 15, which could prove pivotal under pressure.</p>

          <p>During a farewell call for outgoing Chinese ambassador Huang Xilian, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that differences over the South China Sea should not define the two countries' relationship. Both sides reaffirmed the need to focus on trade, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people interactions. This sentiment echoes language from a 2023 joint statement, suggesting a mutual desire to de-escalate tensions and prevent maritime issues from overshadowing broader bilateral cooperation. The ambassador expressed hope that relations could be put "back on track at an early date," signaling a diplomatic effort to manage ongoing disputes.</p>

          <p>England's Ellie Kildunne, recently named world player of the year, has become a star of the Women's Rugby World Cup, known for her exceptional talent and charismatic personality. Her journey to the top was unconventional; without a girls' team to play for as a teenager, she focused on football before improvising her way into a county rugby trial. Kildunne's on-field brilliance is matched by her off-field ambition, with projects in photography, fashion, and podcasting, reflecting her motto to embrace passions at "full speed ahead." Recently diagnosed with ADHD, she views the condition as a "superpower" that fuels her creativity and focus.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP, which was the subject of intense takeover speculation five months ago, has seen its market position improve significantly. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since early April, outperforming many rivals, due to a strategic reset, a new leadership team, and recent oil discoveries. This strong performance has dampened talk of a potential acquisition by competitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth strategy to drive shareholder value, moving BP out of the takeover spotlight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the viral Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased to see a decline in the toy's inflated resale prices. After a summer where some editions sold for over 2,000% above retail, the secondary market is now cooling as the company ramps up production to meet demand, churning out 30 million plush toys monthly. Pop Mart claims the crash was desired, as its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans rather than fueling a speculative market for profit. Analysts see this as a strategic pivot toward a more sustainable, long-term business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has opened an international operations center for its digital yuan (e-CNY) in Shanghai, signaling a major push to promote the currency's use in cross-border payments. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unveiled three platforms designed to enhance the efficiency of international transactions and integrate the digital currency with blockchain services. A PBOC deputy governor stated that the evolution of digital monetary systems is a "historical inevitability." This initiative is part of China's broader strategy to offer an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system and increase the international footprint of the yuan.

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-20 in a dramatic finish, thanks to a 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. Seattle had built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but a late rally by Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, including a game-tying touchdown pass with 33 seconds left, seemed to force overtime. However, a penalty on the ensuing kickoff gave the Seahawks good field position, allowing quarterback Sam Darnold to connect on a key pass to set up the game-winning kick. The victory marks Seattle's eighth consecutive win over their NFC West rivals.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that he is prepared to step down from office once the war with Russia concludes. In an interview, he emphasized that his primary goal is ending the conflict, not securing another term. When asked directly, Zelenskyy confirmed he would push for elections in Ukraine if a ceasefire were established, even a temporary one of three to six months. Under the current state of martial law, elections are prohibited in Ukraine; Zelenskyy's original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, but the ongoing invasion has extended his presidency.</p>
