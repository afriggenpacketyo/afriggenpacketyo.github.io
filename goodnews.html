          <p>England and Wales face a difficult path in the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into what experts call the "toughest group" alongside France and the Netherlands. This places three top-11 ranked teams in the same group, creating high-stakes opening matches. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France is on an impressive winning streak, making progression for any team uncertain. Wales, as tournament debutants, are considered underdogs but hope to leverage that status to their advantage.</p>

          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the Nathan's Famous hot dog eating contest, demonstrating his intense dedication to the sport through rigorous training methods like yoga and neck exercises. The article reflects on the bizarre and compelling nature of the event, viewing it as a uniquely American spectacle of excess and will. It positions the contest not just as a competition but as a cultural commentary on consumption, ambition, and the strange forms modern entertainment can take.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in over a century, Paris has opened three designated swimming zones in the Seine River to the public, a legacy of the 2024 Olympic Games. The move follows a €1.4 billion project to improve water quality, which had been dangerously polluted since swimming was banned in 1923. Supervised by lifeguards, these free-to-access areas feature changing rooms and showers, allowing residents and tourists to cool off amid high summer temperatures. Officials will continuously monitor water safety to ensure a positive experience for swimmers.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team began their New Zealand tour with a hard-fought 29-26 win against the Maori All Blacks in a thrilling match. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately decided the contest in Whangarei. Despite being out-possessed, the Scottish side demonstrated clinical attacking and resilient defense, especially in the final moments. The victory was secured by a largely second-string squad, which held off a late Maori surge to start their tour on a positive note.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify 'Genetic Switch' for Organ Regeneration in Mice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 01:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough by discovering a "genetic switch" that enabled the complete regeneration of damaged ear tissue, including cartilage, in mice. The study, published in *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating a dormant gene, they successfully restored the lost tissue, offering hope that similar mechanisms could exist for other organs. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings provide a promising new avenue for regenerative medicine research.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is expected to miss about six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. The team is confident that Muncy will have sufficient time to return and regain his form before the playoffs begin. In the interim, the Dodgers will use internal options like Tommy Edman and Kiké Hernández to cover the third base position.</p>
