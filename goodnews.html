          <p>A federal judge has ordered Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil to be released on bail, more than three months after he was detained by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to his community, allowing his release during immigration proceedings. Khalil's arrest, stemming from his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, sparked demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The government initially invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but later cited failure to disclose information on his residency application as the reason for detention. The judge expressed skepticism of the government's requests to keep Khalil detained, paving the way for his reunion with his family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms. The warning covers parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is in place, warning of pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with health conditions. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires across England and Wales, prompting calls for caution when using barbecues and handling flammable objects. While the heatwave is record-breaking for 2025, temperatures are still below the June peak of 1976.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip expected on June 28. The initial rollout will feature a limited number of Model Y vehicles and access will be by invitation only. Trips to or from airports are excluded, service may be limited due to bad weather, and a Tesla Safety Monitor will sit in the front passenger seat. The rides are limited to a geofenced area of the city and remote drivers will monitor as a backup. Despite previous delays, Wall Street analysts believe robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, though setbacks are expected.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated on social media that his administration is working closely with Harvard University to strike a deal, with an announcement expected next week. He noted that Harvard has acted appropriately during negotiations and appears committed to doing what is right. Trump's post coincided with a federal judge granting a preliminary injunction to block the president's efforts to bar international students from attending Harvard. The Trump administration had previously taken actions against Harvard's international students, including disqualifying them from receiving visas, citing the university's failure to account for "known illegal activity" by students.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he could strike a "deal" with Harvard University within days to resolve his battles with the Ivy League school, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The judge's preliminary injunction bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Trump stated that Harvard has acted appropriately during negotiations and appears committed to doing what is right. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to deal with campus antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The median home sale price in the U.S. reached a record high of $396,500, but new data indicates that buyers are paying below asking price. Buyers are paying 6%, or $26,000, less than sellers' median asking price, as mortgage rates remain high and the inventory of affordable homes remains low. High housing costs and economic uncertainty have hurt demand, putting the onus on sellers to ensure their homes are in top shape and reasonably priced. While buyers can't expect a discount on every home, sellers may be willing to be flexible on price, especially as there are now more sellers than buyers in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florian Wirtz, a top Bundesliga performer at age 22, is potentially transferring to Liverpool, raising questions about his fit within the team's existing roster. Wirtz, a dynamic playmaker, excels as a number 10, possessing pace, awareness, and decision-making abilities. His best position is that number 10 central role, and his addition could require a reshuffling of Liverpool's lineup. The arrival of Wirtz could impact the playing time of players like Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister, while Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz appear secure in their wide positions. The team may also explore a 4-3-3 formation with Wirtz as a false nine.</p>
