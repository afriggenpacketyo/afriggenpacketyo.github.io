          <p>Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, is competing in the 2025 Miss Maine pageant but is currently losing the fan vote to Isabelle St. Cyr, the first transgender model to compete in the pageant. The online vote allows the public to vote for their favorite contestant for $1 per vote, with the winner gaining automatic entry into the pageant's semifinals. Hudson is running to represent Maine fishing families, while St. Cyr views her participation as a continuation of her fight for inclusion, drawing parallels to her experiences as a cheerleader. The Maine online vote page crashed on Saturday afternoon, so updated results are unknown.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that a 69-year-old man has been arraigned on a murder charge in San Jose, California, nearly 50 years after the strangulation death of Jeannette Ralston. Willie Eugene Sims was identified as the suspect through a thumbprint found on a cigarette carton in the victim's car, which matched his print after the F.B.I. upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm in 2018. Sims, who was stationed at Fort Ord in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery. The break in the case brings closure to Ralston‚Äôs son, who was six years old at the time of her death.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club is aiming to create the "best stand in the world" with its new Riverside Stand, featuring an eight-tier hospitality section, Michelin-star menus, and a rooftop pool. The stand, designed by Populous, focuses on the River Thames view rather than the pitch, drawing inspiration from rowing and boat houses. The facilities, more akin to a five-star hotel or cruise ship, will also function as a private members' club on non-matchdays. Fulham's chief executive emphasized the importance of sustainability and staying at Craven Cottage in the development.</p>

          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for excessive use of the riding crop during the race. The Kentucky Board of Stewards determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times, exceeding the permitted six times under Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules. The fine, doubled due to a prior violation, will go towards a jockey mental health program. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin, will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to compete in the Belmont Stakes.</p>

          <p>Five fishermen, including three Peruvians and two Colombians, arrived in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna boat, following 55 days adrift at sea. The fishermen had been missing since mid-March after reporting damage to their boat's alternator shortly after setting sail from Peru. The Ecuadorian navy is coordinating with authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. This rescue follows a similar incident earlier this year, where another Peruvian fisherman survived 95 days at sea before being rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying regarding President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with key issues and potential impacts on millions of Americans under scrutiny. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but the final version could undergo significant changes before a vote. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation," which requires navigating budget constraints and competing priorities. The narrow Republican majority in the House and the need for a fiscally responsible package add complexity to the process.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has pledged to donate most of his wealth by 2045 to address urgent global needs, expressing concern over cuts to USAID led by Elon Musk. Gates predicts these cuts will increase childhood deaths in poor countries, and described Elon Musk as a liar in response to Musk's defence on X. The Gates Foundation plans to double its giving to $200 billion by 2045, focusing on reducing child mortality, fighting diseases, and alleviating poverty. Gates' wealth stems from co-founding Microsoft, and he has since diversified his investments through Cascade Investment.</p>
