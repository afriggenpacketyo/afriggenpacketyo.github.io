          <p>Security researchers have uncovered over 19 billion leaked passwords from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025, with a staggering 94% being reused or predictable. The most common passwords, such as '123456' and 'password', remain prevalent despite years of warnings. Experts emphasize the importance of using password managers to generate complex passwords and enabling two-factor authentication to protect online accounts. Additionally, users are advised to keep software updated, avoid downloading from untrusted sources, and consider personal data removal services to minimize the risk of credential stuffing and account compromise.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affected southeastern France, causing disruptions to traffic and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival. Approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity after a high-voltage line failure. The outage occurred shortly after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes had already weakened the grid. While the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply, screenings at the Cineum were temporarily suspended.

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline, returning to pre-pandemic levels after a spike in 2020. The FBI's 2023 crime report indicates a nearly 12% decrease in murders year over year, with further declines in 2024 and early 2025. Cities like Baltimore, once synonymous with violent crime, have seen homicides fall to decade lows. Factors contributing to this decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors and government initiatives aimed at reducing community violence. Despite these positive trends, public perception often lags behind reality, with many Americans still believing that crime is on the rise.</p>

By focusing on Devon, a working-class outsider, the series dissects the bought intimacies of the wealthy.
