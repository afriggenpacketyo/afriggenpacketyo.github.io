          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 07:56:40 EDT</div>

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to convenience stores, which saw a 9% increase in morning traffic compared to fast-food's 1% rise in a recent three-month period. Chains like Wawa and Casey's are successfully attracting consumers with expanded food service options, convenience, and perceived value, chipping away at a market long dominated by giants like McDonald's. This trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, as budget-conscious diners find convenience stores to be a viable and varied alternative for their morning meals, reversing a dynamic where c-stores traditionally followed fast-food's lead.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant increase after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of stock. This substantial insider acquisition was interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence from Musk in the company's future. The purchase comes as Tesla faces challenges, including slumping sales and analyst uncertainty, but also as Musk pushes a vision for the company centered on AI, robotics, and autonomous driving.

          <p>Ruth Weiss, a celebrated Jewish journalist, writer, and anti-apartheid activist, has passed away in Denmark at the age of 101. Having fled Nazi Germany for South Africa as a child, her experiences with anti-Semitism and racism fueled a lifelong dedication to fighting for human rights and tolerance. As a journalist, she reported on the injustices of apartheid and befriended key figures in African independence movements, including Nelson Mandela. Remembered for her integrity, courage, and moral authority, Weiss continued to write and advocate for justice until the end of her life.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to sign a major nuclear energy agreement aimed at accelerating the development of new power stations and strengthening energy security. The partnership, to be finalized during President Donald Trump's UK visit, intends to halve regulatory approval times and unlock billions in private investment. A key component of the deal involves a plan for US firm X-Energy and UK's Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. While touted as creating thousands of jobs, critics point to the high costs and long timelines associated with nuclear projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of renters are reporting their monthly payments to credit bureaus as a strategy to build or enhance their credit history, according to a new TransUnion survey. This practice has been shown to be particularly beneficial for those with limited or no credit history, with participants seeing an average score increase of 60 points. While services that report rent can be a useful financial tool, especially for younger generations, experts advise consumers to consider potential costs and risks. It is important to verify if a service reports to all three major bureaus and to understand its policy on reporting late payments.</p>

          <p>China aims to significantly expand its energy storage capabilities, targeting over 180 gigawatts of "new-energy storage system" capacity by 2027, nearly double its current level. A new government action plan outlines a 250 billion yuan (US$35 billion) investment to support this goal, which is crucial for stabilizing the power grid as the country rapidly builds out renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The plan emphasizes the development of lithium-ion batteries but also includes support for alternative technologies such as hydrogen and compressed-air storage to meet its ambitious carbon-neutrality targets.</p>

          <p>A pioneering program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, provides unconditional cash transfers of $1,500 to every expectant mother, followed by $500 monthly for the infant's first year. New studies show the program has successfully lowered rates of maternal postpartum depression, reduced evictions, and improved infant health outcomes, saving millions in neonatal intensive care costs. Born from the advocacy that followed the city's water crisis, Rx Kids is the first universal, community-wide program of its kind in the U.S. Its success is generating bipartisan interest as a preventative, evidence-based approach to combating child poverty.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has launched an ambitious conservation project, Predator Free 2050, aiming to eradicate invasive species like rats, possums, and stoats that threaten its unique native bird populations. A key part of the strategy relies on a nationwide network of volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set and maintain traps in local parks and their own backyards. This community-driven approach is considered crucial for the project's success, as it tackles the problem on both public and private land. The effort highlights a difficult trade-off, accepting the need to kill invasive animals to save iconic native species from extinction.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service in the UK has dropped charges against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. Prosecutors informed the court that they would offer no evidence against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, stating the case did not meet the legal threshold for trial. Both men, who had denied the charges, were formally found not guilty. The case had been a point of diplomatic tension, with Beijing previously calling the allegations "malicious slander" and a "self-staged political farce."</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of adult film star Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its policies on nudity inconsistently and without clear justification, as other accounts with similar content remained active. In a significant decision, the court ordered Meta to review and adjust its terms of use to provide users with clearer mechanisms for challenging content moderation decisions. Gomez had argued the account closure affected her ability to work.</p>
