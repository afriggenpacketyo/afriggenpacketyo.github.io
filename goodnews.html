          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 362nd career home run, moving him into fourth place on the franchise's all-time leaderboard, ahead of the legendary Joe DiMaggio. This historic achievement came shortly after Judge met with President Donald Trump, who was in attendance for a previous game where Judge hit two homers. Judge's recent performance has been exceptional, with three home runs in the two games since the meeting. The article notes that only Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, and Lou Gehrig have hit more home runs for the storied baseball franchise.</p>

          <p>This autumn presents several opportunities for sky-gazers to witness notable celestial events as the nights grow longer after the equinox on September 22nd. Key highlights include Saturn reaching its opposition on September 21st, making it appear at its largest and brightest for the year and remaining visible for months. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November. The shower is expected to peak around October 22nd, with ideal viewing conditions due to the coinciding new moon, which will minimize light pollution.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns, all in their 80s, have fled the care home where they were placed and returned to their former convent, Kloster Goldenstein, just outside Salzburg. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns of their community, stated they were moved against their will in late 2023. With assistance from former students and a locksmith, they regained access to the historic building where they had spent most of their lives. Despite the lack of full utilities and disapproval from church authorities, the nuns are determined to live out their days in their spiritual home.</p>

          <p>In a heartwarming story from Cincinnati, Ohio, a bride named Shacole Fox was walked down the aisle by her 79-year-old landlord, Gil Pulliam. Fox, who never knew her father, was struggling with the painful void as her wedding day approached. Pulliam, from whom Fox rents a studio space for her makeup business, sensed her situation and offered to escort her. Fox emotionally recounted the moment, describing how Pulliam's gesture felt like it healed a wound in her heart. The unconventional processional created a powerful bond, with Fox saying she gained not only a husband but also a father figure on her wedding day.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his tenure as the Music and Artistic Director Designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's fall season. His first program featured works with strong connections to New York, including Bartók's Piano Concerto No. 3 and Charles Ives' Symphony No. 2, both of which had premieres or compositions linked to the city. The concert also included a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, reflecting Dudamel's tradition of introducing new music. His arrival has generated significant excitement, with hopes that he can reinvigorate the orchestra's prominence in a way not seen since the era of Leonard Bernstein.</p>

          <p>As a new academic year begins, current university students are sharing insights and advice for incoming freshers to help ease their transition into higher education. Tips range from practical matters like doing the dishes to avoid flatmate conflicts, to broader guidance on mental health and social life. Students emphasize that everyone feels nervous initially and that it is important not to place too much pressure on the first week. They also recommend joining societies to find like-minded friends and encourage new students, especially those who are younger or commuting, not to be afraid to ask for help when needed.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," revisits the iconic mock-rock band 40 years after the original film, but struggles to justify its existence. While seeing the original cast reunite offers some nostalgic charm, the film's premise of the band being revered by real-life music legends like Paul McCartney saps the satirical edge that made the first movie a classic. The review suggests that many of the gags, such as the recurring problem of exploding drummers, feel like tired encores rather than fresh comedic insights. Ultimately, the sequel is seen as a pleasant but unnecessary nostalgia trip that doesn't live up to its legendary predecessor.</p>

The investment is set to triple the plant's production and increase its workforce by 50%.

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of housing legislation designed to override local zoning laws and permit denser residential construction near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, allows for buildings up to nine stories tall directly adjacent to major transit stops, with scaled-down heights permitted further away. Proponents argue the measure is a crucial step to address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend that it is a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local communities of their planning authority.</p>
