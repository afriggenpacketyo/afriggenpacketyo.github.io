          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 21:20:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The coastal rail line connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume service on June 7 after undergoing nearly six weeks of reinforcement work to mitigate landslide and coastal erosion risks. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction last month to stabilize the rail line, which serves both Metrolink commuter trains and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner. Crews have placed thousands of tons of boulders along the rail line to absorb water flow and stabilize potential runoff, and are preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail. The Orange County Transportation Authority estimates the total cost of these projects at approximately $300 million, acknowledging the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition at a hospital after undergoing a craniotomy following his IBF minimumweight title match, according to his gym. Shigeoka, a former world champion, lost a split decision to Pedro Taduran and suffered a right subdural hematoma. Although he was not knocked down during the bout, Shigeoka lost consciousness after the final bell and was rushed to the hospital. Japan Boxing Commission rules prohibit a boxer who has had a craniotomy from holding a professional license, meaning Shigeoka will have to retire from the sport.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he and U.S. President Donald Trump deepened their understanding of each other's positions on tariffs and agreed to accelerate negotiations. A U.S. appeals court allowed Trump's administration to continue with its tariffs for now, while Japan's April jobless rate remained unchanged at 2.5%.

This reassessment is driven by geopolitical tensions and the attractive valuations of Chinese and Hong Kong stocks compared to expensive US stocks. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, and the firm believes diversifying away from US equities is becoming more compelling. Washington and Beijing's agreement to reduce most tariffs has also eased some geopolitical risk, potentially increasing investor interest in Chinese markets (not investment advice).</p>
