          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, the number of living survivors, known as "hibakusha," is rapidly declining, with their average age now over 86. To ensure their firsthand accounts of the nuclear attacks are not lost, a new generation is stepping forward to share these stories. The article highlights the work of individuals like 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who guides tourists in Hiroshima to convey the horrors of the event and promote a message of peace.</p>

          <p>A medium-security state prison in Norco, California, is scheduled to close by the fall of 2026, a decision driven by the state's declining inmate population and a desire for cost savings. The closure is expected to save California $150 million annually and reflects a broader trend of criminal justice reforms. Local officials in Norco are hopeful that the property, which was originally a luxury resort before becoming a prison, can be redeveloped to boost the local economy.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among influential economists in China over whether the government should include measurable consumption targets in its upcoming five-year plan. Proponents suggest that setting a formal goal for the household consumption rate, which is currently low, could help rebalance the nation's economy and improve living standards. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that such metrics are not practical to implement as official policy goals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds originally designated for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration's termination of the BRIC program was unlawful. The judge stated that repurposing the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters like floods.</p>

          <p>After being stalled for 17 years, work on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is now making significant progress. The project, awarded in 2008, was delayed by security challenges and the presence of ancient archaeological ruins. The company now says extraction could begin this year, after the Taliban government reportedly agreed to a more expensive underground mining technique to preserve the historical site.</p>

          <p>The FBI's annual Unified Crime Report for 2024 revealed a significant decrease in crime across the United States, with rates for murder, violent crime, and property crime all falling. This continues a downward trend from a spike that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. While experts view the data as highly positive for public safety, they also note that aggravated assault rates remain above pre-pandemic levels and that many crimes are never reported to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In a major strategic partnership, the National Football League is acquiring a 10% equity stake in ESPN. As part of the deal, Disney-owned ESPN will take over the NFL's media assets, including the NFL Network and the popular RedZone channel. This landmark agreement solidifies the relationship between the sports media giant and America's most popular sports league, and it comes as ESPN prepares to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p>

          <h2>NFL Takes 10% Stake in ESPN, Which Will Take Over the NFL Network</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 20:22:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has reached a deal to take a 10% ownership stake in the Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN, a move expected to solidify the sports media outlet’s relationship with the league for years to come.\n\nDisney and the NFL announced the blockbuster arrangement Tuesday night.\n\nIn return for the equity stake worth more than $2 billion based on recent valuations of the network, ESPN will take over the NFL’s cable properties including the NFL Network. Disney will distribute RedZone, the popular channel that continuously updates fans on the slate of Sunday contests.\n\nThe NFL Network also has the rights to seven regular season games — giving ESPN a larger slice of television’s top ratings draw.\n\nThe arrangement comes two years after Disney began evaluating options to maximize ESPN amid the fast-changing television landscape. The Burbank giant did not have to look much further than its most dominant programming partner.\n\nIn addition to the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN are also entering into a second non-binding agreement, under which the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property to be used by NFL Network and other assets. ESPN now owns the RedZone trademark and can use it for other sports.\n\nThe deal is a big win for ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, who took over the Disney unit in 2018 with a mandate to improve the company’s relationship with the NFL.\n\nThe equity stake comes ahead of ESPN’s move into the direct-to-consumer streaming business this fall, which gives consumers the opportunity to purchase the company’s sports channels without a cable or satellite TV subscription. NFL Network will also be available on the streaming service.\n\n“This is an exciting day for sports fans,” Pitaro said Tuesday in a statement. “By combining these NFL media assets with ESPN’s reach and innovation, we’re creating a premier destination for football fans. Together, ESPN and the NFL are redefining how fans engage with the game — anytime, anywhere. This deal helps fuel ESPN’s digital future, laying the foundation for an even more robust offering as we prepare to launch our new direct-to-consumer service.”\n\nThe new product is aimed at recapturing sports fans who are forgoing cable and satellite services. ESPN has seen its reach in cable decline from 98 million homes in 2013 to around 72 million as a result of cord-cutting.\n\n“Today’s announcement paves the way for the world’s leading sports media brand and America’s most popular sport to deliver an even more compelling experience for NFL fans, in a way that only ESPN and Disney can,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.\n\nESPN has the broadcast rights to “Monday Night Football” and two Super Bowl games in the current NFL contract that runs through 2033 but is expected to be reopened in 2029.\n\nThe NFL also recognized that millions of consumers no longer pay for cable channel bundles, which has cut into the distribution of the NFL Network. The deal with ESPN will provide the league with another potent conduit to reach its fans.\n\n“Since its launch in 2003, NFL Network has provided millions of fans unprecedented access to the sport they love,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “The Network’s sale to ESPN will build on this remarkable legacy, providing more NFL football for more fans in new and innovative ways.”\n\nThe deal with Disney means the NFL’s other partners — Fox, NBC, CBS, YouTube and Amazon — will be bidding against an entity that the league has a financial interest in the next time that media rights come up.\n\nLachlan Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox Corp., told Wall Street analysts Tuesday he is not concerned the NFL’s partnership with ESPN will impact his network’s standing with the league.\n\n“We have a tremendous relationship with the NFL,” Murdoch said. “We appreciate that they are fans of the broadcast and cable networks, and we look forward to working with them and deepening our relationship with them as we move forward.”</p>

          <p>U.S. border officials have been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, according to Department of Homeland Security sources. The directive follows a federal appeals court ruling which found that the policy could not be used to completely suspend other humanitarian protections under U.S. law. This decision effectively reopens pathways for migrants to request asylum and other forms of protection, a right that the administration's policy had largely eliminated.</p>
