        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda Motor Co. reported a 76% plunge in operating profit for its fourth quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations due to the anticipated impact of U.S. tariffs. While the motorcycle business saw record sales, the automobile sector experienced a decline, particularly in China and Southeast Asia. Hybrid electric vehicle sales in North America showed growth due to increased EV incentives. The company has downgraded its financial outlook for the current fiscal year, projecting a nearly 59% drop in operating profit, citing the significant impact of global tariff policies and the difficulty in forecasting due to frequent revisions.

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been debated. The legislation requires that two doctors assess the patient's mental fitness to make the decision, and would raise the minimum age from 16 to 18. Supporters argue it's a progressive move to ease suffering, while opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The vote is expected to be tight, with MSPs allowed a free vote, and the Scottish government remaining neutral on the matter.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report is expected to show the initial effects of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements on U.S. prices. Economists anticipate a slight cooldown in inflation, despite earlier fears of a price surge due to tariffs. Trump has since paused and slashed some tariffs, including those on China, which is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that sustained tariff increases could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of an executive order to lower prescription drug prices, attention is drawn to the most expensive medications in the U.S., both by price and sales volume.

          <p>Financial technology firms, which initially benefited from interest rate hikes, now face a resilience test as interest rates decline. While higher rates boosted net interest income for fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo in 2024, a broad decline in rates raises doubts about the sustainability of this income. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. The impact of falling interest rates will test the adaptability and durability of fintech business models.</p>
