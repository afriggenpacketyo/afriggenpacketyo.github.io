          <h2>Florida Gulf Coast Residents Face Hurdles in Hurricane Recovery</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Months after Hurricanes Helene and Milton struck Florida's Gulf Coast, residents in Pinellas County are struggling with recovery due to bureaucratic delays involving FEMA, insurance companies, and local governments, leaving homeowners in limbo and slowing down reconstruction efforts. Public adjusters report stalled cases due to insurance delays and contractor shortages, while conflicting instructions from townships further complicate the process. Despite these challenges, some businesses like Hubbard's Marina have managed to bounce back quickly, emphasizing the importance of tourism for economic recovery. The new hurricane season brings heightened anxiety, but local leaders stress that the area is open for visitors and that tourism is crucial for the region's financial revival.</p>

          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, is advocating for Japan to abolish the death penalty, despite strong public support for it in Japan. Elbegdorj, who successfully terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017, suggests that the Japanese government should disclose more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy, which respects human rights and the sanctity of life, and cites the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj notes that violent crimes decreased in Mongolia after the death penalty was abolished, and he encourages Japanese lawmakers to exercise leadership on this issue.</p>

          <p>Senior negotiators from the U.S. and China have agreed on a framework to advance trade talks following previous disputes, as announced by representatives from both sides. This agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus, which includes a 90-day suspension of tariffs imposed earlier this year. The framework was reached after two days of talks in London, and now requires approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Disputes over semiconductors, visas, and rare earth minerals had previously threatened the fragile truce, but this new framework signals a commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue between the two countries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company's robotaxi service is "tentatively" scheduled to launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with the first driverless trip planned for June 28. Musk emphasized that safety is a top priority, and the date could be subject to change. The initial rollout will involve a small number of Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest "unsupervised" version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, with geofencing and remote monitoring. While supporters are enthusiastic, concerns about safety and Musk's political activities have prompted planned protests, highlighting the contentious nature of Tesla's autonomous driving technology.</p>

She will face Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the November general election, aiming to secure a third consecutive term for the Democrats. Sherrill's campaign focused on her personal story and making the state more affordable, while shying away from offering a broad-based plan. A victory in November would make her the second female governor of New Jersey, succeeding current Governor Phil Murphy, who is term-limited.</p>

          <p>China's J-20 stealth fighter has reportedly tripled its radar detection range due to advancements in silicon-carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology led by scientist Xu Xiangang at Shandong University. The university claims that Xu's team's SiC material has enabled a threefold increase in the detection range of phased array radar systems, giving Chinese radars a first-mover advantage. The technology is considered crucial for national security, enhancing the range of Chinese radars, improving missile accuracy, and boosting the power of laser weapons. The J-20, known as the Mighty Dragon, is viewed as China's answer to America's F-22 Raptor.</p>
