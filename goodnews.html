          <p>Central banks worldwide have been consistently increasing their gold reserves, a trend that continues even as the metal's price reaches new highs. Experts explain this strategy is driven by a desire to diversify away from reliance on single currencies like the U.S. dollar and to hedge against inflation. Gold is valued as a stable store of value with no counterparty risk, providing financial security and liquidity during times of geopolitical tension or economic crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, homeowners with high mortgage rates are exploring refinancing options. While experts traditionally recommend refinancing for a full percentage point reduction, the current market may justify it for even a half-point difference. Average 30-year refinance rates are now around 6.51%, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or buying mortgage points could secure even lower rates for homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments.

          <p>Shares of Applied Digital surged 16% after the company reported first-quarter revenue that significantly exceeded expectations, driven by high demand for its artificial intelligence data centers. The company's revenue of $64.2 million was up 84% from the previous year, reflecting its success in securing large-scale lease agreements. This strong performance highlights the "picks and shovels" role data center providers are playing in the current AI boom, positioning the company for continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A professional golfer from Florida, despite his successful career, revealed on "The Ramsey Show" that he is struggling with approximately $300,000 in debt. The debt accumulated from $220,000 in student loans for his MBA and an $80,000 IRS bill, compounded by an agent who allegedly stole $250,000 of his earnings. Financial hosts advised him to create a new income stream, such as coaching, and to focus on his motivation for becoming debt-free to overcome his financial challenges.</p>

          <p>An examination of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas reveals that its text is vague and open to interpretation, which may be intentional. The document, titled as a step toward a "comprehensive end" to the war, appears to declare the conflict over but lacks specific details on key issues like Hamas's disarmament or the full extent of an Israeli withdrawal. This ambiguity leaves room for future disagreements and does not explicitly rule out a resumption of hostilities if negotiations on subsequent phases of the peace plan stall.</p>
