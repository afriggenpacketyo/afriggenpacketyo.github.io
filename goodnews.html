          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the smaller Japan Innovation Party have reportedly forged a new alliance, paving the way for Sanae Takaichi to become the nation's first female Prime Minister. Takaichi, who assumed the LDP's leadership earlier this month, faced political uncertainty after her prior ruling coalition disintegrated. Under the new agreement, Ishin lawmakers will support Takaichi in Tuesday's parliamentary election, although the party does not plan to initially appoint ministers to her cabinet. This significant political realignment marks a potential historic milestone for Japan, ending a period of fragmentation and setting the stage for a new era of governance.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators gathered in cities across the United States and worldwide for "No Kings" protests, voicing anger over President Trump's policies, including his administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants and deployment of National Guard troops. The rallies, described by some as "street parties" with marching bands and inflatable costumes, saw participants carrying signs with anti-fascist and anti-authoritarian slogans. While largely peaceful, some tensions arose, particularly in Portland. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, dismissed the events as "Hate America" rallies, but organizers emphasized a "fierce love for our country" as the driving force behind the widespread demonstrations.</p>

          <p>UCLA secured a hard-fought 20-17 comeback victory over Maryland, extending their midseason resurgence to three consecutive wins. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava, despite sustaining an apparent knee injury and committing three turnovers, found his rhythm when it mattered most, engineering a late-game drive. A 35-yard run by Anthony Frias II set up the winning 23-yard field goal with seconds left. The Bruins' stout defense, which largely contained Maryland's offense, also made crucial stops throughout the game, culminating in a dramatic win that puts UCLA in a national spotlight next weekend.</p>

          <h2>China's AMIES Technology Aims to Reduce Reliance on Foreign Chipmaking Equipment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 22:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is emerging as a key player in China's efforts to reduce its dependence on Dutch giant ASML for chipmaking machines. Advanced lithography remains a critical bottleneck for China, exacerbated by US export controls restricting access to top-tier deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems. As a spin-off from state-owned SMEE, AMIES focuses on commercializing equipment more rapidly, though SMEE's current production-grade tools lag significantly behind global leaders. This initiative represents China's strategic drive to achieve self-sufficiency in crucial semiconductor technology.</p>
