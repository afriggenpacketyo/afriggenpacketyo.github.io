          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," serves as a follow-up to her breakout success and focuses on her continued frustrations with her love life despite her fame. The album features a gallery of disappointing men, set to a sound that blends '70s AM-radio pop with modern touches of country and dance music. While some lyrics are seen as reaching for meme-worthy status, standout tracks showcase her sharp songwriting and versatile vocal performance. The album critiques a social power structure where even a successful woman contends with a lackluster dating pool, lampooning patriarchal norms with a satirical edge.</p>

          <p>Despite securing a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley with a stoppage-time penalty, Manchester United's performance highlighted significant and ongoing issues with their goalkeepers. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged that his team is in a moment where any shot near their box feels like a potential goal, following costly errors from goalkeepers in recent matches. In this game, Altay Bayindir's failure to handle a shot allowed Burnley to equalize at 2-2, underscoring the team's defensive fragility. The win provides temporary relief but fails to mask the urgent need for stability in the crucial goalkeeping position.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among pediatric and psychological experts suggests that limiting screen time is crucial for healthy childhood development. For the youngest children, a "screen-free until three" approach is recommended to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, excessive screen time can replace vital activities like motor skill development, social interaction, and imaginative play. While acknowledging the role of digital interaction in modern life, experts advise parents to supervise content, set clear rules, and prioritize real-world experiences to foster crucial life skills.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who has been instrumental for the team since joining on loan from Manchester City. Grealish provided two assists in Everton's 3-2 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers, repeating his feat from the previous weekend and earning man-of-the-match honors. Moyes praised Grealish's creativity and presence, suggesting the player is thriving with more game time and a need to prove himself after being sidelined at his parent club. The playmaker's resurgent form has reignited discussions about his potential return to the England national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

After selling Barstool Sports to Penn Entertainment and then buying it back for $1, Portnoy has continued to build his media empire, securing a content deal with Fox Sports.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. A UK-based study involving over 200 GP surgeries showed that the device, which analyzes subtle heart sounds undetectable by the human ear and records an ECG, significantly improved detection rates. Patients with heart failure were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed within a year using the AI tool. This innovation is being hailed as a potential "game-changer" that could lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes for patients.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:34:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, presents a more polished and emotionally anchored version of the Troma classic. Starring Peter Dinklage as a janitor who transforms into a mutant vigilante after being exposed to toxic waste, this iteration retains the gore and goofy parody of the original but with higher production values. The story pits the hero, Toxie, against a villainous pharmaceutical corporation run by a CEO played by Kevin Bacon. While diverting, the film's well-made nature creates a disconnect from the intentionally cheap, offensive style that defined the original cult hit.</p>
