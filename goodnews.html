          <p>President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. Following their discussions, Trump announced that "great progress" had been made and multiple points were agreed upon, but he clarified that no definitive ceasefire deal had been reached. Putin expressed optimism, stating there is "every reason to believe" the conflict could be resolved. The two leaders did not take questions from the press, concluding their joint appearance with a handshake before departing the stage separately after their lengthy meeting.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and her discussion of her fondness for the color orange on a podcast, numerous major brands have launched orange-themed marketing campaigns. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix and even the social media platform X have adopted orange hues in their branding to align with the cultural moment. This phenomenon highlights Swift's significant economic influence, as her previous Eras Tour generated substantial revenue for the cities it visited. The rapid corporate response underscores the immense value brands see in associating with her powerful and engaged fanbase.</p>

          <p>Yavar Abbas, a 104-year-old World War II veteran, gained attention after moving King Charles III to tears with an unscripted tribute during the VJ Day commemoration. This article delves into his extraordinary life, from joining the British Indian Army to fight fascism to serving as a combat cameraman on the front lines in Burma. Abbas filmed pivotal battles like Kohima and Mandalay, narrowly escaping death multiple times. Reflecting on his experiences, including witnessing the devastation in Hiroshima, he now views war as a crime and expresses profound disappointment that humanity has not learned from the past.</p>

          <p>Iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the relaunch of standalone physical stores, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, is hosting its first catwalk show in seven years to signal its return. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials, Topshop will face challenges in attracting a new generation of shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants like Shein. The company's success will depend on its ability to recapture its unique "cool" factor and balance its price point in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a dramatic Premier League season opener at Anfield, marked by emotional tributes and standout performances. New £70 million signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another, quickly becoming a fan favorite. Despite the victory, Liverpool's defense showed signs of vulnerability, allowing Bournemouth to equalize at 2-2 before late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah sealed the win. The match highlighted both the promise of Liverpool's new offensive talent and the defensive issues the reigning champions must address early in the season.</p>

Wall Street executives from the NYSE and Nasdaq report a healthy pipeline of companies preparing to go public in the second half of the year. While the activity is welcomed, some experts caution that the market could be overheating, drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to walk back the federal takeover of the city's police force. The deal came after D.C. sued the administration, arguing the move was an illegal overreach of power. Under the agreement, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command of the Metropolitan Police Department, not a federally appointed chief as the Justice Department had ordered. The administration also agreed to rewrite a directive that had aimed to force D.C. police to cooperate more fully with federal immigration authorities, a key point of contention.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, plans to sell a simple, customizable, American-made EV pickup truck for around half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones, two-seat base model that owners can then modify with over 100 available accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. With federal EV tax credits set to expire, the company faces the challenge of keeping its price point competitive, as the truck's cost may rise from a projected sub-$20,000 to nearly $28,000, placing it against established competitors.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to terminate President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The lawmakers argue that the president's action is an abuse of power under the D.C. Home Rule Act, which allows for temporary federal control only under "special conditions of an emergency" that they claim do not exist. The resolution asserts that Trump manufactured a crisis by pushing a misleading narrative about crime rates in the city. The move represents a legislative effort to restore local control and push back against what they call a "lawless" takeover.</p>
