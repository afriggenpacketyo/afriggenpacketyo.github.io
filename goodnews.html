          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit claims these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, arguing that the federal government has preeminent authority over immigration matters. The DOJ contends that Colorado's policies allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to gain control of an apartment complex in Aurora. The lawsuit names Governor Jared Polis, the state Legislature, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser as defendants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>First Roses Were Likely Yellow, Chinese and Dutch Study Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the popular association of roses with red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to trace the flower's origins. Ancestral trait reconstruction indicated that the common ancestor of Rosa most likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. This research sheds light on the evolutionary history of one of the world's most cultivated ornamental flowers.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in key technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence. They highlight China's success in disseminating, commercializing, and manufacturing tech, citing examples like DeepSeek's AI models and the popularity of Chinese apps. The authors warn that the US must openly share more of its AI technologies and research, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge. They suggest that Chinese tech has become better despite constraints, and the online response in China to American tariffs has been nationalistic and surprisingly optimistic.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that visitors to Japan find the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations, to be the biggest inconvenience during their trip. The issue was cited by 21.9 percent of over 4,000 foreign visitors as their top concern. While the figure improved from the previous year, many respondents reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks.
