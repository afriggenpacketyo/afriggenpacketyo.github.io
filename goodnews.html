          <p>Walmart heiress Christy Walton funded a full-page advertisement in the New York Times promoting the 'No Kings' protest against President Trump, scheduled for the same day as the Army's 250th Anniversary parade. The ad lists declarations honoring commitments to allies, defending against dictators, and supporting a healthy economy, emphasizing that the government is 'of the people, by the people, for the people.' Walmart distanced itself from the ad, stating that Ms. Walton does not serve on the board or play any role in decision-making. The protests are positioned as a response to the 'increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration.' The protests aim to reduce attention on the military parade, highlighting concerns about the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A widespread technology outage impacted several major online platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Google, OpenAI, and Spotify, causing disruptions for tens of thousands of users. Cloudflare, a company providing services to many impacted platforms, reported intermittent failures and initiated an investigation. Google Cloud later identified itself as the source of the outage and worked to restore services, with most platforms recovering by late afternoon. The outage affected various services, including Discord, Google Meet, Snapchat, Gmail, YouTube, and many others, highlighting the interconnectedness of the internet and the potential for significant disruptions. The quick recovery of services is a testament to the resilience of the internet's infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has seemingly reversed his stance on Chinese students studying in the United States, stating his support for them and pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized the benefits of Chinese students for American schools and the country, advocating for their employment by American companies. His remarks suggest a shift towards a more welcoming approach to international students, emphasizing their potential contributions to the US economy and innovation. The comments are a welcome sign for international exchange.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has dismissed reports of Ferrari considering replacing team principal Frederic Vasseur, describing them as 'nonsense' and expressing his full support for Vasseur. Hamilton emphasized the time it takes to integrate new personnel and the potential impact of changes on the team's performance. Vasseur joined Ferrari in 2023 and is aiming to lead the team to its first constructors' title since 2008, however, the team has faced challenges this season. Hamilton, who recently joined Ferrari, affirmed his commitment to winning with Vasseur and highlighted the ongoing efforts to improve the car's performance.</p>
