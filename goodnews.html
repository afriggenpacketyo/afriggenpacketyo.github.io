          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to be the next NASA administrator, citing the need for complete alignment with President Trump's "America First" agenda. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4, has a long history with Elon Musk and SpaceX, which raised concerns during his confirmation hearing. While Isaacman stated he would prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars, he clarified that a lunar landing would take precedence. Huston did not give a reason as to why the White House was withdrawing its nomination.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper in a shocking twist during the series finale of Doctor Who. The BBC confirmed Piper's return but kept the details of her character's role a secret, leaving fans to speculate about her involvement in the show's future. Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler, expressed her excitement about returning to the Whoniverse, and showrunner Russell T Davies hinted at the significance of her return. Gatwa expressed gratitude for his time as the Doctor and thanked fans for their support.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, with the match notably disrupted by fireworks from a nearby Champions League final celebration. Norrie, ranked 81st, used his experience to overcome the debutant Fearnley in straight sets, despite the distractions. Norrie expressed difficulty managing the random timing of the fireworks, while Fearnley downplayed the noise as a factor in his loss. With Jack Draper also advancing, it marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the last 16 of the French Open.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number, but later corrected the figure with the help of a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area, and beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate the queen. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the rescue operation, and by morning, most bees were expected to return to their hives.</p>

          <h2>Medicare Enrollment Delay: What to Consider</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life, but exceptions exist for individuals covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan. If you or your spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can generally opt to keep the employer-provided insurance and delay applying for Medicare without penalty. Delaying enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which are no longer permitted once enrolled in Medicare. It is wise to consult with the employer's benefits department to confirm appropriate coverage and eligibility for delayed application. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility in Formula 1, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test to limit aerodynamic exploitation, but Hamilton claims it has changed nothing. He stated that wings still bend, and teams had to spend more money on new designs. Hamilton suggested the money could have been better spent on charitable causes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the use of corporate buzzwords and their impact on workplace communication and trust. While buzzwords are intended to convey meaning efficiently, studies show they can impede trust and create feelings of insecurity among employees. The article suggests that buzzwords may be used to distract from the primary goal of making money and encourages the use of plain language instead. Using metaphors can be helpful, but clear communication is key to building trust and understanding in the workplace.</p>
