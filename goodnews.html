          <p>A colossal interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has been identified as significantly larger and more massive than initially estimated, weighing over 33 billion tons and spanning at least 3.1 miles. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb posits that the object's observed non-gravitational acceleration could indicate it is an artifact of alien technology, rather than a purely natural celestial body. As this third-ever detected interstellar visitor heads towards the Sun and passes near Mars, Jupiter, and Venus, Loeb advocates for NASA to utilize the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for detailed observation, hoping even a single pixel could refine understanding of its true dimensions.</p>

Following a severe boat accident that resulted in the amputation of her right foot, Reid, a world champion long jumper, found herself forced to buy pairs of expensive shoes, wasting money on the unused item. Her campaign emphasizes the financial burden and the need for inclusivity beyond just marketing imagery, benefiting amputees and individuals with differing foot sizes.

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a massive £5.5 billion ($7.4 billion) bitcoin scam, marking what is believed to be the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scheme that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China, subsequently attempting to launder the illicit funds through property purchases in the UK. This conviction culminates a seven-year international investigation involving multiple jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies. Efforts are now underway by the Crown Prosecution Service to recover and return the stolen assets to the victims.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the international gold-mining subsidiary of China's partially state-owned Zijin Mining, experienced a strong market entry in Hong Kong, with its shares surging over 60% on debut. The company's initial public offering successfully raised nearly 25 billion Hong Kong dollars, approximately $3.2 billion, making it the world's second-largest IPO this year. This significant listing coincides with gold prices reaching record highs, fueled by robust safe-haven demand, expectations of interest rate cuts, and prevailing global economic uncertainty. The event underscores a notable resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, attracting major investors like Singapore's GIC and BlackRock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article proposes that Hong Kong should serve as the United Nations' Asia headquarters, arguing this would not only aid the organization's reform efforts but also strengthen Beijing's vision for global governance. The article points out the current deficit of a major UN hub in Asia, despite the continent housing approximately 60% of the global population. Hong Kong's unique attributes, such as its common law system, English as an official language, and highly competitive corporate taxes, are cited as making it an ideal candidate. This strategic positioning could significantly deepen China's engagement with the UN, to which it is the second-largest financial contributor.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's long-anticipated Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is nearing inauguration, poised to significantly alleviate congestion at the city's current overworked facility and bolster India's aviation ambitions. The sprawling new airport, featuring two parallel runways, aims to handle 90 million passengers annually and is connected to the city by India's longest sea-bridge. However, it faces substantial challenges, including its considerable distance from Mumbai's commercial center and the lack of immediate last-mile metro connectivity. Experts also point to existing regulatory hurdles that could impede its goal of becoming a seamless international transfer hub, akin to Singapore or Dubai.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rican global music sensation Bad Bunny has been announced as the headliner for Super Bowl LX's halftime show, a decision anticipated to ignite strong reactions from conservative critics. The article highlights how right-wing commentators are already interpreting this choice as further evidence of "woke culture" permeating American institutions, citing Bad Bunny's predominantly Spanish-language music and past political stances. Despite such criticism, the article posits that the NFL consistently selects highly popular artists, and Bad Bunny is currently Spotify's most-streamed male artist. His performance is framed as a cultural touchstone for his fans and heritage.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has launched a new action plan aimed at restructuring its strategic non-ferrous metals sector, projecting a reduced output growth of 1.5% for primary metals this year, down from 4.3% previously. The initiative shifts focus from sheer production volume to optimizing industrial structure, targeting an average annual growth of approximately 5% in value-added output. This comprehensive plan also prioritizes advanced exploration of critical metals like copper, aluminum, and lithium, alongside boosting the recycling of used batteries and solar panels. The measures are designed to combat intense competition and bolster hi-tech industries. (not investment advice)</p>

McConaughey explained that he felt compelled to have only brief conversations with her to prevent his personal life from appearing in news outlets. The actor has since reconciled, allowing her to freely share stories, and they are now co-starring in an upcoming film, signifying a mended relationship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is reportedly investigating the development of stealthy flying-wing aircraft designed as "arsenal planes" capable of carrying dozens of air-to-air missiles. This strategic concept is being re-examined for potential high-intensity conflicts, particularly with China in the Indo-Pacific region. These platforms would augment the "magazine depth" of crewed fighters like the F-22 and F-35, enabling them to launch long-range missiles from standoff distances. While an air-to-air variant of the B-21 Raider was previously considered, concerns about production capacity mean other platforms are also under consideration. This initiative aims to provide affordable mass against numerically superior adversaries.</p>
