          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials concluded a day of tariff negotiations in Switzerland, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset" in a social media post. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in discussions aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, though specific details remain undisclosed. While Trump expressed openness to lowering tariffs, Chinese officials insist on the U.S. dropping its tariffs first. The talks are taking place against a backdrop of slowing goods flow and significant economic impact from the existing tariffs, with both sides acknowledging the unsustainable nature of the current situation.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to resume trade negotiations, aiming to de-escalate tensions impacting the global economy. The meetings, the first since increased tariffs, seek to address trade imbalances and concerns over fentanyl exports from China. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that both sides are engaging in talks has raised hopes for a potential reduction in tariffs and a tempering of hostile rhetoric. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that a prolonged trade war could lead to slower growth and higher prices worldwide.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston, a 24-year-old woman found strangled in her car, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her death. The case was cracked after a thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the victim's car matched Sims in the FBI database, thanks to an upgraded fingerprint search algorithm. Sims, who was an Army private stationed nearby in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder. Ralston's son expressed gratitude for the renewed investigation that finally brought closure.</p>

China accounts for less than 40% of Mattel's worldwide toy production, providing flexibility in navigating the tariff situation. CEO Ynon Kreiz noted that Mattel sources products from business partners in seven countries, further reducing its reliance on any single nation.</p>

The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, but it is expected to change significantly before the final vote. With Republican control of Congress, the package can pass without Democratic support, but the narrow majority in the House and the need to fit within a limited budget framework could make the process difficult.

          <p>Southern California's recent heat wave is expected to end Saturday evening, with cooler temperatures forecast for Mother's Day. After record highs, temperatures are predicted to drop by about 5 degrees on Sunday, with coastal areas experiencing highs in the 60s to mid-70s. The return of fog and breezes is anticipated, with the possibility of drizzles and light rain early next week. The rapid shift marks a return to more typical May weather conditions after a brief period of extreme heat.</p>
