          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are making strides with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), targeted medicines that deliver chemotherapy agents directly to cancer cells. ADCs have the potential to replace chemotherapy in some cases by minimizing harm to healthy cells. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing these drugs, with the ADC market projected to reach $31 billion by 2028. While challenges remain, including optimizing the release of chemotherapy and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins, progress is being made with next-generation ADCs and combination regimens. </p>
