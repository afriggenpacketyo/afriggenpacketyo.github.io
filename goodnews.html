          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 01:01:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing phenomenon of loose skin among individuals who have rapidly lost significant weight using injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro. While many celebrate the health benefits of their weight loss, they are often left feeling self-conscious about their appearance, comparing it to that of an elderly person. The high cost of body contouring surgery, which is rarely covered by the NHS and can cost tens of thousands privately, presents another significant hurdle for patients seeking to address this unwanted side effect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As schools resume, the ubiquitous parent WhatsApp group returns, serving as both a vital communication tool and a source of significant stress for many. While useful for reminders about school events and organizing teacher gifts, these chats are often plagued by high message volumes, competitive parenting, and divisive arguments. Some parents are choosing to leave the groups to avoid the anxiety and the unequal distribution of school-related administrative tasks, which typically fall on mothers. Experts advise setting clear boundaries to manage the constant notifications and potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson is currently in third place and remains in contention for a medal as she heads into the final two events of the world heptathlon in Tokyo. After recording a long jump of 6.42m, she stands 167 points behind the American leader, Anna Hall. Johnson-Thompson expressed some frustration over a narrowly fouled final long jump attempt that would have significantly improved her position. The competition will conclude with the javelin and 800m events, where the final podium positions will be decided in a tight contest.</p>

The Taipei Aerospace and Defence Technology Exhibition featured two key projects: the island's first locally developed anti-ballistic missile system, known as Chiang-Kong, and a cruise missile co-developed with a U.S. defense company. The Chiang-Kong system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles at altitudes up to 70km, significantly enhancing Taiwan's layered air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after nearly eight months of detention by the Taliban in Afghanistan and have had an emotional reunion with their daughter in Doha. The couple, who had lived and run a charity in the country for decades, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. Their release was secured through Qatari mediation, and their family expressed immense relief, noting the couple's deteriorating health during their harrowing imprisonment.</p>

          <p>The High Seas Treaty, a landmark global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters, is set to become international law after reaching the required 60 ratifications. The treaty, which will take effect in January, allows for the creation of marine protected areas in the high seas, which cover over two-thirds of the world's oceans. Environmental groups have hailed this as a monumental achievement, providing a crucial framework to help achieve the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030 and reversing damage from overfishing, pollution, and climate change.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has sentenced Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of a Wuhan-based chemical company, to 25 years in prison for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals and money laundering. Wang and his marketing manager were convicted for their roles in shipping hundreds of kilograms of the chemicals into the United States, often disguised as everyday goods. This case was the first time the U.S. has charged Chinese companies for trafficking the chemicals directly into the country, rather than to cartels in Mexico, marking a significant step in efforts to combat the fentanyl crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he and Chinese President Xi Jinping approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, though Beijing's confirmation was more ambiguous. The deal would reportedly involve selling TikTok's U.S. business to a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country. A key point of negotiation remains the ownership of the powerful algorithm that drives content for TikTok's 170 million American users. Some U.S. lawmakers remain concerned about potential continued influence from the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the U.S., many Chinese companies are increasingly turning their focus toward the fast-growing economies of Southeast Asia. A major trade fair in Nanning is serving as a key testing ground for these exporters to connect with regional buyers and expand their overseas footprint. Companies see immense potential in Southeast Asia's large, young consumer base, viewing the region as a crucial new frontier for growth. This strategic shift reflects a broader adaptation to changing global economic conditions and trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, ruling that the complaint was improperly formulated. The judge characterized the 85-page filing as full of political rhetoric and personal attacks rather than a clear legal argument, calling it an impermissible effort to attack political adversaries. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits of the case, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile a more professional and concise complaint that adheres to legal standards.</p>
