          <h2>Elevating Homes as a Solution to Increasing Flood Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 08:50:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate change is increasing flood risks, leading homeowners in coastal New Jersey to elevate their homes as a protective measure. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 served as a wake-up call, causing significant damage and prompting residents to invest in raising their houses. While effective, home elevation is expensive, costing upwards of $140,000, and requires financial assistance programs to be accessible. This approach alone won't fully protect communities; infrastructure like roads and utilities also need to be safeguarded, and there are questions about the future of FEMA funding for such projects. This article highlights the challenges and potential solutions for communities facing rising flood risks due to climate change. The optimism score is 55.</p>
