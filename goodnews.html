          <p>CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity software company, reported strong first-quarter earnings, exceeding expectations. However, the company's weaker-than-expected revenue forecast caused a 7% drop in its share price after hours.  The increase in costs, partly due to a software outage, and a less optimistic revenue projection for the next quarter contributed to investor concern. Despite this, CrowdStrike announced a $1 billion share buyback program.</p>
