          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform UK MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. Lowe had been suspended by the party in March following claims of threats towards the party's chairman. The CPS made the decision after a detailed review of evidence and witness statements, concluding there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. Lowe, now an independent MP, accused Reform of a smear campaign and attacked Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, in an effort to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves fully covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures. The government provides a lump-sum payment, but delivery costs often exceed that amount. Obstetricians have expressed concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility has impacted college savers, but experts advise against panicking and selling investments prematurely. Instead, they suggest assessing risk appetite and considering adjusting asset allocation, possibly de-risking a portion of the portfolio into cash equivalents. Families can also use income or savings outside the 529 plan to cover immediate college expenses and request reimbursement later. Despite concerns over college costs, college savings accounts remain vital, and recent changes allow for rolling over unused funds to a Roth IRA and using funds for continuing education and student loan payments.

          <p>Goldman Sachs President John Waldron stated that investors have recently trimmed their U.S. dollar holdings, returning to more neutral positions on the currency, rather than a wholesale exit. The move follows market volatility after the Trump administration's tariff policies. Waldron noted that investors had previously been optimistic about the U.S. outperforming the rest of the world, leading to overweight positions in U.S. assets. The recent truce in the U.S.-China trade war has since set off a relief rally in stocks and propelled the dollar higher. (not investment advice)</p>
