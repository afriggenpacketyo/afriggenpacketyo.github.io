        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A court in the Netherlands has ordered the confiscation of approximately $112 million in criminal assets from Jos Leijdekkers, a prominent drug lord known as "Chubby Jos." The assets were determined to be proceeds from extensive cocaine trafficking and gold purchases. Leijdekkers, who was sentenced in absentia to 24 years in prison, remains a fugitive and is on Europol's most-wanted list. Dutch authorities believe he is hiding in Sierra Leone, where he has allegedly formed connections with the country's political elite, complicating efforts to secure his arrest.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements increased dramatically in June, reaching their highest volume since late 2009. The data shows a 60% year-over-year increase, with analysts suggesting this could be a sign of a thaw in trade relations with the West. This surge follows reports that Beijing has been issuing six-month export licenses to certain American manufacturers. Additionally, China's Ministry of Commerce has indicated it will streamline export approval processes for European nations, signaling a potential relaxation of its tight controls on these critical minerals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, the UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters. This mutualization model, which has been discussed for over a decade, aims to rebuild trust and transform the organization's culture. The government stated it does not plan to reduce the current network of 11,500 branches. The consultation will also explore what future services the Post Office should offer, with a focus on banking, as traditional lenders continue to close high-street locations.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $123,000 as the U.S. House prepares for a "crypto week" focused on several pieces of related legislation. This rally makes Bitcoin the world's fifth most valuable asset class, with a market capitalization exceeding that of Amazon. The legislative push is supported by President Donald Trump, who has pivoted to a pro-crypto stance and whose family is increasingly involved in the industry. The renewed enthusiasm reflects growing institutional demand and the potential for a clearer regulatory framework in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Dismiss Trump's Threat to Revoke Rosie O'Donnell's US Citizenship</h2>

          <p>Legal experts have dismissed as unconstitutional a threat made by Donald Trump to revoke the US citizenship of actor Rosie O'Donnell. Trump's post on Truth Social followed years of public feuding with O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. Experts quickly cited the 14th Amendment, which establishes birthright citizenship and clarifies that a president has no authority to strip a native-born citizen of their status. While denaturalization is possible in cases of fraud during the naturalization process, it does not apply to individuals born in the United States, making the threat legally baseless.</p>

          <p>As gold trades near record highs, investment experts are analyzing the key factors that will influence its price for the remainder of 2025. The precious metal's value is expected to be driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation concerns, and strong consumer demand from both new and existing investors. While some analysts are confident that gold will maintain its value, they note that new economic risks would be necessary to push prices to new highs. The article also explores silver as a more accessible alternative for investors, though it comes with greater volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Jordan have unearthed the long-lost Byzantine settlement of Tharais, providing new insights into the history of Christianity in the Middle East. The discovery, led by a professor from Mutah University, was guided by the ancient Madaba Map mosaic. Excavations at the site near the village of El-Irāq revealed the remains of a basilica-style church, an olive oil press, and various artifacts. The findings are expected to enhance the understanding of the region's transition from Byzantine to Islamic control and its broader archaeological context.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old man who escaped from a prison near Lyon, France, by hiding in a large bag carried by a departing inmate has been recaptured. The inmate was arrested early Monday morning on the outskirts of Lyon following an extensive investigation. His accomplice, the inmate who was being released, has not yet been found. A prison administration official described the escape as an extremely rare event resulting from a series of serious dysfunctions, prompting an internal review into the security failures that allowed it to happen.</p>

A decade later, his company is on track to generate over $50 million in revenue this year and is sold in more than 8,000 retail locations across the US. Kirby identified a culinary gap at the local farmers market and built his business from the ground up, focusing on slow, deep growth rather than rapid expansion. He has maintained control by avoiding venture capital, allowing him to focus on profitability and his long-term goal of becoming the top brand in the category.</p>

          <p>In response to declining cognitive skills in children post-pandemic, some experts are advocating for the use of 'brain training' programs in schools to improve working memory and focus. A recent German study suggested a 12-hour program improved children's IQ and long-term academic outcomes. However, the broader research on such interventions is inconclusive, with many studies showing limited or no effect when tested in real-world classroom settings. Critics caution against replacing core curriculum time with these programs, arguing that foundational knowledge is more critical for developing skills like critical thinking.</p>

Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to signing the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (SEANWFZ) without reservation, and indicated Russia may do the same. The 1995 treaty aims to eliminate nuclear weapons from the region while allowing for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
