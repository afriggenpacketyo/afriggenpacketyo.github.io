          <p>China has completed the design for its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, known as the CFR-1000. The project, which now awaits final approval, is a significant step in the country's plan to develop more fuel-efficient and advanced nuclear power sources. This development places China alongside other major powers like the US and Russia, who are also pursuing next-generation reactor technology, with the new facility expected to be operational after 2030.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative effort to improve hurricane forecasting, researchers are fitting sharks with sensors to collect crucial ocean data. Led by the University of Delaware, the project turns sharks into mobile ocean sensors, gathering information on water temperature and conductivity, which influence hurricane strength. This method aims to provide more efficient and continuous data collection in the vast ocean compared to expensive and slower alternatives like robotic gliders, with the goal of feeding the data into hurricane computer models.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers showcased a revitalized offense in a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, marking their third victory in four games. After a difficult start to July, the team's bats have come alive, with key contributions from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a two-run homer, and Andy Pages. This positive offensive trend, with the team scoring at least five runs in seven of their last ten games, provides momentum as the MLB trade deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>California state regulators have made it clear that Tesla is not permitted to operate an autonomous robotaxi service for the public without a human driver. While CEO Elon Musk has teased an expansion of the service, the California Public Utilities Commission confirmed Tesla's current permits only allow it to run a private, human-driven car service. The company notified the state it plans to offer service to "friends and family," but this must comply with non-autonomous vehicle rules.</p>

          <p>Jorge Mas, the owner of Inter Miami, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for what he calls a "draconian" decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one match. The suspension is a direct consequence of the players skipping the MLS All-Star game, in accordance with a long-standing league policy. While the MLS commissioner defended enforcing the rule, he acknowledged it was a difficult decision and said the league would reevaluate the policy with players.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a noticeable increase in the populations of certain insects, including butterflies, ladybirds, and wasps. The boom is linked to the thriving of species like aphids, a key food source, in the warm, dry conditions. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain this year could harm wetland habitats and lead to lower numbers for some insect and amphibian species in the following year.</p>

          <p>A new article explores the validity of widely accepted health benchmarks, such as walking 10,000 steps a day, drinking eight glasses of water, and getting eight hours of sleep. Health experts suggest that while these targets are based on beneficial principles, they shouldn't be treated as rigid, all-or-nothing rules. The consensus is that it's better to view them as flexible guidelines, focusing on consistency and adapting them to fit one's individual lifestyle and needs rather than fixating on hitting a specific number.</p>
