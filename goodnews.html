          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 14:57:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage interest rates reaching an 11-month low and a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated, homebuyers are re-evaluating their options. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are presented as a potential tool for securing a lower initial rate compared to traditional 30-year fixed loans. The article suggests that an ARM could be advantageous by providing lower initial payments, offering time to gauge market trends, and protecting against short-term rate volatility. However, it also cautions that ARMs are not suitable for every buyer and emphasizes understanding the long-term risks before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 14:38:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve looking imminent, savers are considering how to best utilize certificates of deposit (CDs). The article explores the strategic differences between short-term and long-term CDs in the current economic climate. Short-term CDs currently offer higher rates and greater flexibility, allowing savers to pivot their strategy quickly. Conversely, long-term CDs provide an opportunity to lock in today's relatively high rates for an extended period, protecting against future rate decreases. The piece also suggests a "CD ladder" strategy as a way to balance flexibility with long-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a public outcry over a new logo that negatively impacted its stock value, Cracker Barrel is now suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants. The company announced that it heard customer feedback regarding both the logo and the store interiors, conceding that the planned modernizations did not align with the brand's beloved "Old Country Store" image. To date, only four of the chain's 660 locations have been remodeled, and no further changes will be made. The reversal is part of a broader effort by the company to refocus on its core identity amid slowing financial growth.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced a new policy requiring employees to work from an office three days per week, beginning in February for those near its Washington headquarters and expanding thereafter. The company is shifting from its more flexible pandemic-era policy that allowed many employees to work from home up to half the time. In a memo, HR chief Amy Coleman cited the need for the "energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side" to build new AI products. The company clarified that the policy update is about collaborative work culture and is not a measure to reduce headcount.</p>

          <p>Actor Oscar Nuñez is reprising his role as accountant Oscar Martinez from "The Office" in a new Peacock series called "The Paper," created by Greg Daniels. In the new show, his character has become an arts and leisure reporter for a struggling local newspaper in Ohio. In an interview, Nuñez reflects on the enduring legacy of his character, who helped some fans come out as gay, and his pride in playing a prominent Latino role. He also speaks candidly about the current political climate in the U.S., drawing parallels between the Trump administration and Fidel Castro's Cuba, and calls on other prominent Latino figures to speak out against anti-immigrant policies.</p>

          <p>NASA is using the James Webb Space Telescope to study TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-sized exoplanet located 40 light-years away that orbits within its star's habitable zone. Scientists are trying to determine if the planet has an atmosphere, which is a key ingredient for the potential presence of surface water and life. By analyzing how starlight is filtered as the planet passes in front of its star, researchers hope to identify the chemical makeup of any potential atmosphere. While initial observations have ruled out a light, hydrogen-based primary atmosphere, the possibility of a heavier, secondary atmosphere like Earth's remains an exciting area of ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Sixty years ago, on September 9, 1965, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax threw a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, one of the rarest feats in baseball. The event remains a celebrated moment in sports history, remembered for Koufax's dominance during his peak years and the iconic radio call by broadcaster Vin Scully. Koufax retired just one year later at the age of 30 due to arthritis, cementing his legendary status as a player who left the game at the height of his powers. The article reflects on the magic of that night and the mythical career of one of baseball's greatest pitchers.</p>
