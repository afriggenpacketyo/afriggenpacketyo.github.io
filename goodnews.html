          <p>President Trump is advocating for his "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a solution to what he describes as the "four disastrous years" under former President Joe Biden, emphasizing its potential to revitalize the U.S. economy. The bill, already passed by the House, includes provisions for significant tax cuts, spending cuts, and investments in American energy and infrastructure. Trump claims the bill will balance the budget, stimulate energy production, upgrade air travel infrastructure, and enhance border security. He also asserts it will repeal Biden's EV mandate and redirect SNAP benefits exclusively to Americans. </p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a legendary figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima, known as "Mr. Giants," was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, leading them to nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the team. His charismatic presence and on-field heroics made him a national icon during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. His death marks the end of an era for Japanese baseball, and he is fondly remembered by many as a symbol of the country's post-war resurgence. </p>

          <p>South Koreans are participating in a snap presidential election triggered by the ouster of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges related to his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest that Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win, capitalizing on public discontent with conservatives following the martial law controversy. The election's outcome will significantly shape the country's direction, with the new president immediately facing challenges such as a slowing economy and evolving threats from North Korea. The winning candidate will serve a single five-year term without the usual transition period. </p>
