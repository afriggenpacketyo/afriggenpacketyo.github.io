          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana following a federal judge's order and arrived in New Jersey. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days, with the Trump administration seeking his deportation due to his role in campus protests against Israel. Judge Fabiarz ruled Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, calling his detention an attempt to punish him for anti-Israel speech, while Representative Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of First Amendment rights. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, despite the administration's efforts to silence him.</p>

          <p>Sophie Cunningham, a WNBA player for the Indiana Fever, criticized WNBA referees for not adequately protecting teammate Caitlin Clark, stating this after a game where Cunningham committed a hard foul in defense of Clark. Cunningham's actions, resulting in a brawl and ejections, highlighted the ongoing concern that Clark is not receiving equal protection from referees, especially after controversial incidents where Clark was roughed up by opposing players. Former NBA player Joakim Noah had previously suggested the Fever acquire a player to protect Clark, and Cunningham's popularity has surged as fans view her as Clark's "enforcer", which she has earned, in part, due to her black belt in Taekwondo.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Judge Indira Talwani ruled the policy change, which capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually, threatening critical work in AI, cybersecurity, and semiconductors. This ruling follows similar blocks against funding caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

The release occurred shortly after President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, while European politicians and exiled Belarusian opposition members also welcomed the news.

          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street, resulting in injuries to dozens of passengers. The boat hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, causing passengers who were waiting to disembark to fall. Marine units escorted the yacht to a dock where passengers were unloaded, and 35 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, with 22 being taken to local hospitals for treatment. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which comes a month after a similar incident involving a Mexican navy ship striking the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>A BBC report offers a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges faced by GP receptionists during the 8 a.m. appointment rush, where patients frantically call to secure same-day appointments. Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham describe the intense demand and verbal abuse they sometimes face, highlighting the frustration of patients unable to book appointments. The Labour government's plan to end the early morning phone "scramble" with increased funding and online appointment systems aims to alleviate the pressure. The practice now includes an expanded team of health professionals to complement the work of family doctors, though a full solution remains elusive.</p>

South Arcade aims to capture a feeling of escapism and nostalgia, evoking a time when bedrooms were filled with personality and self-expression, as opposed to the minimalism of modern phone culture.</p>

          <p>A BBC article examines the prevalence of social media advice promising quick fixes to lower cortisol levels, warning against their effectiveness and potential harm. Experts caution that these 'quick fixes' often fail to address the root causes of stress and may prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment. Instead, they recommend tackling the underlying causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes, while also emphasizing the importance of consulting medical professionals for sudden body changes. Experts suggest that simple fixes on social media are not going to sort that.</p>

New recruits would receive the bonus after completing training and serving for two years, while former armed services personnel would be offered ¬£20,000 to return for two additional years.
