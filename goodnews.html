          <p>A private survey indicated that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew in August, driven by increased new orders and a recovery in export business, supported by a trade-war truce with the U.S. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index reached 50.5, exceeding economists' estimates and signaling the fastest expansion rate since March. Zichun Huang from Capital Economics noted the resilience of external demand despite tariffs, but Yao Yu of RatingDog cautioned that domestic demand remains soft. This contrasts with China's official manufacturing PMI, which showed a fifth consecutive month of contraction in August, highlighting a mixed economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government examines the feasibility of implementing a social media ban for individuals under 16, finding that while technically possible, all methods have risks and shortcomings. The ban, slated to take effect in December, aims to mitigate the harmful impacts of social media on children. The report evaluated various age verification methods, including government documents, parental approval, and facial recognition technology, recommending a layered approach for a more robust system. Concerns were raised about data privacy, accuracy, and potential circumvention through document forgeries and VPNs, as the government seeks to balance safety and privacy.</p>

Xi announced a talent scheme and advocated for the creation of an SCO development bank, signaling China's commitment to strengthening the organization's role as an Asian counterweight to the West.

          <p>A new book, *Power and the Palace*, recounts an incident where Queen Camilla, as a teenager, fought off an attempted sexual assault on a train to Paddington Station. The Queen reportedly told Boris Johnson about the experience in 2008, detailing how she used her shoe to defend herself, following her mother's advice. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the account, and sources close to the Queen say she has not previously shared this story publicly to avoid drawing attention away from the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault that she supports. The Queen's public work focuses on supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, advocating for survivors to come forward without fear or shame.</p>

Revenue at Alibaba's cloud division totaled 33.4 billion yuan, up 26% year-on-year, indicating the division's key role in monetizing artificial intelligence.

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has significantly altered the decor of the Oval Office, incorporating numerous gold details and increasing the number of paintings and artifacts. The changes, which Trump describes as "Trump touches," have been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the office as a symbol of a new golden age, while others criticize it as gaudy. The president has reportedly enlisted the help of a personal cabinet maker to add gilded carvings, with costs personally covered by Trump. The redesign places Trump in a tradition of presidents personalizing the Oval Office, but perhaps none have gone as far in transporting their pre-presidential aesthetic to Washington.</p>

However, parents report facing long waiting lists and staff shortages limiting availability, with nurseries struggling to meet rising demand.

Tencha prices have surged, and shops are limiting purchases to discourage hoarding, as online stores sold out months ago.
