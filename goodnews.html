          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' a violent confrontation between police and miners in June 1984. The incident, one of the most contentious episodes of the year-long miners' strike, left over 100 people injured and led to the arrest of 95 miners on charges that later collapsed in court amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for over 40 years, fulfilling a Labour party manifesto promise and bringing potential closure to affected mining communities who have long campaigned for justice.</p>

          <p>Steve Tandy has been named the new head coach of the Wales men's national rugby team, signing a contract that will see him lead the side at least until the 2027 World Cup. The 45-year-old Welshman joins from his role as Scotland's defence coach after the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) agreed to a release deal. Tandy takes over a team that has struggled recently, having experienced a record run of 18 consecutive Test defeats before a recent victory. His appointment marks a long-term strategic move by the WRU to rebuild the national team and restore its competitive standing in world rugby.</p>

          <p>In response to the deadly flash floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas earlier this month, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special legislative session. The session will focus on improving the state's preparedness for future flooding events. Key agenda items include discussions on enhancing flood warning systems, improving emergency communications, and securing relief funding for disaster recovery. The governor's announcement emphasizes the need to learn from the recent tragedy and ensure better preparation to protect communities from similar natural disasters in the future.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is home to a burgeoning luxury dog wellness industry, mirroring the self-care trends popular among humans. This niche market offers a wide array of services for pets, from sound baths and reiki meditation to aqua therapy and deluxe 'pawdicures.' The article follows a golden retriever named Dug as he experiences a week of pampering, including a chauffeured limo ride to a spa frequented by celebrity pets. This trend is driven by a focus on preventative care and a growing tendency for owners to view their dogs as children, though veterinarians caution against projecting human desires onto animals.</p>

          <p>A volunteer-run nonprofit, Dog Coalition Los Angeles, is tackling the city's animal shelter overpopulation crisis by supporting a community of foster homes for large dogs. The program provides fosters with training, guidance, and a peer network, which helps improve the dogs' chances of successful adoption and frees up critical kennel space. By carefully matching dogs with fosters and offering continued support like group leash-training classes, the organization not only helps socialize the animals but also builds lasting human friendships. This innovative approach makes fostering more accessible and effective, creating a positive impact for both the dogs and the people who care for them.</p>

          <p>A rare and notoriously stinky corpse flower is expected to bloom this week at The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California. The massive plant, nicknamed 'Green Boy,' will unfurl for only 24 to 48 hours, releasing its infamous odor often compared to rotting flesh, a strategy to attract pollinators. The Huntington has a large collection of these endangered plants and uses the popular blooming events to educate the public about plant conservation and biodiversity. Visitors can witness the spectacle in person, while a 24/7 livestream is available for those who cannot attend.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is now displaying “Realms of the Dharma: Buddhist Art Across Asia,” a major exhibition of around 180 splendid sculptures and paintings from its permanent collection. Many of these significant works have been in storage for nearly eight years due to the museum's campus reconstruction, making their return a notable event for local art enthusiasts. The exhibition showcases the diverse forms of Buddhist art that evolved over centuries across Asia, from India and Pakistan to China and Japan. The installation, which will be on view for a year, provides a rare opportunity to see these masterpieces together.</p>

          <p>A simple change to a 50-year-old federal law could help alleviate the U.S. housing crisis by making manufactured homes more affordable and appealing. The proposal involves removing the five-word mandate that requires these homes to be 'built on a permanent chassis,' a steel frame originally intended for mobility that is now largely obsolete. Advocates argue that eliminating this rule would reduce costs, allow for more architectural flexibility, and help overcome zoning barriers that have hindered the industry. After decades of legislative inertia, the proposal is gaining traction in Congress amid growing pressure to increase the nation's housing supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese government officials have called on the country's automakers to end what they describe as an 'irrational' price war in the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry. At a symposium attended by major carmakers like BYD, officials from several regulatory bodies stressed the urgency of curbing the intense competition. They urged leading companies to set an example by engaging in lawful and rational market practices. The intervention, which includes plans for cost oversight and price monitoring, aims to promote the healthy and sustainable development of China's rapidly growing but fiercely competitive electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly campaigning for better pay, highlighted by 'Pay us what you owe us' warm-up shirts at the All-Star Game, as negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) continue. The article examines the players' claims, noting that while the league has reported financial losses, key indicators like attendance, broadcast rights deals, and franchise valuations have seen significant growth. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far lower than in other major professional sports. This discrepancy, coupled with small roster sizes and low minimum salaries, forms the core of the players' argument for a greater share of the WNBA's increasing financial success.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the 'Safer Beauty Bill Package,' a set of four bills aimed at increasing federal oversight of the cosmetics industry and banning toxic ingredients from personal care products. The legislation addresses concerns that many products sold in the U.S. contain harmful chemicals linked to cancer and reproductive harm, with women of color and salon workers being disproportionately exposed. The bills seek to ban 18 of the most hazardous chemicals, require full ingredient transparency, and fund research into safer alternatives. This move follows the 2022 MoCRA law, which advocates say did not go far enough to ensure product safety.</p>

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China increased by over 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade agreement between the two nations. Beijing had previously placed export restrictions on these critical components, which are vital for technologies like electric vehicles and wind turbines, in response to U.S. tariffs. The surge in exports indicates that Chinese producers are now receiving the necessary licenses to ship the magnets. This development provides relief to American firms that had been facing shortages, but it also highlights the U.S.'s significant dependence on China's dominant position in the rare-earth supply chain.
