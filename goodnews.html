          <p>President Trump's nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as surgeon general has ignited controversy, particularly from figures like Laura Loomer, who questioned her lack of a current medical license and her embrace of alternative medicine. Despite the criticism, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended Means, citing her ability to inspire Americans to rethink the healthcare system. Means's brother, Calley Means, also defended his sister, emphasizing her commitment to addressing the root causes of disease. The surgeon general's role is largely symbolic, focused on public health advocacy and communication, as highlighted by former FDA head Dr. David A. Kessler, making Dr. Means's communication skills a key asset.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, arguing that its start date should be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria. This perspective aims to highlight China's role as a frontline against fascism, challenging the Western-centric view that marks Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland as the beginning of the global conflict. The academics made these points at a history seminar in Beijing, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the war's end. President Xi Jinping is set to attend Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, underscoring China's engagement with the war's legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports, marking a potential model for future trade negotiations. In return, the US agreed to allow Britain to export 100,000 cars annually with a 10% tariff and will remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The deal expands market access for American beef and bioethanol in the UK, while the UK gains a tariff-free quota of 13,000 tons for beef. While many details remain to be worked out, the agreement signals Trump's willingness to negotiate country-specific tariffs but not to scrap the 10% universal tariff.</p>

The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress to vote on the issue, while some players are protesting the rule by wearing shorts in matches.

The US deal left space for the UK to pursue a veterinary agreement with the EU, including alignment on standards in order to lower post Brexit red tape on food, farm and fish exports. Bailey emphasized that reversing the post-Brexit decline in UK-EU trade would be beneficial, as the EU remains the UK's largest trading partner, and that it's important to ensure that whatever decisions are taken on the Brexit front do not damage the long-term trade position.</p>
