          <p>Tom Cruise has been awarded a Guinness World Record for performing a daring stunt in "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning." The stunt involved Cruise jumping from a helicopter, deploying a parachute, and then setting it on fire while holding a 50-pound camera rig. He successfully completed the stunt 16 times, earning him the title for "most burning parachute jumps by an individual." Cruise's dedication to performing his own stunts is a hallmark of the "Mission: Impossible" franchise.</p>

          <p>International stocks are currently outperforming U.S. stocks so far this year, with the MSCI ACWI ex-USA index returning 15.7% compared to the S&P 500's 1.5%. This shift is driven by concerns over market volatility in the U.S. and relatively weaker performance compared to global counterparts. Financial professionals suggest that diversifying portfolios with foreign stocks is a savvy move over the long term. Adding foreign stocks can help guarantee exposure to different economic cycles and growth drivers. (not investment advice)</p>
