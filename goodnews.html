        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit counseling offers a structured approach to managing and reducing credit card debt through personalized plans and potential interest rate reductions. Certified credit counselors assess a client's financial situation and may recommend a debt management plan, consolidating monthly payments and negotiating with creditors to lower interest rates. While not a quick fix, credit counseling can be beneficial for individuals with manageable income but overwhelming debt, offering a structured repayment strategy typically completed in three to five years. This option is particularly useful for those ineligible for favorable loan terms due to credit score issues.</p>

This decision reflects some skepticism about vaccines within federal health agencies. The FDA requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects.

While economists generally agree that companies pass tariff costs to consumers, populists argue that large corporations have the power to absorb these costs. Elizabeth Wilkins of the Roosevelt Institute suggests companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices. Oren Cass of American Compass believes Walmart could influence suppliers to absorb costs or shift supply sources, rather than raising prices.</p>

          <p>For those struggling with credit card debt, debt relief options can offer a path to financial freedom, although the process may involve some unexpected features. Being behind on payments can help qualify for debt forgiveness, and smaller debt amounts may also be eligible for certain relief programs. Taking out another loan, such as a debt consolidation loan, can actually be advantageous by consolidating debts at a lower interest rate, streamlining repayment. Understanding these nuances is key to developing an effective debt relief strategy.</p>

          <p>Debt forgiveness can provide a path to becoming debt-free, but can you pursue it without destroying your credit score? In general, yes, debt forgiveness will hurt your credit. Debt forgiveness stays on your credit report for seven years, but the impact lessens over time, especially if you rebuild your credit with on-time payments, a low credit utilization ratio and responsible financial behavior.</p>

          <p>Google is introducing A.I. Mode, a new feature in its search engine that functions like a chatbot, allowing people to start a query, ask follow-up questions and use the company‚Äôs A.I. system to deliver comprehensive answers. With the introduction of A.I. Mode, Google is essentially trying to disrupt its traditional search business before upstart A.I. competitors can disrupt it. The A.I. transition comes amid mounting antitrust pressures to break up Google‚Äôs business.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted 66-22 late Monday to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill that aims to regulate some cryptocurrencies. The bill faced some Democratic opposition in recent weeks over President Donald Trump‚Äôs cryptocurrency ventures, but it ultimately garnered support from 16 Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The industry-backed measure establishes rules targeting stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset, often the U.S. dollar. </p>
