          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 20:50:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first rice crop in an ambitious trial, with ecologist Nadine Mitschunas overseeing the project in east England. The experiment, deemed a joke by many initially, thrived during the hottest summer on record, demonstrating the potential for new food sources in a changing climate. Nine varieties of rice, including risotto and basmati, are being cultivated in mini paddy fields as part of a UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology initiative. Beyond food production, the project aims to address climate change by re-wetting peat soils, which helps lock away greenhouse gases and could offer a sustainable farming model for the future. While commercial planting is still some time away, UK-grown rice could become a reality within the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David Ellison, are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media landscape, with potential deals involving major companies like TikTok, CNN, and Paramount. Larry Ellison's close ties with President Trump have reportedly facilitated these ventures, with Trump publicly praising the elder Ellison's business acumen. David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control over CBS, and is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which includes CNN and HBO. This strategic expansion, backed by Larry Ellison's vast fortune, positions the family to become a new media dynasty, drawing scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about a dangerous concentration of power and potential political influence over news outlets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the experience of using a shoe rack. Their research, stemming from observations in university hostels, found that the pervasive odor, caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, often led people to keep footwear outdoors. The team conducted surveys and experiments, discovering that a brief exposure to ultraviolet C (UVC) light could effectively kill the microbes and eliminate the smell without damaging the shoes. This delightfully unconventional scientific endeavor led to a prototype for a UVC-equipped shoe rack, aiming to enhance user experience and solve a universal domestic problem.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless claims of election rigging in 2020. Giuliani, then President Trump's personal lawyer, had publicly alleged that Dominion's systems were manipulated to favor Joe Biden, contributing to a web of conspiracy theories that undermined public confidence in US elections. This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion reached with Fox News and Newsmax. The lawsuit was part of a series of legal and financial setbacks for Giuliani, who has also been disbarred, filed for bankruptcy, and was ordered to pay $148 million to two Georgia election workers he defamed.</p>

          <p>Europe has established an unprecedented 11½–4½ lead over the United States in the Ryder Cup, heading into the final day's singles matches and requiring only two and a half more points for retention. The commanding performance by the European team overshadowed a day marred by disruptive and personal insults from American fans, particularly targeting Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. Despite attempts by US player Justin Thomas to quiet hecklers, many offensive spectators were removed, highlighting a dismal scene. On-course tensions also flared between Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau.

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his forthcoming book 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing justice. Kennedy, an appointed conservative, reflects on how 'the cases swung, not me,' particularly on controversial issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. He expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse, noting its shift from reasoned debate to antagonism, and worries about increasing partisanship within Supreme Court opinions. The article highlights his personal evolution, including a reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia after a contentious dissent, and his complex views on abortion, balancing moral objections with constitutional liberty. Kennedy also critiques judicial originalism, advocating for an understanding of liberty that evolves over time.</p>

          <h2>Collagen Supplements: Do They Really Reduce Signs of Skin Ageing?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging remains a subject of skepticism among dermatologists, despite their widespread popularity. Collagen, the body's most abundant protein, naturally declines with age, leading many to seek supplements in various forms. While some users report positive changes in skin, hair, and nails, consultant dermatologists like Emma Wedgeworth question whether ingested collagen peptides effectively reach the skin. Industry-funded studies often suggest benefits, but research without such conflicts of interest frequently shows no significant effect on skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles. Experts advise that consistent use of sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking are far more impactful strategies for maintaining youthful skin than collagen supplements.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK has pledged to begin construction on three new towns before the next general election, as part of its vision to boost the economy through housebuilding. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of 12 proposed locations. Each new town is expected to feature at least 10,000 homes, with a collective potential for 300,000 homes across England in the coming decades, and at least 40% designated as affordable housing. Labour plans to establish a New Towns Unit with special planning powers to secure funding and invest in essential local services and infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Dream of homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many due to a nationwide housing affordability crisis and a significant shortage of units. Modular homebuilder Fading West aims to address this by constructing homes in a factory setting, reducing costs by up to 20% and halving construction time compared to traditional methods. The company successfully deployed 82 modular homes for wildfire victims in Lahaina, Maui, demonstrating rapid, cost-effective solutions. This approach, which involves building homes in sections and assembling them on-site, could provide a sustainable model for increasing affordable housing supply and tackling labor shortages in the construction industry.
