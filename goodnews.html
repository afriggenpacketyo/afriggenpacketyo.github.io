        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This week's inflation report is expected to provide initial insights into the effects of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs on pricing in the United States. While economists initially feared a surge in inflation, early data suggests a slight cooldown in April, with prices expected to have increased by 2.3% year-over-year. However, analysts anticipate a potential resurgence of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs were implemented. Trump has since eased some tariffs, reducing the potential impact on household costs, though Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Reconsiders Immigrant Health Coverage Amid Rising Costs</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing a health care crisis as costs for the state's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, have spiraled out of control, partly due to the expansion of coverage to immigrants without legal status. With a deepening state budget crisis, Newsom must consider rolling back coverage or finding alternative budget cuts. The governor's decision is complicated by tepid public support for providing health care to immigrants without legal status and potential harm to his political legacy. Lawmakers are considering options such as freezing enrollment or restricting benefits, but any cuts would be contentious.</p>
