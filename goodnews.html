          <p>Downtown Los Angeles restaurants are struggling to regain business despite the recent lifting of a curfew imposed after demonstrations protesting immigration policies. Many storefronts remain boarded up, and restaurants have experienced significant drops in reservations, with some losing up to 80% of their bookings. The curfew, intended to quell chaos, has had a lasting impact on the perception of safety in the area, discouraging diners from visiting. However, there are signs of recovery, with some restaurants reopening and residents expressing support for local businesses, and community leaders urging people to rally behind downtown. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, citing ongoing efforts to reach a deal separating TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance. This is the third delay since his inauguration in January, with the previous extension expiring Thursday, as Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support, giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services, citing national security concerns. Trump expressed confidence that China would ultimately approve a deal, reiterating his support for TikTok, where he claims to have been very popular. Despite the delays, some lawmakers are sounding the alarm, urging the administration to enforce the law. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fox Corp. has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to expand its sports programming and attract more customers to its streaming services. Carlos Martinez, a former executive at Turner, Discovery, and Fox, has been appointed as executive vice president and managing director of Latin America for Fox Corp. The acquisition is part of Fox's strategy to bolster its sports content as streaming becomes the dominant way for viewers to watch TV, with plans to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, later this year, adding to its existing Tubi service. The acquisition will provide Fox with a broader portfolio of original sports content, including broadcast rights to the Big Ten Conference, The United Football League, and the Premier League and the FA Cup. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, doubling the number of households eligible for ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter. Anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the discount, regardless of property size, though the cost may be covered by raising fees on all customer bills. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk, including those on non-means tested benefits. The government also plans to expand automatic compensation schemes for energy customers, including compensation for long hold times and unexpectedly high bills. </p>

Temperatures are expected to peak at 33C on Saturday, particularly in central and eastern England, while regional fire services have issued warnings about water safety. The rising temperatures are due to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, but a change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler temperatures. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the psychology of taking offense and strategies for managing reactions in an age of heightened polarization and online discourse. Drawing on research, it explains how offenses trigger the brain's limbic system, leading to emotional responses, and how the prefrontal cortex can inhibit aggression. The author suggests strategies for controlling one's response, including laughing off minor offenses, using the prefrontal cortex through practices like meditation, and tuning out offense-making media. The piece also considers how some people may feign offense for personal gain, highlighting the importance of discerning genuine harm from manipulative behavior. </p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by reflecting on the role quilts may have played in the Underground Railroad, using coded messages to guide runaway enslaved people to freedom. Edmunds learned to sew at age seven and has been making quilts for decades, but it wasn't until 50 years ago that she discovered the hidden language in quilt patterns. While some historians debate the evidence of coded quilts, Edmunds and her daughter believe in their significance, drawing parallels to West African pictographs and symbols used for communication. Edmunds hopes to educate younger generations about the history of the Underground Railroad and the struggles of enslaved people, particularly in light of current efforts to restrict discussions about slavery in schools. </p>
