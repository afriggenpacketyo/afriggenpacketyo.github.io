          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant weekly gain, rising roughly 13% after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, easing tensions with the Trump administration over tariff policies. This positive momentum has pushed the stock to its highest level since April, reassuring investors about the company's standing. Separately, the financial world is watching reports that the administration plans a historic stock offering for government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a deal potentially valued at over $500 billion.

          <p>Stargazers anticipating the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower next week may face disappointment due to a brightly illuminated moon. The American Meteor Society warns that the waning gibbous moon, which will be 84% full during the August 12-13 peak, could reduce visibility by as much as 75%. This celestial interference means viewers in North America can expect to see only 10-20 meteors per hour, a significant decrease from the typical 50 or more under dark sky conditions. Experts suggest viewing a week after the peak for a better, albeit less intense, show.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's recent sanctions targeting Indian refineries, such as Nayara Energy, for processing and exporting products from Russian crude are unlikely to derail long-term EU-India trade negotiations. Experts believe the sanctions are largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India currently stems from the threat of significant U.S. tariffs. This American pressure could paradoxically strengthen India's resolve to finalize a free trade agreement with the EU to diversify its economic partnerships. India's potential pivot away from Russian oil to avoid U.S. tariffs could also align with the EU's strategic goals in the region.</p>

Following the original company's bankruptcy and liquidation, its intellectual property was acquired and is now being licensed by The Brand House Collective to operate new retail locations. The new store will honor the brand's legacy by accepting old 20% off coupons, regardless of their expiration date. The company plans to convert dozens more of its existing Kirkland's Home stores into the new format if the initial launch proves successful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses a record $1.21 trillion, consumers are facing increased pressure from average interest rates near 22%. This article outlines several strategies to mitigate or eliminate these compounding charges. Key methods include transferring balances to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR, which can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months to pay down principal. Other options involve enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program for temporary relief, using a personal loan for debt consolidation at a lower rate, or paying off the balance before the statement closing date.

          <p>With the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, a Certificate of Deposit (CD) laddering strategy is being highlighted as a particularly sensible approach for savers. This method involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates, allowing individuals to lock in current high rates while maintaining access to their funds at regular intervals. Given the current economic unpredictability and the inversion where short-term CDs often offer higher rates than long-term ones, laddering provides both high returns and crucial financial flexibility. This approach helps savers navigate the changing rate environment without locking all their money away for extended periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University believe they may have discovered the shipwreck of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer that exploded during an attack on a colonial North Carolina port in 1748. The discovery was made at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site, along with the remains of three other vessels. Wood samples from the primary wreck suggest construction materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The remarkably preserved timbers have been recovered for further study and conservation.</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided the clearest image yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat and will pass closer to Mars than Earth. Hubble's observations have refined the size estimate of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across, revealing a teardrop-shaped dust plume and tail. While most scientists view it as a natural phenomenon, some, like Harvard's Avi Loeb, have noted its unusual characteristics and suggest monitoring it for signs of artificial technology.</p>

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" turns 100, this article reflects on its lasting power, particularly its exploration of midlife. The book, which follows its 51-year-old protagonist over a single day, is praised for its ability to resonate differently with readers at various stages of life. While younger readers may focus on its modernist style and depiction of post-WWI trauma, older readers often connect with Clarissa Dalloway's poignant reflections on aging, mortality, and past choices. The article highlights the novel as a masterpiece of the midlife crisis, capturing both the anxieties and affirmations of that pivotal life stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major tech companies like Meta and Alphabet are reporting strong advertising revenue, attributing the growth to the successful integration of artificial intelligence tools that enhance ad system efficiency. Meta noted a particular improvement in spending from Asia-based e-commerce firms, signaling a rebound in that sector. In contrast, smaller social media platforms such as Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm quarterly results, with Snap citing a botched ad platform update and Pinterest still seeing tariff-related uncertainty. The trend suggests that in the current market, advertisers are gravitating toward larger, more stable platforms, widening the gap between tech's biggest players and their competitors.

          <p>Shares in rare earth miner MP Materials rose after the company reported a narrowed second-quarter loss and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, a critical component for magnets in electric vehicles and electronics.

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has generated over £250 million in the last three years solely from selling players developed in its own academy. This strategy, accelerated under the current ownership to comply with financial regulations, uses the sale of homegrown talent—which counts as 'pure profit'—to fund significant spending on new players. Recent sales, including Armando Broja's £20 million move to Burnley, have been crucial for balancing the books amid transfer spending set to exceed £300 million this summer. While successful financially, the approach highlights the tension between fiscal compliance and integrating academy graduates into the first team. (not investment advice)</p>
