          <p>The Trump administration has restored federal research grants to Brown University following a new agreement between the two parties. In exchange for the renewed funding, Brown has committed to donating $50 million to local workforce development programs and implementing changes related to women's sports, antisemitism surveys, and admissions data transparency. The university, which explicitly denies any wrongdoing or liability, noted that the agreement does not grant the government authority over its curriculum or academic speech. This resolution follows a similar multi-million dollar settlement reached by Columbia University earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>By deciding not to run for governor of California in 2026, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. An analysis suggests that running for governor would have likely required her to renounce any immediate White House ambitions to win over California voters. The move avoids the practical difficulties of governing the nation's largest state while simultaneously campaigning for president. While her path is unclear, she remains a nominal front-runner for the Democratic nomination due to her name recognition and fundraising network, though she would likely face a large field of challengers.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) and UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting have agreed to resume talks following the conclusion of the latest five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The walkout, the 12th since spring 2023, occurred after previous negotiations broke down. Streeting stated he is not willing to negotiate on pay but will resume discussions on working conditions, such as career progression and exam fees. He warned the union that the recent strike had squandered the government's goodwill, but confirmed his door remains open for talks to resume early next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles's Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) has appointed Ann Goldstein, a former senior curator, as its interim director. The leadership change follows the announcement that current director Johanna Burton will be leaving to lead the Institute of Contemporary Art in Pennsylvania. Burton's departure marks another transition for MOCA, which has seen five directors leave since 2008. Goldstein has a long history with the museum, having worked there for over two decades before holding leadership roles at other major institutions, and is seen as a stabilizing choice while an international search for a permanent director begins.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in an 8-7 vote to move the bill forward. The proposed legislation, which Hawley agreed to rename the Honest Act, would require lawmakers to divest their individual stock holdings. The bill's future is uncertain in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Trump later criticized Hawley for working with Democrats on the measure after initially expressing conceptual support.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced the repatriation of an American child from the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, a sprawling facility holding tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to ISIS. The child, who will be reunified with family in the U.S., has spent their entire life in the camp. The U.S. continues to urge other nations to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and similar camps, citing dire humanitarian conditions and security risks. This repatriation occurs as the U.S. encourages the new Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces to unify control over the region.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California, ending months of speculation about her next political move after her 2024 presidential election loss. In a statement, the former vice-president said her public service would not be in elected office for now, but she vowed to remain active in politics by helping elect Democrats. Her decision clears the way for a crowded field of candidates vying to lead the nation's most populous state. Allies suggest she may explore other avenues, such as leading a non-profit or policy organization.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach while monitoring the economic impact of tariffs. In a rare show of public disagreement, two members of the rate-setting committee voted to lower rates, but the majority, led by Chair Jerome Powell, prevailed. Powell cited ongoing inflation concerns and a solid economy as reasons for holding steady, despite public pressure from President Trump to cut rates. He noted the economy is not performing as if it were being held back by restrictive policy. (not investment advice)</p>
