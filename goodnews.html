          <p>A father is being praised for his heroic actions after he jumped from the fourth deck of a Disney cruise ship to save his young daughter who had fallen into the ocean. The incident occurred as the ship was returning to Florida from the Bahamas, with witnesses stating the girl fell while her father was taking her picture. A man overboard alert was quickly issued, and the ship's crew launched a rescue boat, successfully recovering both the father and daughter, who had been treading water for approximately ten minutes. Disney Cruise Line commended its crew for their swift and skillful response, which ensured a safe outcome in a situation that, according to statistics, often ends tragically.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film '40 Acres' presents a post-apocalyptic world where a military veteran, played intensely by Danielle Deadwyler, defends her family's fortified farm from cannibals in rural Canada. Set after a pandemic wiped out animals and crops, the story follows the isolationist Freeman family as they struggle to survive through strict, militaristic discipline. The review praises Deadwyler's performance for conveying both strength and the deep-seated pain of generational trauma. While the film's direction is seen as occasionally heavy-handed, its compelling tension, strong performances, and exploration of trust and survival make it a resolute and gripping debut feature.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill.' The proposed tax would have targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China and could have cost the industry up to $7 billion. Following its removal, shares for major renewable developers like NextEra Energy and residential installer Sunrun saw notable gains. Despite this positive development, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association warned that the overall bill remains detrimental to the renewable sector, as it still phases out crucial investment tax credits.

          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has identified the best job markets in the U.S., ranking cities on metrics like unemployment, income growth, and work-life balance. Bend, Oregon, claimed the top spot, praised for its low 3.1% unemployment rate, strong 44% income growth since 2020, and excellent quality of life factors like short commutes and a high percentage of remote workers. Other high-ranking cities include Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington. The study also highlighted cities that excel in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for employer-provided healthcare coverage and Frisco, Texas, for the highest percentage of remote workers.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper secured his spot in the next round of Wimbledon with a commanding opening performance against Argentina's Sebastian Baez. Draper, the British number one and fourth seed, was leading 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez was forced to retire due to an injury sustained after slipping on the Court One baseline. While Draper expressed a desire to have won the match outright, the confident start marks only his third main-draw victory at the All England Club. As the host nation's primary hope following Andy Murray's retirement, Draper will now face a more experienced grass-court challenge in 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic.</p>

Starting immediately, all new domains on Cloudflare's network will be opted-out of allowing AI bots, giving publishers control over their content and the ability to charge for access. The company, which handles roughly 16% of global internet traffic, argues that AI firms have been collecting data without limit, depriving creators of traffic and revenue.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is investing billions in recruiting top-tier artificial intelligence talent, a spending spree that could add $1 billion in annual expenses, yet Wall Street has remained supportive. Analysts believe investors are willing to overlook the high costs due to the immense potential AI offers for both revenue growth and operational cost savings. The push includes high-profile hires from competitors like OpenAI and Google to build a 'superintelligence' unit. While these investments have already improved user engagement and ad targeting on Facebook and Instagram, the long-term challenge will be to monetize these efforts through new products, like a more capable Llama language model.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led 'big beautiful' bill that recently passed the Senate includes a new temporary tax deduction aimed at providing relief for seniors. The provision, described as a 'senior bonus,' would offer an additional deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers aged 65 and over, phasing out for those with higher incomes. This measure is being pursued instead of President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits entirely, which is prohibited under the Senate's reconciliation rules. While the deduction would primarily benefit low-to-middle-income seniors, fiscal watchdogs warn it could accelerate the depletion of Social Security's trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The massive spending bill passed by Senate Republicans includes a provision to expand the federal child tax credit, though its structure differs from the House version. The Senate bill would permanently increase the maximum credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and index it to inflation after 2025. This is a key feature of the broader legislation, which now must be reconciled with the House's proposal for a temporary increase to $2,500. Policy experts note that despite the increase, the credit's current structure, which limits refundability for the lowest earners, means that some families with very low incomes will still not receive the full benefit.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan for mass layoffs and a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 state attorneys general, who argued the reorganization would cause 'severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible' harm to public health services nationwide. The judge found 'no rational basis' for the plan, which would have laid off some 10,000 employees and overhauled agencies like the CDC and FDA. The court determined the executive branch likely exceeded its authority and failed to prove that critical services would continue uninterrupted.</p>
