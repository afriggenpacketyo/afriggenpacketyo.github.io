          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its 5.7-liter V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 full-size pickup trucks, after discontinuing it last year. The decision is a reversal amid slower-than-expected EV adoption and the Trump administration's efforts to unwind initiatives pushing the auto industry away from gas engines. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to cancel the Hemi was a mistake and expects it to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 sales. The Hemi will be a $1,200 option on most models, alongside the more efficient Hurricane engine. (not investment advice)</p>
