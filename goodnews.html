          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament, finishing at 10-under 278, and becoming the second player after Tiger Woods to win the tournament in consecutive years. Scheffler's consistent performance included only one bogey over the final 40 holes, demonstrating his relentless competitive drive. Ben Griffin finished second, earning $2.2 million, while Sepp Straka finished third. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus praised Scheffler's playing style, comparing it to his own strategy of focusing on fairways and greens, and making enough putts to secure a low score. The total purse for the Memorial Tournament was $20 million, with Scheffler taking home $4,000,000 for his victory.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in the high jump and triple jump. The CIF implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports. The event drew both supporters and protesters, with some holding signs and banners, and one arrest was made following an altercation between counterprotesters.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon and working to formally block it. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine Americans' views of the federal government. She contrasts her actions with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons, and has sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to formally acknowledge her non-acceptance. Hemphill expects her protest to garner attention from the former president.</p>

The report also notes the importance of Australian soap operas as training grounds and the anti-diva attitude of many Aussie performers. Baz Luhrmann believes Australia's remoteness allows actors to develop their talents without the pressures of Hollywood.</p>
