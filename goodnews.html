        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is set to invest an additional $4 billion in Wisconsin for a second data center, complementing its initial $3.3 billion investment in a nearby Mount Pleasant facility slated to be operational by early 2026. The first data center will house a significant number of Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs to manage AI models, catering to the rising demand for cloud infrastructure. Microsoft aims to match its energy consumption with carbon-free energy sources, utilizing a solar farm under construction to contribute 250 megawatts of power. This expansion underscores Microsoft's commitment to AI development and sustainable energy practices, while also revitalizing land previously intended for a Foxconn plant. Optimism around this endeavor is tied to its potential for economic growth and technological advancement in the region. The project is expected to be completed in 2027 or later.</p>

          <p>Jose Mourinho has been appointed as the new manager of Benfica, signing a deal until the summer of 2027, succeeding Bruno Lage after a Champions League defeat. This marks Mourinho's return to management shortly after his dismissal from Fenerbahce and a previous brief stint with Benfica in 2000. Despite Lage's recent success, Mourinho inherits a team in sixth place in the Primeira Liga, aiming to improve their standing.

          <p>The stock market experienced fluctuations as Wall Street anticipated and then reacted to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The Fed announced a quarter percentage point reduction, the first since December 2024, but Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that this doesn't guarantee a full-blown rate-lowering cycle. Over the past month, Palo Alto Networks, Broadcom, and Eli Lilly were top performers, while Starbucks, Danaher, and Boeing lagged. Broadcom can thank a fantastic earnings report in early September for its outperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel to co-develop data center and PC chips, marking a significant collaboration between the two tech giants. Nvidia's investment, priced at $23.28 a share, caused Intel shares to jump 24%. Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms, and x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX GPUs for PCs. This partnership joins Softbank and the U.S. government in supporting Intel's turnaround, though it remains unclear if Nvidia will manufacture at Intel's foundries.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor is increasing its revenue expectations for this year but lowering its expected operating profit margin for 2025 due to ongoing U.S. tariffs. The South Korean automaker revised its financial targets ahead of a CEO investor day in New York City, reconfirming its growth plans to increase annual sales to 5.55 million by 2030. The investor event comes at a sensitive time, following an immigration raid at a jointly owned battery plant between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution in Georgia.

          <p>This article discusses the evolving understanding of gender identity in young children, particularly focusing on those who have transitioned from one gender to another. In the early 2010s, the social transition of minors was still controversial, but a new perspective emerged suggesting that trans children possess a clear understanding of their identity. As a result, an increasing number of parents began supporting their young children's social transitions, sometimes as early as age three. The article will likely explore the long-term stability of these gender identities and the factors influencing them.</p>
