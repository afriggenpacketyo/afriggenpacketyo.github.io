          <p>Childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 154 million deaths over the past 50 years, since the WHO launched its Essential Programme on Immunization. However, a recent study in The Lancet indicates that progress in boosting vaccination rates has stalled or reversed in many countries since 2010. Factors such as conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation contribute to these challenges. While India has shown success in reducing the number of zero-dose children, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to vaccination efforts.</p>

The discovery provides insights into the evolution of early small dinosaurs into larger and more specialized species.

Producing beef can generate significant greenhouse gas emissions, and there are arguments about whether the environmental benefits of lab-grown meat have been oversold. Critics also raise concerns about the ultra-processed nature of lab-grown meat and the potential for production to be dominated by multinational companies. While lab-grown meat has been approved for sale in some countries, challenges remain in scaling up production and reducing costs.</p>
