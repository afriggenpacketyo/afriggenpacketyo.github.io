          <p>President Trump signed deals to create a 10-mile campus in Abu Dhabi that will transform the United Arab Emirates into an A.I. powerhouse, supplied by American-made A.I. chips. The project is part of the "U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership" and will be supported by 5 gigawatts of electrical power. While the Commerce Department states the U.A.E. is committed to safeguarding A.I. technologies, some officials have expressed concerns about protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China. Experts consider A.I. a transformative technology with implications for economic and military power, and the deal is viewed as a major milestone in achieving President Trump‚Äôs vision for U.S. A.I. dominance.</p>

Other anniversary offerings include projection shows on It's a Small World and Carthay Circle, as well as additions to existing attractions.

          <p>Republican-backed legislation is unlikely to include a tax break on Social Security benefits, despite President Trump's previous suggestion, due to restrictions on making changes to the program through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill includes an additional $4,000 deduction for filers 65 and older. Eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the program's long-term outlook, potentially depleting the trust fund sooner. The article clarifies the complexities of Social Security taxation and the political challenges of making changes.</p>
