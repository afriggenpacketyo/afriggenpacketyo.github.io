          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing unfinished marble sculptures and other artifacts. The excavation at the Floga archaeological site uncovered new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, documenting continuous use of the site from the late 5th to the 4th century BC. The finds include semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop.</p>

Chief executives are reportedly puzzled by the government's caution, despite its large majority, and seek reassurance about support for green technology investments. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, with plans to allocate 2.7% of GDP to capital spending, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not a valid form of identification for air travel. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The TSA emphasized this message on Facebook, responding to confusion likely stemming from the gold stars on Costco membership cards, which resemble the star on REAL ID-compliant cards. Travelers are reminded to present appropriate identification documents for airport security screenings.</p>

          <h2>China's Demographic Crisis Could Ease with Male Childcare Subsidies, Research Suggests</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The study comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The proposal aims to address traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, which clash with rapid economic changes.</p>
