          <p>United Launch Alliance has postponed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather conditions at Cape Canaveral. Originally scheduled for Friday, the launch is now set for June 16, aiming to deploy another 27 satellites into low Earth orbit, increasing the constellation to 54. Amazon is accelerating satellite deployments to begin customer service later this year, competing with SpaceX's Starlink, with plans to launch over 3,000 satellites and meet the FCC deadline of launching half by July 2026. The first successful launch occurred in April, dispatching 27 satellites. Optimism regarding the project's progress remains moderate due to external factors such as weather conditions.</p>
