          <p>Analysts suggest that trade relations between the U.S. and China are experiencing a period of stability following heightened tensions and tariff battles. Both countries appear to be retreating from extreme positions, aiming for an eventual agreement. A temporary pause, initiated in May, is expected to last three months, potentially capping tariffs and encouraging resumed rare earth exports from China. While the Iran crisis introduces some uncertainty, its impact on a U.S.-China deal is projected to be minimal, with any effects primarily limited to rhetoric. Optimism is growing that a more organized and moderated approach to negotiations will lead to a resolution. </p>

          <p>For individuals approaching retirement, annuities are increasingly considered as a means to secure guaranteed monthly income. A $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could yield monthly payments ranging from approximately $1,200 to $1,300, influenced by factors such as gender, annuity type, and prevailing interest rates. Women typically receive slightly lower monthly amounts due to longer life expectancies, and the annuity structure impacts payouts, with single-life annuities offering higher payments that cease upon death. The decision to purchase an annuity should align with an individual's broader retirement income strategy, considering factors like Social Security benefits, longevity expectations, and liquidity needs.

          <p>Spain's Constitutional Court has largely upheld the amnesty law for Catalan separatists involved in the 2017 independence push. The law has pardoned over 300 people and was part of an agreement between the Socialist Party and Catalan separatist parties to maintain Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in power. The conservative opposition has criticized the law as unconstitutional, but the court, with a Socialist-nominated majority, rejected most points of their appeal. However, the ruling does not directly benefit Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan separatist leader who remains in self-imposed exile due to embezzlement charges. </p>

He believes that opposing wars and prioritizing domestic prosperity can help the party rebuild trust and win back disaffected voters. Khanna has joined forces with Republican congressman Thomas Massie to sponsor a war powers resolution requiring congressional approval for military action against Iran, aiming to reassert congressional authority over war-making. </p>

The survey also reveals that a majority of CFOs (64%) believe tariffs will negatively affect the economy, and all CFOs acknowledge that current policy uncertainty is impacting their ability to make business decisions. CFOs anticipate bond yields on the 10-year Treasury to remain elevated, and most do not expect inflation to return to the Fed's target rate of 2% before the second half of 2026.

          <p>Japan's transport ministry is considering changes to delivery rules to promote contactless drop-offs and reduce redeliveries, addressing the driver shortage. The ministry held its first panel meeting to discuss measures needed to prevent theft and damage when parcels are left unattended. Panel members also raised concerns about security and privacy when drivers enter residential premises while customers are away. Participants discussed ways to encourage customers to install parcel boxes and lockers. </p>
