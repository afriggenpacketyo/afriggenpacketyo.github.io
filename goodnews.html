          <p>Bill Gates plans to donate most of his wealth to meet urgent needs, criticizing cuts to USAID led by Elon Musk. Gates predicted the cuts would increase childhood deaths in poor countries. The Gates Foundation will divest nearly his entire fortune within 20 years to improve lives around the world. He hopes to reduce child and maternal mortality, fight diseases, and reduce global poverty. The foundation plans to double its giving to $200 billion by 2045, after which it will be dissolved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces potential criticism for being perceived as slow to act, regardless of his decisions on interest rates. Some economists believe Powell's cautious approach, given the volatile policy mix with Trump's tariffs, leaves him in a no-win situation. President Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and labor market, dismissing the idea of pre-emptive cuts. Economists note that the Fed's reliance on labor market data could lead to delayed action, potentially missing the mark on addressing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>As the Philippines prepares for midterm polls, many young voters aim to end the concentration of political power among entrenched political dynasties. Voters will decide half the Senate's seats and thousands of local posts. The vote will likely determine the political future of Vice President Sara Duterte, who was impeached in February. Recent reports indicate that most of the country's provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties, with some considered "obese" due to multiple family members seeking elected positions.</p>
