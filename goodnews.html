          <p>The French navy successfully seized nearly 10 tons of cocaine, with an estimated market value of over $600 million, from a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa. The operation was conducted by two navy ships following a tip from anti-drug authorities and British police. This seizure is part of France's long-standing Corymbe naval mission, which aims to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea. The action highlights ongoing international efforts to combat large-scale drug trafficking in the region.</p>

This positive data comes alongside other strong economic reports, including an upward revision of second-quarter GDP growth to 3.8% and a surprising increase in durable goods orders. These indicators provide a more optimistic economic picture despite recent concerns at the Federal Reserve that had prompted an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

Construction for the new venue, which is significantly larger than the main White House building itself, began earlier this month on the South Lawn.

          <p>FIFA is set to discuss a proposal from South America's football confederation, Conmebol, to expand the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams. The expansion is suggested as a way to celebrate the tournament's 100-year anniversary, which will be co-hosted across three continents. The idea has sparked debate, with proponents highlighting increased inclusivity and revenue, while critics, including UEFA's president, raise concerns about logistical challenges and a potential dilution of the tournament's competitive quality. The current format is already set to expand to 48 teams in 2026.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education launched the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on Wednesday, a full week before its anticipated October 1 start date. Experts are calling this a significant win for college-bound students, as the previous application cycle was plagued by delays and technical glitches with a newly designed form. Early submission is crucial because some financial aid is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, and the timely opening is hoped to boost completion rates.</p>
