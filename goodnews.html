          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) summoned representatives from Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address concerns over an escalating delivery price war. The meeting was intended to promote rational competition and ensure a healthy market for consumers, merchants, and platform operators. The regulator emphasized that these companies must comply with e-commerce and anti-unfair competition laws. In a separate meeting, the SAMR also addressed food safety issues in the live-streaming e-commerce sector, noting instances of excessive additives and pesticide residues in some products.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Promise in Return Despite Team's Loss to Brewers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his second start since returning from injury, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing was a positive sign, showcasing increased fastball velocity and a more athletic, less mechanical approach on the mound. He has been working to overcome a history of injuries and mental blocks by simplifying his mindset and focusing on execution. The Dodgers are counting on Glasnow and the soon-to-return Blake Snell to bolster their starting rotation for a potential World Series run.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China regarding strategies to counter Beijing's "economic coercion." Morrison's government faced significant trade tariffs from China after calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. His testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, concludes a visit to China aimed at warming diplomatic and trade relations. Also testifying is Rahm Emanuel, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan and a vocal critic of China's use of economic pressure against other nations.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Disciplinary Body Highlights Local Government Mismanagement with Failed Tourism Project</h2>

          <p>China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, intended as a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after a broken capital chain and poor decision-making by local officials. The project, which received only a fraction of its planned 1.65 billion yuan investment, is now being publicly shamed as a warning to other local governments against pursuing unrealistic initiatives. The official who backed the project has been expelled from the Communist Party and found guilty of misappropriating funds.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, support the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. This enthusiasm is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The survey also found that an overwhelming majority believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile achievement for the nation. Public sentiment generally indicates that the space program contributes positively to national pride and, to a lesser extent, to technological advancements that benefit society as a whole. These views are consistent across different political and ideological groups.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are making significant inroads in the global AI landscape by championing open-source models, presenting a strong alternative to the closed systems of U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google. The recent release of powerful, free-to-use models from firms such as DeepSeek has been met with enthusiasm from developers worldwide, challenging the previous dominance of American AI. This open-source approach encourages collaborative development and has unleashed a new wave of AI applications in China. Analysts suggest that this movement poses a more serious challenge to proprietary systems than previous open-source efforts in other tech sectors.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current ceasefire proposal reportedly includes the return of these 10 hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes after Trump stated that Israel had agreed to the necessary conditions for a truce. Separately, reports indicate that Israel's Mossad chief visited Washington to discuss the potential relocation of Palestinians from Gaza with other countries.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Corporal Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, found solace in a small music box that inspired visions of a peaceful carousel. After returning home and struggling with PTSD, Harrison decided to make his vision a reality. He spent 26 years restoring a broken-down carousel and hand-carving new animals for it. In 2010, he opened the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, a nonprofit that has since brought joy to over a million visitors. Harrison says that seeing others experience happiness at the carousel has been the best medicine for his own trauma.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first significant regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation specifically governs stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, and establishes consumer protections. At the signing ceremony, Trump hailed the law as a step toward an "exciting new frontier," suggesting it could be the greatest revolution in financial technology since the internet. The act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move supporters believe will strengthen the dollar and modernize the financial system.

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system needs to rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. Shin Hyun-Song, a BIS economic adviser, highlighted that the rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures. He noted that the borderless and pseudonymous nature of these digital tokens could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and fulfill know-your-customer requirements. The warning comes as the market for stablecoins and other digital currencies grows rapidly, attracting increased attention from regulators worldwide, including in Hong Kong.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to transport blood effectively, causing it to pool in the legs. Medical experts note that CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often managed with lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and compression stockings. The president's doctor stated that there were no signs of more serious cardiovascular issues and declared Trump to be in "excellent health."</p>
