          <p>Two tickets, sold in Missouri and Texas, have won the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, and 62, with Powerball 17, marking the end of a 42-drawing streak without a jackpot winner. The winning ticketholders can choose between a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million or $893.5 million spread out over 30 annual payments. The odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 24.9. The odds were not in their favor, but these two ticket holders will now share a massive jackpot.</p>

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, called "The Road to Us Tour," which will span 50 cities. Cassidy, the son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, rose to fame in the 1970s as a pop star and actor, but stepped away from the spotlight to focus on writing and producing for television. In preparation for the tour, Cassidy has been relearning his old hits and taking guitar lessons, opting to play bass instead of guitar. He expresses that the songs feel new to him, and he feels he can sing better now than when he was 20 because he has not burned out his voice.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at a town hall in Brooklyn to address the threat of oligarchic control in the U.S. Mamdani, endorsed by progressive figures, advocates for rent freezes, increased housing, and higher taxes for the wealthiest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign, emphasizing its contrast to billionaire-backed campaigns. The event highlighted divisions within the Democratic party, as Sanders noted the muted support from mainstream Democrats for Mamdani. The two addressed concerns about potential deployment of national guard troops to New York City and the need to mobilize voters.</p>

          <p>Jayden Maiava led the USC offense to a decisive 59-20 victory over Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern team, accumulating 755 yards, the most for USC in two decades. Maiava threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns, while the Trojans also rushed for 309 yards. The game marked a reunion with former USC coach Clay Helton, who was met with boos from the Coliseum crowd. Despite a sloppy start, the USC offense quickly gained momentum, showcasing its firepower and efficiency. USC's defense had some breakdowns, but the offense's dominance made it a non-factor.</p>

          <h2>US-China Team Uses Bubble-Popping Energy to Launch Robots</h2>

          <p>A US-China research team has developed a method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form vapor bubbles that collapse and release energy. This energy creates a force strong enough to launch the small jumpers 1.5 meters into the air. By controlling the light, scientists can manipulate the launch and even make the materials swim. This article highlights a novel approach to micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S. are implementing locked magnetic pouches as a solution to cellphone bans, with Yonkers School District purchasing Yondr pouches for 11,000 students.

While some students welcome the change, others have sought ways to bypass the system, raising questions about the effectiveness and cost of the pouches. Yondr CEO Graham Dugoni founded the company to create "phone-free spaces" and encourage people to experience life outside a digital realm.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is attempting to promote its lesser-known politicians, aiming to increase its presence in councils and parliaments. The party's conference provided an opportunity for hopefuls like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson to gain prominence. However, Nigel Farage remains the party's most recognizable figure, and the party may appoint new peers to key roles in the government. The party is actively seeking 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections, emphasizing a more rigorous selection process to avoid past scandals.</p>

Bennett believes women face unique challenges due to misconceptions about their military experiences and often avoid traditional veteran spaces. The network provides a supportive community for women to connect and share their experiences, addressing the isolation they may feel after leaving the Armed Forces.</p>
