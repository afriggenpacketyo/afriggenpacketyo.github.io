          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship with a stunningly dominant performance, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in a final that lasted just 57 minutes. The victory marked the first time a woman has won the Wimbledon final with a "double bagel" since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's composure and skill on a surface where she had not previously won a major. For the 24-year-old, this is her sixth Grand Slam title, maintaining her perfect record in major finals and solidifying her status as a versatile and formidable force in women's tennis.</p>

          <p>England hooker Jamie George has been called up to the British and Irish Lions squad as an injury replacement ahead of the first Test against Australia. The move comes after Luke Cowan-Dickie suffered a suspected concussion during a warm-up match, making him unlikely to be available for the game in Brisbane. In another blow to the team, centre Garry Ringrose has been officially ruled out of the first Test due to his own concussion. George, a two-time Lions tourist, will join the squad in Brisbane, providing crucial experience to the team as it navigates these key injuries.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has agreed to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons smuggling charges. Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured last month after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a nationwide wave of violence, including riots and kidnappings. During a virtual court hearing, he consented to the extradition, a process that will now proceed once signed by President Daniel Noboa. This marks a significant step in Ecuador's war against powerful drug cartels with ties to international crime syndicates.</p>

          <p>An analysis has identified the U.S. states with the strongest economies, best prepared to navigate a potential recession or economic slowdown. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina lead the rankings, which evaluate states based on GDP and job growth, fiscal health, and the number of major corporate headquarters. The study also uniquely considers each state's dependency on federal spending and its vulnerability to international trade wars, providing a comprehensive look at economic stability in an uncertain climate. States with diverse economies and less reliance on volatile sectors are seen as having the greatest resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariffs and trade uncertainty, U.S. companies are increasingly using Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to manage costs. These customs-sanctioned areas allow businesses to import components and raw materials duty-free, with taxes only being collected when the final product enters U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow by delaying duty payments and allows products to be re-exported without incurring U.S. tariffs at all. While recent executive orders have eliminated some benefits like the "inverted tariff," these zones remain a critical tool for businesses navigating the complex global trade landscape.

Over a decade, his focus on a quality product and a slow, deliberate growth strategy has paid off, with the brand now sold in over 8,000 stores and on track to generate $50 million in revenue this year. Kirby has maintained control by avoiding outside investors, focusing on profitability and a long-term vision to become the top brand in the category.</p>

          <p>After years of debate, new online safety rules are set to be enforced in the UK, legally requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The regulator, Ofcom, will mandate that platforms implement age verification systems, with the potential for heavy fines for non-compliance. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules may already be outdated, as they do not fully address risks from AI chatbots, peer-to-peer messaging, or misinformation. The conversation is already shifting toward future regulations focused on addictive algorithms and healthy online habits.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. invests billions more in its Artemis moon program, China is rapidly advancing its own deep-space ambitions, posing a significant challenge to American leadership in space. China aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development and testing stages. While NASA's timeline for a crewed landing is officially earlier, it faces significant technical hurdles, such as the unprecedented need for in-orbit refueling for its lander.

          <p>This article offers a personal reflection on the current social and political climate for transgender people, contrasting the supposed 2014 "transgender tipping point" with today's legislative backlash. The author, a trans woman who transitioned as an adult, argues against the idea that the rise in trans-identifying youth is a fad, drawing parallels to the increased visibility of gay teens once social acceptance grew. Using the concept of survivorship bias, she contends that while she eventually found happiness, forcing children to wait for gender-affirming care can cause needless suffering, and that social acceptance is key to allowing youth to explore their identities safely.</p>

          <p>According to a negotiation expert, securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely a process that unfolds over several weeks. The article advises that the initial conversation with a manager should aim to start the dialogue, not to finalize a deal. It is crucial to get the timing right, such as during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review when budgets are already set. The expert stresses the importance of patience, follow-up, and clear documentation to hold both parties accountable and move the negotiation forward collaboratively.</p>
