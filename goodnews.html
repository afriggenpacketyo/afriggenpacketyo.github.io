In a notable early move, he convened a meeting with all club staff, from players to catering and cleaning crews, to emphasize that everyone is part of the collective journey. Known for his hands-on coaching style, Frank is more directly involved in daily training sessions than his predecessor and demands open communication and honesty from his team.

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to new estimates from policy experts. This projected increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment provided in 2025, offering modest relief against rising prices. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on inflation data from July, August, and September, with the final figure typically announced in October. The estimate reflects the ongoing impact of inflation on the financial well-being of retirees and other beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows 44% of registered voters backing Mamdani, with Cuomo at 25% and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams at just 7%, both running as independents. Mamdani's support is particularly strong among younger voters, though Cuomo leads with Black and Jewish voters. Meanwhile, leading Democrats have yet to endorse Mamdani, highlighting ongoing divisions within the party as the November election approaches.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed rates and flexibility. Calculations show that for shorter terms, such as three months, a high-yield savings account might currently earn slightly more due to higher variable rates. However, for longer terms of six months or a year, a CD with a fixed rate can provide a higher, more predictable return. Savers must weigh the security of a locked-in CD rate against the potentially higher but variable returns of a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote wilderness of British Columbia, Canada. Andrew Barber survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a makeshift shelter from sticks and moss. Displaying notable survival skills, he carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud to attract attention. A search and rescue helicopter spotted his truck, which led them to find him three miles away, severely dehydrated and with a leg injury, but alive.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges, the strong revenue and positive market sentiment reflect growing interest in stablecoins from financial institutions.

The proposal aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by shifting from importing fully assembled products to local manufacturing, branding them "Made in Paraguay." Ministers argue that current global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods, present an opportunity for Paraguay to become an attractive assembly hub. This economic strategy is being debated as Paraguay considers its diplomatic ties with Taiwan versus mainland China. (not investment advice)</p>
