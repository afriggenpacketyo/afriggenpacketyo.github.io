          <p>Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has officially endorsed Republican Matt Van Epps for the U.S. House seat being vacated by former Representative Mark Green. The endorsement comes less than a week before a competitive primary featuring a field of 11 Republican candidates. Van Epps, a West Point graduate and decorated combat pilot, previously served in Lee's cabinet and has also been endorsed by his predecessor, Mark Green. Lee praised Van Epps as a strong conservative who will support President Trump's agenda and bring results-driven leadership to Congress.</p>

          <p>Car rental company Hertz is significantly upgrading its online retail presence by allowing customers to complete the entire car buying process, from securing financing to getting a trade-in offer, through its website. This move is a key part of the company's strategy to make direct retail its primary channel for selling its used vehicles, which could improve resale values and accelerate fleet turnover. Previously, the website only listed vehicles, with the purchasing process happening at physical locations. The company is launching a new ad campaign with Tom Brady to promote the e-commerce platform as part of its ongoing business turnaround.</p>

          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins stated her support for the recent interest rate cut but urged caution regarding further easing of monetary policy. Speaking in New York, she highlighted the persistent risks of inflation alongside a potentially softening labor market, creating a highly uncertain economic environment. While acknowledging that further rate cuts may be appropriate this year, Collins emphasized that any future decisions must be guided by incoming data. Her remarks reflect the central bank's delicate balancing act of managing price stability without triggering significant job losses. (not investment advice)</p>

After his previous SPAC deals resulted in poor returns for many retail investors, Palihapitiya states this new vehicle is structured differently, with 98.7% of the allocation going to large institutional investors to temper retail fervor. The SPAC, which will target companies in AI, energy, and defense, carries no warrants, and Palihapitiya's compensation is tied to significant share price growth after a deal is made.

          <p>Google is updating its AI-powered search experience, known as AI Mode, to include visual results generated by artificial intelligence. Launched in May as a primarily text-based tool, AI Mode will now be able to produce images in response to queries, particularly those seeking inspiration for shopping or creative projects. For example, a user can ask for decor ideas and receive a series of generated images, which can then be refined with follow-up prompts. This move is part of Google's ongoing effort to integrate generative AI into its core search product and keep pace with competitors like OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Ruwa Romman, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to state office in Georgia, has announced her candidacy for governor. The 32-year-old Democratic state representative aims to build a progressive movement focused on economic issues like healthcare access, the minimum wage, and education funding. Romman gained national attention last year as a prominent voice in the "Uncommitted" voter movement, which expressed discontent with the Biden administration's policies on the war in Gaza. She now enters a crowded Democratic primary field, hoping to rebuild a coalition that includes young progressives and older, more cynical voters.</p>

          <p>According to the 2025 Triennial Central Bank Survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Chinese yuan has increased its share of global foreign exchange trading to 8.5%, up from 7% in 2022. The currency maintained its position as the fifth-most traded globally, continuing an upward trend that reflects Beijing's efforts to promote its international use in trade and finance. This push for greater yuan adoption is seen as a strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, which, according to the same survey, has slightly increased its own dominance in the forex market.

          <p>AI chipmaker Cerebras, a key competitor to Nvidia, has raised $1.1 billion in a new funding round, doubling its valuation to $8.1 billion. The company, which filed to go public a year ago but has not yet done so, designs powerful chips for training and running large artificial intelligence models. This substantial new investment provides Cerebras with more time and capital to stay private while expanding its U.S. manufacturing capacity. The funding comes as the demand for AI-specific hardware continues to surge, with investors eager to back companies challenging Nvidia's market dominance.</p>

          <p>Food delivery giant DoorDash has introduced its first standalone delivery robot, named Dot, designed to navigate sidewalks, parking lots, and streets. The autonomous vehicle can travel up to 20 miles per hour and carry up to 30 pounds, marking a significant step in the company's push into automation. According to DoorDash, developing its own robot was necessary as no existing technology fit its complex use case for local merchants. The company is currently testing Dot in Phoenix and plans to expand to other cities, joining competitors like Uber in exploring autonomous delivery solutions.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has identified 16 major U.S. cities where housing costs consume the smallest portion of residents' income. The study, using Census Bureau data, found that nationally, housing costs equaled about 21% of the median household income in 2024, but this figure rises to 25% in the 50 largest cities. The analysis provides a comparative look at affordability by measuring local incomes against a weighted average of renter and homeowner costs. The findings highlight cities that stand out for being more financially manageable, even as rising housing costs remain a significant strain for many Americans nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

Kohl, who passed away in 2017, is celebrated for his diplomatic efforts, particularly in securing approval from the Allied powers of World War II.

The 20-point proposal includes a swift ceasefire, the release of all hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim Palestinian administration. The plan, presented alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has received public support from the Palestinian Authority and a joint statement of welcome from several key Muslim-majority nations.
