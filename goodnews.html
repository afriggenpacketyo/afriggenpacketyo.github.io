          <p>Washington D.C. is preparing for a military parade honoring the Army's 250th birthday and President Trump's 79th birthday, with heightened security measures in place. Over 18 miles of fencing and 175 magnetometers will be deployed, and the entire district will be a no-fly zone for drones. Officials anticipate a large turnout, potentially hundreds of thousands of people, and are preparing for traffic impacts and possible civil disobedience. The military parade has been designated a National Special Security Event, prompting enhanced coordination among various law enforcement agencies. The article also notes that multiple counter-protests are planned, and officials are on alert for potential clashes.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England suggests teachers can use AI to reduce time spent on marking and administrative tasks. The training materials suggest AI can help automate routine tasks, freeing up time for face-to-face teaching. Teachers are advised to be transparent about AI usage and always verify results. The Association of School and College Leaders acknowledges the potential time-saving benefits but emphasizes unresolved issues. The article indicates that while AI should only be used for low-stakes marking, teachers can use AI to write routine letters to parents.</p>
