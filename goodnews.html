          <p>Voters in South Texas have approved the incorporation of SpaceX's launch facility into a new city named Starbase. The vote, largely supported by SpaceX employees, formalizes the area as a city, granting it control over local governance. While SpaceX officials state this move is to foster community growth and streamline launch operations by potentially closing Boca Chica Beach, critics worry about Elon Musk's increased control over the area and environmental impact. The city's creation coincides with SpaceX's request to increase launch frequency, sparking debates over public access and environmental justice.</p>
