        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The war in Ukraine appears to be weakening Russia's geopolitical influence in former Soviet states, exemplified by a recent US-mediated peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia. This shift is further evidenced by tense Russia-Azerbaijan relations following a plane crash and Azerbaijan's strengthening ties with Turkey and Central Asian nations. Analysts suggest that Russia's preoccupation with Ukraine has created a "window of opportunity" for these countries to pursue more independent, multi-vector foreign policies, with China also increasing its regional influence. The article notes this change may accelerate as a new generation of post-Soviet leaders emerges.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is expected to experience a brief heatwave, with temperatures potentially reaching 30°C on the upcoming bank holiday Monday. This warm spell comes amidst one of the hottest summers on record, which has previously caused wildfires and led to hosepipe bans and concerns over a poor harvest. The pleasant weather is forecast to be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are predicted to bring cooler temperatures, wind, and rain starting from Tuesday. Travelers are advised of potential disruptions due to rail strikes and engineering works over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a deal valued at £60 million, including add-ons. The 27-year-old, who was also a primary target for rival club Tottenham, ultimately chose to rejoin Arsenal, where he began his youth career. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Eze as a powerful and exciting player who will add a new dimension to the team's attack. In a heartfelt message, Eze thanked Crystal Palace and its fans for their support throughout his time at the club, particularly during his recovery from a major Achilles injury.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chairman's Signal of Potential Rate Cuts Boosts Economically Sensitive Stocks</h2>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a significant rally, particularly in cyclical and non-tech stocks, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's indication of possible future interest rate cuts. His remarks at the Jackson Hole economic symposium spurred investor confidence, leading to gains in companies like DuPont and Home Depot, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq saw a weekly loss. The positive market reaction suggests that lower borrowing costs are perceived as more beneficial for economically sensitive sectors than for large tech firms, whose fortunes are more closely tied to the AI boom.

          <h2>Berlin Street Named After Racist Term Officially Renamed to Honor Black German Philosopher</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 11:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a prolonged legal battle, a street in central Berlin previously bearing a racist term for Black people has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanaian-born scholar who became the first African to earn a doctorate from a European university in 1734. Civil society groups have campaigned for decades to change the name, which has historical ties to the enslavement of Africans in 18th-century Prussia. The renaming, finalized on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, is viewed as a significant step in Germany's process of decolonization and acknowledging its colonial past.</p>

          <h2>Considerations for a Retiree Asked to Temporarily Return as a Consultant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 11:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An individual planning to retire faces a dilemma after their employer, who delayed hiring a replacement, asked them to stay on as a part-time consultant to train the new employee. Accepting the role has several financial implications to consider. If the retiree begins collecting Social Security benefits while working, their earnings could temporarily reduce their payments, though benefits are recalculated at full retirement age. Alternatively, delaying Social Security claims while earning consulting fees could increase future monthly benefits. The short-term work could also allow for additional contributions to retirement accounts and extended access to employer-provided health insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted for the 31st time since December, sending fountains of lava 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption is contained and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular display for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma accumulating in a lower chamber is periodically forced to the surface through narrow vents, creating the dramatic lava fountains. While the current pattern of episodic eruptions could continue, experts note it could also evolve into a more continuous lava flow, similar to past long-term eruptions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 09:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment in the United States, according to The Princeton Review. The ranking considers factors such as academics, financial aid, college costs, and post-graduation earnings. Georgia Tech's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields contributes to the high median salaries of its alumni. The report highlights that while sticker price is a factor, the ultimate value of a degree is also determined by a school's ability to prepare students for successful, high-earning careers.
