          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features to address concerns about the platform's impact on young users' mental health. The company began testing these features with select teens earlier this year and will now make them available to users of all ages. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" and turned on by default for users under 18, interrupting their "For You" feed with guided meditation exercises after 10 p.m. This initiative follows public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to children, posing risks including depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults, marking the first debate since significant changes were made. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments, including removing the need for a High Court judge's approval for each request. Instead, a panel of experts will oversee the process. MPs are given a free vote on the bill, which has divided Parliament. The government quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year. Dame Esther Rantzen, campaigning for assisted dying due to her terminal lung cancer, has accused opponents of being influenced by undeclared religious beliefs.</p>

          <p>This article details Cassie's journey to happiness with her husband, Alex Fine, after years of alleged abuse by her ex, Sean "Diddy" Combs. Cassie testified against Diddy in his sex trafficking trial, recounting alleged physical and sexual abuse, including sexual assault. The article highlights the support Fine has shown Cassie, particularly after surveillance video surfaced showing Diddy beating her in a hotel in 2016. Cassie regularly shares photos and videos on social media, showcasing her wholesome family life with Fine and their children. In November 2023, Cassie filed a lawsuit against Diddy, which was settled a day later for $20 million, spurring other alleged victims to come forward.</p>

Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and the UAE committed to a $1.4 trillion investment framework. The warm reception and mutual praise signified a stark difference in tone from visits by Biden administration officials.

Despite analysts viewing the conflict as closer to a draw, Pakistan's ability to hold its own against India has temporarily overshadowed its political, economic, and security crises. General Syed Asim Munir, the army chief, has seen his public image rehabilitated, with billboards portraying him as a "national savior." However, challenges remain, including internal security threats and the need for effective counterterrorism strategies.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by affluent consumers' continued spending on jewelry. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, led by double-digit growth in the Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Full-year sales rose 4% to 21.4 billion euros. Despite global uncertainties, Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert highlighted the company's robust performance and the need for agility and discipline. BofA Global Research noted potential headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but believes the company's pricing power could provide a tailwind.</p>

The study found that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. It also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. The work, led by researchers at the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>
