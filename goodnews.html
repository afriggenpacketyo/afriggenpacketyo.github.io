          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump is successfully defeating the "liberal media" and achieving significant policy goals during his second term. The author points to the defunding of NPR and PBS, staff departures at The Washington Post, and legal settlements with news outlets as evidence of Trump's triumph over his media adversaries. The piece also credits his administration with securing the border, strengthening the economy through strategic tariffs, and decisively supporting Israel. The author contends that these successes, particularly in challenging established media narratives, represent a major victory for conservative principles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Writer Suleika Jaouad, author of "The Book of Alchemy," advocates for daily journaling as a tool for personal transformation and creative inspiration. Having used journaling to navigate her own health crises, she explains how the practice can help individuals make sense of their experiences and process difficult emotions. Jaouad suggests reading passages from other writers' diaries to gain new perspectives and overcome writer's block. For those new to journaling, she recommends setting a consistent time, integrating it into an existing routine like a morning coffee, and keeping the barrier to entry low by using any available medium, including a phone's notes app.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two changes to his starting lineup for the final Test against the Wallabies in Sydney, as the team aims for a historic 3-0 series whitewash. Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing, and James Ryan comes in at lock, joining eight other Irish players in the starting fifteen. The selection prioritizes cohesion over sentiment, with eleven players having started all three Tests. A victory would make them the first Lions team to win three consecutive tests since 1974 and the first to complete a clean sweep since 1927.</p>

          <p>A new Microsoft report suggests that blue-collar and manual labor jobs are among the safest from being replaced by generative artificial intelligence. Researchers analyzed user interactions with the Bing Copilot chatbot and found that AI was most effective at tasks like information gathering and writing, putting professions like translators and writers at higher risk. In contrast, jobs requiring physical work, such as painters, nursing assistants, massage therapists, and automotive repairers, had the lowest interaction with and potential impact from AI. The findings suggest that while white-collar roles face significant transformation, many hands-on professions currently exhibit more stability against AI disruption.</p>

          <p>This article profiles American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson and his critical role as a domestique, or support rider, for the Visma Lease-a-Bike team during the Tour de France. Despite battling bronchitis, Jorgenson dedicated his efforts to supporting team leader Jonas Vingegaard's ultimately unsuccessful bid against the dominant Tadej Pogačar. The piece highlights the selfless and often painful nature of a domestique's job, where personal ambitions are sacrificed for the team's strategy. Jorgenson's persistence ultimately paid off by helping teammate Wout van Aert secure a final stage win, demonstrating the profound impact of his sacrificial efforts even when the primary goal was unattainable.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have finalized a trade agreement that includes a partnership to develop Pakistan's oil reserves and provides lower tariffs on its exports to the US. President Donald Trump announced the deal, stating that an American oil company will be chosen to lead the development of what he described as Pakistan's "massive Oil Reserves." The agreement averts a potential 29% tariff on Pakistani goods. The announcement came shortly after the US imposed a 25% tariff on India, with Trump criticizing India's own high tariffs and its trade with Russia, suggesting Pakistan might one day sell oil to India.

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are expressing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Boeing and Airbus aircraft. According to Malaysia's Transport Minister, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery wait times from the two dominant manufacturers, is driving this interest. China is actively promoting its C919, manufactured by Comac, as a more readily available and cheaper option for narrowbody airliners. This potential diversification of aircraft procurement could mark a significant shift in the regional aviation market if deals are confirmed.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has facilitated the return of the sacred Piprahwa Gems, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India following intense pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders. The jewels, unearthed in 1898, were set to be auctioned in Hong Kong before the sale was canceled. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics and will now place them on permanent public display in India. The planned auction had sparked a significant ethical debate over whether sacred artifacts, especially those associated with human remains, should be treated as commercial commodities available for sale.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% after the U.S. and South Korea finalized a trade deal setting a 15% tariff on Seoul's exports. The company is expected to benefit from the agreement by expanding its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard, which it acquired last year, contributing to the revitalization of American shipbuilding. The stock's rise was also fueled by a 43.6% quarterly jump in operating profits and the announcement of new orders. This development highlights the direct impact of international trade policy on the financial performance and strategic plans of major industrial corporations. (not investment advice)</p>
