          <p>Shares of the trading platform Robinhood reached a record high, closing near $100 after a significant rally of over 30% since it was not included in the S&P 500 index.

          <p>A small preliminary study suggests that GLP-1 drugs, widely known for treating diabetes and promoting weight loss, may also be effective in reducing migraines. In the trial, participants receiving daily injections of liraglutide, an earlier GLP-1 medication, experienced a nearly 50% reduction in the number of migraine days per month. The positive effects appeared independent of weight loss, as participants' weight remained stable throughout the 12-week study. While the findings are promising, researchers emphasize the need for larger, controlled trials to confirm the drug's efficacy and explore its mechanism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, which will set a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the United States. The agreement also imposes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at curbing the circumvention of duties, particularly from China. In exchange, the deal grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnamese markets, which Trump highlighted in his announcement. This agreement comes ahead of a looming deadline for the expiration of a temporary pause on broader "reciprocal" tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a key Trump administration immigration policy that aimed to severely limit access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, issued on his first day in office, overstepped executive authority and that immigration law does not grant the president power to unilaterally supplant the existing asylum process. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda. The judge has delayed the order's effective date for 14 days to allow the government time to appeal the decision.</p>

Tarvet's journey through qualifying and the first round captured the attention of fans and earned him significant prize money, though college rules limit what he can accept. Alcaraz praised his opponent's performance, highlighting the difficulty of playing on Centre Court for the first time against a top-seeded player.</p>

The project uses the toad's struggle for survival as an allegory for the challenges facing Puerto Rico, such as gentrification, displacement, and cultural erosion. The film depicts a surreal, quieted version of the island where local culture is fading, resonating with audiences facing similar issues globally. By championing the toad and traditional music, the project suggests that cultural pride and expression are powerful forms of resistance against displacement.</p>

Industry leaders and unions have praised the legislation as a vital step to stimulate Hollywood's economy, which has slowed due to strikes, studio spending cuts, and other recent challenges.

Borrowers may also face closing costs similar to a mortgage and early termination penalties if the credit line is closed within the first few years.

The administration had planned to end the program for Haitians in September, well before its previously scheduled expiration in 2026. However, the judge determined that the Secretary of Homeland Security lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official end date.

This target is designed to keep the bloc on track for its 2050 net-zero goal and provide certainty for industrial investment. However, the proposal faces resistance from some member states who find it too ambitious. It also includes a controversial flexibility clause allowing countries to use international carbon credits to offset a small portion of their emissions, a measure that climate activists argue undermines domestic climate action.</p>
