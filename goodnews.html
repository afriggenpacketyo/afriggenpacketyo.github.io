        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food firms are increasingly trying to reduce the number of ingredients in their products, driven by growing consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers and brands are responding to demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists, with some seeing a significant increase in inquiries about low-ingredient products. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on reducing ingredients can lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients, potentially impacting public health. The trend reflects a broader debate about the definition and health implications of processed foods, with experts emphasizing the importance of nutrition over the degree of processing. The industry is adapting to evolving consumer preferences. </p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices declined slightly in May from their April peak, driven by consumer fears of tariff-related price increases, but remain elevated compared to last year. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index decreased 1.5% from April to May, but is still 4% higher than a year ago. Demand remains strong due to low inventory levels caused by consumers holding onto their vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years. While tariffs on new imported vehicles don't directly impact used car sales, they influence the used car market by affecting new vehicle prices, production, and demand. The article indicates a slight easing of pressure on consumers in the used car market. </p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules requiring UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. The measures would also necessitate full capitalization of UBS's foreign units and potentially reduce share buybacks. UBS shares increased by 6% following the announcement. Analysts suggest that the news represents the worst-case scenario for UBS, which can now lobby for concessions and mitigate the impact. The measures aim to strengthen UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of government bailouts in future crises. (not investment advice) </p>
