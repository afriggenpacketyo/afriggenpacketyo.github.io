          <p>Netflix stock has been trading at all-time-high levels, marking an unprecedented 11-day winning streak, fueled by a strong first-quarter earnings report that showed 13% revenue growth. Despite market volatility caused by President Trump's trade policies, Netflix shares have surged over 30% since mid-January, remaining largely unaffected by tariffs. Traditional media stocks like Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney have struggled during the same period, while Netflix forecasts full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion. JPMorgan analysts see further upside for the stock, citing Netflix's leadership in global streaming and the upcoming Advertising Upfronts as potential catalysts.</p>

          <p>DuPont's shares rose after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by double-digit growth in its electronics business, even as investors remain somewhat cautious due to tariffs and China exposure. The company's net sales increased by 4.6% year-over-year to $3.06 billion, and adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.03, surpassing estimates. DuPont is preparing to separate into two publicly traded companies, with the electronics business becoming Qnity on November 1st, an event expected to unlock value for shareholders. Management is working to mitigate tariff exposure, and China is considering ways to address concerns about fentanyl entering the U.S. as a way to start trade talks.</p>

          <p>Seasonal allergies are in full swing, with experts noting that warmer temperatures and changing weather patterns are causing plants to release pollen earlier and for longer periods. Common symptoms include itchy eyes, sneezing, and nasal congestion, but without fever or body aches. To manage allergies, doctors recommend limiting exposure by keeping windows closed, showering at night, and using over-the-counter antihistamines or nasal sprays. If symptoms persist or interfere with daily life, seeking professional medical advice for prescription options or immunotherapy is advised.</p>

          <h2>Key Questions to Consider Before Pursuing Debt Forgiveness</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before pursuing debt forgiveness, it's important to assess qualifications, explore alternative debt relief options, and determine if expert help is needed. Debt forgiveness typically requires significant financial hardship and is best suited for unsecured debts like credit cards. Alternatives include debt management plans, debt consolidation, or bankruptcy, depending on individual circumstances. Engaging a debt relief company can aid in negotiations but comes with fees, so borrowers must weigh the potential savings against the cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April, adding 177,000 jobs with an unemployment rate of 4.2%, despite the onset of President Trump's trade war, according to the Labor Department. While this data is backward-looking, it reassured investors worried about a potential trade-induced economic slowdown. However, analysts caution that the full impact of tariffs on the labor market will be felt in the coming months, with some companies already pulling forecasts for the year. The article notes that consumer sentiment has declined, and forecasters have increased the risk of recession and higher inflation, highlighting the uncertainties ahead.</p>
