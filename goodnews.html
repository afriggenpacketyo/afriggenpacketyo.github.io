        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill, titled the "Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2025," has been introduced by Rep. Aaron Bean to prevent disruptions to air travel during the ongoing government shutdown. The legislation seeks to ensure that essential Federal Aviation Administration personnel, including air traffic controllers, continue to receive pay. By temporarily using funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, the bill aims to avert flight delays and safety concerns that arose during previous shutdowns when essential workers went unpaid. This measure is presented as a way to shield the nation's aviation system from political gridlock.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent declines in mortgage rates have created significant savings opportunities for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For a $700,000 mortgage, the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% results in a monthly payment of $4,351, which is about $273 less per month compared to the 6.93% rates seen in January. This difference translates to over $3,200 in annual savings and nearly $100,000 in total interest saved over the life of the loan. The article provides a detailed breakdown of potential payments for both new loans and refinancing options, highlighting the financial benefits of the current rate environment.

          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a new pricing model that will allow mortgage lenders to license its scores directly, bypassing credit bureaus. This change, which aims to eliminate unnecessary markups, caused Fair Isaac's stock to rally over 20%, while shares of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax fell sharply. The move is seen as a significant disruption to the credit scoring industry, giving lenders more choice and potentially lowering costs. Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte praised the decision as a creative solution to make markets more competitive for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, reporting 497,099 units. The sales surge was partly driven by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired. Despite the quarterly growth, the company's year-to-date deliveries are down approximately 6% compared to the previous year, hampered by a sales slump in Europe amid increased competition and backlash against CEO Elon Musk. The company's energy storage business saw significant growth, deploying 12.5 GWh of its products during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile of $344 billion. Occidental Petroleum plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to pay down its debt, a move its CEO, Vicki Hollub, says will enable the company to restart its stock buyback program. Berkshire Hathaway is already a major shareholder in Occidental, holding a 28.2% stake in the Houston-based oil company.</p>

While a tropical storm warning remains in effect, the worst conditions have passed as the system moves farther into the Atlantic Ocean. There were no immediate reports of major damage. However, swells generated by Imelda and the remnants of Hurricane Humberto are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast for the next few days.</p>

With current rates around 4.30%, a deposit of $10,000 could earn approximately $212 in guaranteed interest by the time it matures next April. The article provides calculations for various deposit amounts, highlighting that CDs offer fixed rates and FDIC insurance, protecting both principal and earnings. This makes them a stable alternative to high-yield savings accounts, whose variable rates may decrease with anticipated Federal Reserve cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

This object, named Cha 1107-7626, is exhibiting an accretion episode far stronger than any previously recorded for a planetary-mass object, blurring the lines between how planets and stars form. The discovery suggests that some large, planet-like objects may form in a star-like manner from collapsing gas clouds. This finding provides new insights into the early, nascent stages of planetary and stellar development in the universe.</p>

          <p>With the average interest rate for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) dropping below 8%, homeowners have a more affordable option for borrowing large sums. For a $70,000 HELOC, the current average rate of 7.88% would result in a monthly payment of about $845 for a 10-year repayment period. This is a notable decrease from last year when higher rates would have made the same loan more expensive. Because HELOCs have variable rates, homeowners can benefit automatically from market-wide rate cuts without needing to refinance, making it an attractive option in the current economic climate.
