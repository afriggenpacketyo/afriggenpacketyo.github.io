          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider raising taxes before the Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures such as increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the memo, suggesting it confirms Labour's inclination towards raising taxes, while Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan expressed concerns about welfare cuts announced at the Spring Statement.
