          <p>President Trump reiterated his commitment to achieving a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, acknowledging that while both President Putin and President Zelenskyy are not yet prepared for direct negotiations, he anticipates a breakthrough. He detailed his diplomatic approach, which involves bringing warring leaders into a room to broker agreements with his guidance, a method he credits with resolving several other conflicts this year. Despite some foreign policy analysts questioning the impact of his past peace claims, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to ultimately facilitate a resolution. He emphasized his focus on saving lives rather than seeking accolades like the Nobel Peace Prize, underscoring his persistent efforts amidst ongoing hostilities.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally saw gains on Thursday, mirroring a tech-driven rally on Wall Street, despite broader economic anxieties. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed, boosted by tech giants like SoftBank Group and Nvidia supplier Advantest, although Nidec Corp shares plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also rose on positive household spending data, while South Korea's Kospi edged higher. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated amidst volatile trading. Global bond markets remain under pressure, with U.S. and Japanese long-dated yields rising due to tariff uncertainty and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Martha's Rule, an initiative allowing families to seek an urgent second medical opinion for deteriorating loved ones, has been fully rolled out to all acute hospitals in England. Piloted since April 2024, the telephone helpline has received nearly 5,000 calls, leading to 241 potentially life-saving interventions. The rule, championed by the parents of Martha Mills who died due to care failings, aims to foster a more equitable doctor-patient relationship and ensure concerns are heard. Martha's mother welcomed the expansion, advocating for its implementation across the entire UK and in maternity care, citing its proven impact on patient safety.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, establishing it as the third-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. This massive sum follows Wednesday's drawing, which saw no winning tickets for the $1.4 billion grand prize. The estimated cash value for Saturday's jackpot stands at $770.3 million before taxes. This current streak of 41 drawings without a winner ties the game's record for consecutive rollovers. A single winner could choose between an annuity, paid over 29 years with increasing annual payments, or a one-time lump sum, with the daunting odds of winning at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Experts have determined that the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, illegally felled in September 2023, was at least 100 to 120 years old. Historic England conducted a dendrochronological investigation, counting the growth rings in a cross-section of the trunk. The tree, formed by two fused stems, was believed to have been planted between 1860 and 1890 as a landscape feature on Hadrian's Wall. Two men were jailed for over four years for the act, which caused global outrage. Further detailed analysis using advanced imaging techniques is planned to refine the precise age, and the wood will be preserved in the National Wood Collection.</p>

Investors are also looking ahead to U.S. labor market data, including ADP private payrolls and jobless claims, which will influence the near-term outlook for the stock market, following a mixed close on Wall Street.

Judge Allison Burroughs blocked further federal funding stoppages and payment withholdings on existing grants, marking a significant legal victory for Harvard. The Trump administration had accused the college of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies, but the judge suggested this was a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack on universities.
