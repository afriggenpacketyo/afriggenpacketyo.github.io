          <p>China's long-term strategic planning, underpinned by political stability, is rapidly accelerating its green energy transition, positioning it as a leading "electrostate." The article highlights massive infrastructure projects, like ultra-high-voltage power lines, that efficiently transmit clean energy from production sites in the north and west to the populous east. This commitment aims for peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, significantly boosting renewable energy's share in total power generation capacity to about 60%. In contrast, the article notes US policy shifts towards fossil fuels, reflecting a divergence in global energy strategies.</p>

          <p>Investigators of the recent Louvre museum jewelry heist have recovered over 150 DNA, fingerprint, and other traces from items left behind by the four burglars, including a helmet, angle grinders, and gloves. The thieves, who made off with an estimated €88 million worth of jewels, initially struggled to open display cases but eventually succeeded by hand. Despite internal alarms functioning, museum staff retreated, possibly due to fear. Louvre director Laurence des Cars acknowledged security blind spots on the museum's outer walls, pledging upgrades to the CCTV network and advocating for a police station within the museum. Prosecutors express optimism that the extensive evidence will lead to arrests.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected revenue for its third quarter, indicating a recovery in demand for its PC processors, causing its stock to jump 6% in extended trading. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became Intel's top shareholder via an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration. The company also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate Intel CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. Intel's outlook for the fourth quarter aligns with analyst expectations, but the company noted potential revisions due to ongoing SEC approval for its unique accounting treatment of the government's stake, amidst the government shutdown.

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, initially set for Saturday, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech leaders. Mayor Lurie confirmed the decision, stating he informed the President of San Francisco's significant progress, including a nearly 30% citywide crime reduction and historic lows in violent crime and homicides. The mayor also discussed the fentanyl crisis with Attorney General Pam Bondi, receiving assurances of federal support. This reversal comes after initial controversy sparked by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's call for federal intervention, highlighting the city's united front on public safety.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have pledged financial support for Ukraine for 2026 and 2027, approving a 19th sanctions package against Russia, but deferred a concrete funding decision until December. The core of the debate revolves around leveraging hundreds of billions in frozen Central Bank of Russia assets to back a massive loan for Ukraine, with Belgium, a key holder of these funds, seeking more reassurances. While the commitment signals momentum, the vague wording suggests further legal and political wrangling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the urgency of receiving funds early in 2026, as he heads to London for a "Coalition of the Willing" meeting.</p>

In Utah, where debt approaches $4 million, individuals like DJ Bracken, who founded the Utah Lunch Debt Relief Foundation, and teacher Kati Jo Christensen, who raises funds through TikTok dances, are paying off school debts. While these acts of kindness are vital, advocates argue for systemic change, pushing lawmakers to broaden free lunch access nationwide. The article highlights that only nine states have permanently adopted free meal programs since the pandemic-era federal initiative ended in 2022, underscoring a critical need for policy reform to ensure basic nutrition for all children.</p>
