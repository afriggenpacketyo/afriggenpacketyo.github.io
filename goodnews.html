          <p>Leicester Tigers fought back in the second half to secure a crucial 44-34 victory over Sale Sharks in their bid for the Premiership play-offs. Sale Sharks initially dominated, leading 26-16 at halftime with four tries, but Leicester responded strongly after the interval with two tries from Ollie Hassell-Collins. Emeka Ilione's try appeared to seal the game, but Rob du Preez quickly responded for Sale, setting up a tense finish. Ilione's late try denied Sale a losing bonus point, securing the win for Leicester in this important match.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the immediate release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, from immigration custody on bail. Ozturk, a Turkish national, was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's actions. The judge stated that Ozturk's continued detention could chill the speech of millions of noncitizens and that there was no evidence she had engaged in violence or advocated violence. Tufts University expressed pleasure at the court's decision and looked forward to welcoming Ozturk back to campus.</p>
