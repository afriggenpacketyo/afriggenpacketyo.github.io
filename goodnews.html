          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, plans to distribute his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among the more than 100 children he has fathered. Durov, who is the "official father" of six children with three partners, has also donated sperm to a fertility clinic, resulting in over 100 additional children. He intends for his children to access their inheritance after 30 years, encouraging them to develop self-reliance and independence. Durov cited the risks associated with his work, particularly defending freedoms, as the reason for writing a will now, as he faces criminal charges in France which he has refuted. The charges relate to allegedly failing to properly moderate the app to reduce criminality, which he says is an absurd accusation. </p>

          <p>China has indicated its willingness to collaborate with the United States on combating fentanyl and repatriating illegal immigrants, two key priorities for the US government. Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong expressed this willingness during a meeting with US ambassador to China David Perdue, emphasizing the need for "mutual respect" from Washington. Wang stated that Beijing hopes the US can "meet China halfway" and contribute positively to the development of bilateral relations. Last year, several meetings were held to foster cooperation, and law enforcement agencies established anti-drug hotlines for information sharing.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists are increasingly critical of cities due to their liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies, often contrasting them with more conservative areas. Cities are seen as places where the future starts, challenging the populist focus on preserving the past. The shift of many cities towards the center-left has been a bitter defeat for the right, leading to caricatures of urban governments and a disregard for their political complexity. Despite the right's animosity, cities remain crucial economic hubs, and their resistance to intolerant populism serves as an act of defiance and encouragement.</p>

          <p>In China, AI-generated avatars have demonstrated their potential as highly effective influencers, surpassing the performance of real people in livestreaming sales. Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu used digital avatars based on Baidu's generative AI model to interact with viewers for over six hours. The livestreaming session generated 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales, significantly outperforming Luo's previous livestream attempt last month. The avatars were built using Baidu's AI model, which learned from five years of videos to mimic their jokes and style, highlighting the growing influence of AI in e-commerce.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 32C for a second consecutive day. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to be cautious with potential fire hazards. Scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change, with the chance of reaching 32C in June increasing significantly since the pre-industrial era.</p>

          <p>The Associated Press has released its predictions for the song of the summer in 2025 across various categories. Bad Bunny's "NUEVAYoL" is predicted to be the song of the summer that inexplicably came out in January, while PinkPantheress' "Tonight" is the song for those chronically online. Lorde's "What Was That" is anticipated to be the breakup song of the summer, and KATSEYE's "Gnarly" is the song for girls and those who love them. Young Miko's "WASSUP" is the song for singles ready to mingle, and Alex Warren's "Ordinary" is the British boy ballad interpreted by an American. The biggest song of the year, and therefore the song of the summer by default, is "Luther" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2¬Ω times. The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying rot in various fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes. The low-cost coating is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity. This strategy offers a promising solution to reduce global food waste, with a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit.</p>
