          <p>A US marshal was mistakenly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Arizona after being misidentified as a subject they were seeking. The deputy marshal matched the general description of the suspect and was detained at a federal building in Tucson.

          <p>England captain Harry Kane admitted that his team "got away with it" in their 1-0 win against Andorra, acknowledging that their performance was "wasn't good enough." The team faced boos from some fans at half-time and full-time, with manager Thomas Tuchel noting a lack of seriousness and urgency. Kane, despite scoring the winning goal, emphasized the need for analysis and improvement, especially considering the conditions expected at the 2026 World Cup. He cited a lack of quality and fatigue as contributing factors to the subpar performance.</p>

          <p>The government is considering introducing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, including a potential two-hour cap and a 22:00 curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said he was looking at the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones. An online safety campaigner, Ian Russell, whose daughter took her own life after seeing harmful content online, criticized the government for delaying new laws to protect children. Kyle noted that new legislation passed in 2023 had yet to be enacted, which he says has prevented him from acting sooner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, tone of voice or attitude is the most common reason couples fight, as it signals contempt, a predictor of divorce. Other frequent sources of conflict include family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist suggests that couples resist striking back and instead name the effect, such as saying, "That felt condescending. Can we try again?" Open communication and addressing underlying needs are key to resolving these conflicts and strengthening the relationship.</p>
