          <p>Renowned author Jacqueline Wilson is releasing "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." The new novel revisits the characters Dolphin and Star as adults, exploring their ongoing struggles with their mother Marigold's bipolar disorder. Wilson describes the book as both the "easiest and the hardest" she's ever written, balancing her affection for the characters with the challenge of portraying their realistic, and often difficult, adult lives. She emphasizes her commitment to depicting truth, even when uncomfortable, a hallmark that has defined her career and resonated deeply with readers who saw their own families reflected in her work.</p>

          <p>China has emerged as a dominant force in the global electric vehicle market, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023 and challenging established automakers. Companies like BYD, which overtook Tesla as the top EV manufacturer by revenue, have benefited from substantial government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a strong battery supply chain. This rapid expansion has prompted regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and E.U., with both imposing tariffs to protect their domestic industries from alleged anti-competitive practices. Analysts predict China's influence will continue to grow, with exports projected to reach 9 million vehicles annually by 2030.</p>

The 2021 champion dominated the match with strong serving and powerful groundstrokes, completing the win in exactly one hour. Raducanu stated she is learning to better embrace the pressure and expectations that have followed her since her historic title run four years ago. Her next opponent will be former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. The win continues a positive run of form for Raducanu on the North American hard court circuit this season.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, China is asserting itself as a primary defender of the post-war international order, a role that contrasts with its frequent portrayal in the West as a revisionist power. Having suffered an estimated 35 million casualties as a key Allied nation, Beijing now leverages this history to legitimize its position on the global stage. This narrative is particularly significant as China faces criticism from Western nations, which often frame its growing influence as a challenge to the existing security architecture. The article examines how China's historical sacrifices underpin its contemporary diplomatic and geopolitical strategies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, projecting continued sales growth above 50% driven by sustained demand for its artificial intelligence technology. Despite the strong overall performance, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The results confirm Nvidia's central role in the global AI infrastructure boom, with overall revenue growing 56% year-over-year, though this marked the slowest growth in its recent high-demand period.

          <p>To mark the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's brutal murder, his family members and supporters are recreating the train journey he took from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955. The commemorative ride, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, includes Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., Till's cousin and the last living eyewitness to his kidnapping. The 14-year-old's lynching and his mother Mamie Till's decision to hold an open-casket funeral became a pivotal catalyst for the modern Civil Rights Movement. The event aims to honor his memory and legacy, with further programming scheduled upon arrival in Mississippi on the anniversary of his death.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla of California deflected questions about a potential 2026 gubernatorial campaign, stating his current focus is entirely on the upcoming November special election concerning the state's congressional districts. While he did not rule out a future run for governor, Padilla emphasized the immediate importance of the redistricting initiative, which aims to counter Republican-led efforts in other states to control Congress. He framed the issue as a defense against attempts to "rig the system" through gerrymandering. Padilla's name has recently emerged as a possible contender in the unsettled race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corporation have reached a short-term contract extension, narrowly avoiding a blackout of Fox channels for millions of subscribers.

The dispute centers on the fees YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, which includes the Fox broadcast network, FS1, and Fox News. While the temporary agreement keeps the channels on the air, both companies must continue negotiations to secure a new long-term deal.</p>

The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management confirmed the development, which follows lawsuits that had already halted the transfer of new detainees to the center. The facility had drawn scrutiny and was visited by President Donald Trump and top Homeland Security officials, with a projected cost of around $400 million.

          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and high interest rates, a record number of consumers are committing to monthly car payments of $1,000 or more, according to an analysis by Edmunds. The automotive resource identifies several critical mistakes buyers should avoid, including purchasing outside their means and relying solely on dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan. Other costly errors include trading in a vehicle with negative equity, which rolls debt into a new loan, and failing to negotiate with a dealership's internet sales team first. Experts also recommend considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid the steep depreciation of a new car.</p>
