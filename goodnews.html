          <p>In Bristol, England, street sex workers are partnering with police and a charity through the Night Light initiative to identify at-risk children and prosecute child sexual abuse offenders. The women provide vital information about child exploitation, leveraging their unique position as eyes and ears after dark. One woman's testimony led to the imprisonment of a man abusing his daughter, while another reported a man showing child abuse photos, leading to his arrest. The initiative, which began during COVID-19 lockdowns, has facilitated numerous conversations and reports, highlighting the women's crucial role in safeguarding vulnerable children and bringing perpetrators to justice.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in Britain is planning to reduce the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 in response to growing concerns about driver shortages and frequent service disruptions. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander believes this change will secure the railways' future and open up numerous job opportunities, attracting younger individuals to a skilled career. The average age of UK train drivers is currently 48, with a significant portion nearing retirement by 2029. The initiative aims to alleviate reliance on drivers working overtime and increase diversity within the workforce.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has given his first interview since leaving office, criticizing Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy and describing it as "modern-day appeasement," particularly regarding Ukraine.

He also addressed Trump's remarks about acquiring Greenland and potentially annexing Canada, stating that such behavior is not representative of American values. Biden defended his own record on Ukraine and his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Taoyuan as a "camp area," a move reflecting the island's ongoing reassessment of the former Kuomintang (KMT) leader's legacy. The mausoleum of Chiang's son and successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, has also been reclassified similarly. The two sites will no longer be referred to as "mausoleums" or "spirit-worship facilities." The military cited updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area as reasons for the change.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to support economic growth amid trade tensions. These steps aim to stimulate lending and boost liquidity in key sectors such as technology and real estate. The measures also include establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care, and reducing mortgage rates. However, some analysts suggest these measures may have limited impact on domestic credit demand, noting that borrowing has been somewhat insensitive to interest rates.</p>

          <p>Five prominent Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been residing at the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have left Venezuela and are now in the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced their arrival, attributing it to a "precise operation." The move comes as Venezuela seeks to appease the Trump administration, which has threatened to reimpose sanctions. These activists, who played a crucial role in organizing the opposition campaign, had sought asylum after facing arrest warrants, and their departure marks a significant development amid ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>In England and Wales, criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings may face an additional two years in prison under a new bill. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice, providing a moment of reckoning for victims' families. The proposed measures, prompted by cases where killers did not attend sentencing, are seen as a step in the right direction by victims' families. The bill also addresses disruptive behavior in court, allowing judges to punish offenders who disrupt proceedings.</p>
