          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his return to the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers, allowing one run in one inning against the San Diego Padres. This marked his first pitching appearance since undergoing elbow surgery in August 2023. Ohtani gave up singles to the first two batters before a sacrifice fly scored a run, but he managed to retire the next two batters. His fastball reached speeds of up to 100 miles per hour, and he is gradually increasing his workload after facing hitters in practice sessions. The game also marked his first time batting and pitching in the same game since his injury, showcasing his unique two-way abilities.</p>

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is expected to be commissioned soon, according to circulating social media images and state media hints.

          <p>The UK Parliament will debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies. Her amendment would maintain punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of the existing law. The current law states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy and beyond that in certain circumstances.</p>

Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) is calling on the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s.

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has warned that patients filming their medical treatment for TikTok or Instagram could put themselves and NHS staff at risk. Patients are increasingly videoing their procedures on mobile phones, often without asking permission, which can distract staff and compromise privacy. Sharing material on social media risks publicizing the private medical data of other people in the hospital. The union said another of its members, a department assistant from the south coast of England, was inserting a cannula as part of a cancer procedure, when the patient's 19-year old daughter started filming on her phone.</p>
