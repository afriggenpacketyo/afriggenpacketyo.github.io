          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her attempt to have her 2022 fraud conviction appeal reheard. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected her request, and no judge requested a vote for a full court rehearing. This decision means Holmes' last legal recourse is the Supreme Court. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison for defrauding investors about Theranos' blood-testing technology, which she claimed would revolutionize healthcare. The company collapsed after investigations revealed the technology's shortcomings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should understand the potential impact of minimum draw requirements on their borrowing costs. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, or both, potentially leading to unnecessary interest charges. These rules can affect repayment plans, especially with variable-rate HELOCs, and could result in payment shock during the repayment period. Homeowners should carefully review the terms and conditions of a HELOC to determine if it aligns with their borrowing needs.</p>

Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning, citing higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic.
