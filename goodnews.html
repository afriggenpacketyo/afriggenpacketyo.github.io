The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee performed her hits "Someone to Call My Lover" and "All For You." Jackson's career, spanning decades, includes numerous chart-topping songs and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, an honor seen as overdue. Her career faced challenges after the 2004 Super Bowl incident, for which she later received an apology from Justin Timberlake.</p>

          <p>Japan is experiencing a surge in craft gin production, with distillers using homegrown ingredients and local specialties to create unique flavors. Domestic shipments of gin have increased significantly, driven by the flexibility of gin production and the ability to utilize existing shochu and whiskey equipment. Distilleries across Japan are incorporating local botanicals like goya bitter gourd, burnt lacquer wood, and camellia flowers. This boom has led to the rise of gin-focused e-commerce sites and bars, with major manufacturers also entering the market.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's leading creditor for the first time in 34 years, surpassed by Germany, despite an increase in its net external assets. Japan's gross external assets rose to a record high due to a weaker yen, but Germany's total assets were higher. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan remains the second-largest holder of net external assets, followed by China.</p>

The decision was made following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump's initial threat to impose the tariff had caused market instability, but the delay has provided a window for potential trade resolutions. The EU and the U.S. are now expected to engage in swift talks to reach a mutually agreeable deal.</p>
