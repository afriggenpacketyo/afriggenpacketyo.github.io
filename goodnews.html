          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a "very good phone call" discussing trade issues, leading to an agreement for US and Chinese negotiating teams to meet soon at a location to be determined. Trump said the call, lasting about 90 minutes, focused on the intricacies of their recently agreed-upon trade deal and resulted in a positive conclusion for both countries. Xi Jinping extended an invitation to Trump and the First Lady to visit China, which Trump reciprocated, emphasizing the importance of this relationship between the two nations. The call occurred amidst a 90-day tariff truce initiated last month, during which the US reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with President Trump at the White House to discuss trade, tariffs, Russia's war in Ukraine, and tensions in the Middle East. This is their first in-person meeting since Merz became chancellor last month. Trade and tariffs are expected to be a primary focus, especially with Trump's 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union set to take effect on July 9, prompting the EU to prepare countermeasures. Merz emphasized the importance of the alliance between Germany and the United States for the security, freedom, and prosperity of Europe.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against at her job with the Ohio Department of Youth Services. The decision effectively lowers the burden of proof required for members of a majority group to make discrimination claims. Ames argued she was denied a promotion and then demoted because her employer favored LGBTQ staff members, but lower courts ruled she did not provide sufficient evidence. Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson wrote the unanimous opinion, stating that anti-discrimination laws should apply equally to all Americans, regardless of their identity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting entry from 12 countries, has been designed to avoid the legal challenges faced by his previous attempt. Legal experts note that the new ban is more legally robust, with wider scope and clearly defined exemptions.
