          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and varying consumer adoption rates of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume in 2024 to roughly 20% by 2030, with the potential for adjustments based on regulations and customer acceptance. Toyota's strategy reflects a cautious approach to electrification, balancing investments in all-electric vehicles with the practical appeal of PHEVs. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, emphasized the company's commitment to increasing the EV-only range of its PHEVs.</p>

          <p>Japan has celebrated the promotion of Onosato, a 24-year-old sumo wrestler, to the rank of yokozuna, marking the first Japanese competitor to achieve this honor in seven years. The sport has been dominated by Mongolian wrestlers in recent years, making Onosato's achievement a significant moment for Japanese sumo. Onosato, whose real name is Daiki Nakamura, expressed his determination to uphold the title of yokozuna and bring encouragement to Ishikawa prefecture, which was affected by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2024. His promotion sets up a rivalry with Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, the other wrestler holding the yokozuna title.</p>

          <p>Former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw has criticized the team's potential interest in acquiring Aaron Rodgers, deeming it "a joke." Bradshaw alluded to Rodgers's alternative beliefs, suggesting he should "chew on bark and whisper to the gods out there" instead. He also criticized the Steelers' treatment of Kenny Pickett, the quarterback they drafted in 2022 and later traded to the Philadelphia Eagles. Bradshaw argued that the Steelers failed to provide Pickett with adequate protection and offensive weapons, ultimately leading to his perceived failure.</p>

Judge Richard Leon criticized the order, which targeted the firm for hiring Robert Mueller, who oversaw the probe of possible coordination between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Leon emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, stating that the order would be unfaithful to the Founding Fathers. The judge's ruling reflects the ongoing legal battles surrounding Trump's actions and their impact on the legal system.</p>
