          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the ousting of former leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by district-based electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the difficulty of creating an accurate voter registry due to widespread displacement as the reason for this system. The results are being watched as an indicator of the new government's commitment to inclusivity for women and minorities.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though its path has not been a simple spending spree. The club has modernized its training facilities, more than doubled its staff, and seen revenues projected to climb past £400 million. On the field, the team has won a major domestic trophy and qualified for the Champions League twice, but progress has been gradual due to Profit and Sustainability Rules that limit spending. The article balances the club's growth with ongoing criticism regarding its ownership's human rights record.</p>

          <p>China is shifting its public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers and content creators to reshape its image for a younger audience. For the second year, the Chinese embassy in Kenya has funded trips for popular Kenyan influencers to visit China and create content showcasing its culture, scenery, and tourism. This move is seen by analysts as a "soft power" campaign aimed at connecting directly with Gen Z and Millennial Africans. The strategy moves beyond traditional state-led media to build a more personal and appealing brand on the continent.</p>
