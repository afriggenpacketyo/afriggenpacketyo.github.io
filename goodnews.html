          <p>China's Ministry of Transport forecasts a record 2.4 billion journeys will be made during the eight-day "golden week" holiday period, marking a 6.2% increase from the previous year. This surge in travel is being accommodated by a significant increase in services, with the national railway operator adding over 1,880 additional trains to manage the high demand. Popular routes, such as those connecting Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Beijing, are experiencing rapid ticket sales, indicating a robust rebound in domestic tourism and travel activity across the country.</p>

          <p>All 580 hikers and over 300 support personnel who were stranded on Mount Everest by severe snowstorms have been successfully rescued, according to Chinese state media. The groups were trapped at high altitudes after heavy snowfall during China's "Golden Week" holiday crushed tents and made trails impassable. Rescue operations brought the climbers and their guides to a secure location on the Tibetan Plateau for their return journeys. The severe weather also affected the neighboring Qinghai province, where one person reportedly died from hypothermia and altitude sickness.</p>

          <p>The Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger flag from the popular Japanese manga "One Piece" has been adopted as a symbol of resistance by youth-led protest movements worldwide. Initially gaining prominence in Indonesia as a sign of discontent against government policies, the flag has since appeared in demonstrations in Nepal, the Philippines, Kenya, and Madagascar. Experts suggest the symbol resonates with Gen Z activists because the series' protagonists stand for freedom, individual choice, and challenging corrupt authority. This follows a trend of pop culture symbols, like the Guy Fawkes mask, being used in real-world protests.</p>

          <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group has announced its agreement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion. This strategic acquisition is part of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision to advance "Physical AI," which aims to merge Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics. The deal allows SoftBank to deepen its investments in AI-related technologies, which already include chip designer Arm and a stake in OpenAI. For ABB, the sale provides immediate value to shareholders and shelves its previous plans to spin off the robotics unit as a separate publicly listed company.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined plans for a compensation scheme that could see lenders pay out £8.2 billion to millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal. The issue involves undisclosed commission arrangements that led to inflated interest rates on 14 million agreements between 2007 and 2024, with the average payout estimated at £700 per claim. FCA chief Nikhil Rathi stated it is time for customers to get fair compensation, though industry representatives have argued the regulator is "overcompensating." The scheme aims to provide a free and accessible redress process for affected car buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arattai, an Indian messaging app developed by Zoho, has experienced a massive surge in downloads, driven by a government push for citizens to use homegrown technology. The app, which offers features similar to WhatsApp, gained millions of new users after being promoted by federal ministers as part of a "make in India" campaign. Despite its sudden popularity, experts remain skeptical about its ability to challenge WhatsApp's dominance, which boasts 500 million active users in the country. Concerns have also been raised regarding data privacy, as the app does not yet offer end-to-end encryption for text messages.</p>

          <p>Everton's Jordan Pickford has solidified his position as England's undisputed number one goalkeeper, on the verge of breaking a seven-consecutive-clean-sheet record he shares with Gordon Banks. Despite early-career questions about his temperament, former teammates and pundits note his increased maturity and consistency for both club and country. The article highlights his exceptional long-range distribution and improved all-round play, making only one error leading to a goal in his 78 international appearances. With his proven performance in major tournaments, there is little debate that he remains the top choice for England heading into the World Cup.</p>

          <h2>New Kidney Transplant Method Using Blood Type Conversion Shows Promise</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated a new technique that could significantly expand the pool of available organs for kidney transplants by converting their blood type. The method uses enzymes to change the blood type of a donor kidney, which was then transplanted into a recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. Published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, this breakthrough offers hope for reducing long organ waiting lists and addressing inequities in organ allocation. The team noted that this approach could make more efficient use of the human organ pool while other solutions remain years away.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has clarified his decision-making regarding the use of relief pitcher Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS. Roberts initially used Blake Treinen in a save situation to give Sasaki, who recently returned from injury, an extra day of rest. The plan nearly backfired as Treinen allowed two runs, forcing Sasaki to enter the game to secure the final out anyway. Moving forward, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is the primary closing option but emphasized the team must carefully manage the workload of the young pitcher, who has never before pitched in a relief role.</p>
