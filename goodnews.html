          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:19:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert in parent-child relationships introduces 'emotionally safe parenting,' a framework focused on emotional attunement, resilience, and open communication. This style encourages parents to accept children's emotions without dismissal, respond without shame, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Key practices include self-reflection, empathetic boundary setting, and repairing disconnections after conflicts. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves and developing emotional resilience by creating a safe space during emotional storms. </p>

          <p>Alex Palou of Spain became the first Spaniard to win the Indianapolis 500, triumphing over Marcus Ericsson in a dramatic race filled with crashes and mechanical issues. The race was initially delayed by rain and then plagued by incidents including Scott McLaughlin crashing on the warm-up lap, a brake fire for Scott Dixon, and Marco Andretti crashing on the first lap. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete "the double" was cut short by a collision, while Josef Newgarden's bid for a third consecutive win ended due to a fuel pump issue.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola signed defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis in January which could spell the end for the injury-prone duo of John Stones and Nathan Ake. Goalkeeper Ederson was heavily-linked with a move to Saudi Arabia last summer and those rumours may resurface. Third-choice Scott Carson is out of contract this summer, while reports suggest midfielder Bernardo Silva wants a new challenge away from the Premier League. It will be an important period of transition off the pitch too.</p>

Ohtani threw 22 pitches to live hitters, reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball and using his full repertoire of throws. This was his first time throwing to live hitters in 19 months, and he is expected to return to the rotation sometime after the All-Star break.
