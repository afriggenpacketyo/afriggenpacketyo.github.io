        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a call from President Donald Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission will propose a rule change that could allow public companies to report earnings semi-annually instead of quarterly. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins stated that the proposal aims to let the market determine the appropriate reporting frequency, arguing it could encourage long-term business focus over short-term results. Supporters believe this change would save money and reduce pressure on corporate managers, while opponents express concern that less frequent reporting could harm transparency for investors. The rule change would be optional for companies and requires a majority vote from the SEC.</p>

The couple, who had lived in the country for decades running a charitable program, were freed and are set to undergo medical checks before returning to the UK. The Taliban, which never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention, stated they were released after judicial proceedings for breaking Afghan laws. Their family expressed immense relief and gratitude for the diplomatic efforts of the Qatari, UK, and US governments in securing their freedom.</p>

The report notes that while salary gains have slowed, workers are prioritizing stability, good company culture, and schedule flexibility.

          <h2>Minneapolis Fed President Advocates for Two Additional Rate Cuts in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 09:05:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has expressed support for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one approved by the Federal Open Market Committee this week. He argues that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs is likely a temporary, one-time effect, which provides room for more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari's dovish stance is based on his growing confidence that inflation expectations remain contained, alongside signs of an easing labor market and slowing wage growth. This perspective suggests a path toward further rate reductions to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high of 4.145%, even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive movement reflects investor sentiment that weighs long-term economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance alongside short-term rate expectations. Recent strong jobless claims data has eased concerns about a potential economic slowdown, contributing to the rise in longer-dated yields. Investors are now looking ahead to the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index for further insight into inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The guidance clarifies that the tax break, effective from 2025 to 2028, does not apply to workers in specified service fields like healthcare, legal, and financial services. Additionally, automatically included gratuities, such as mandatory service charges for large parties, will not qualify as deductible tips because they are not voluntary. The deduction phases out for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income exceeding $150,000.</p>

          <p>Yevgeny Savin, a former professional footballer and popular Russian YouTuber, has successfully rebuilt his football club, Krasava, in Cyprus after fleeing Russia due to his opposition to the war in Ukraine. After being charged in absentia for "discrediting" the Russian army, Savin re-established the team in Ypsonas, where it has now earned promotion to Cyprus's top division. The club has become a unifying force for the Russian-speaking immigrant community on the island, bringing together people from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Savin's story highlights the intersection of sports, politics, and personal conviction in the face of conflict.</p>

          <p>A group of 34 students from Gaza, all holding fully funded scholarships, have been evacuated from the conflict zone and are en route to the United Kingdom to attend university. This marks the first time since the conflict began that students have been officially assisted in leaving the Strip for educational purposes in the UK. The evacuation, supported by the British government, follows months of campaigning by academics and politicians. While this is a positive development for the evacuated students, advocates remain concerned for at least 35 other scholarship holders who are still awaiting evacuation from Gaza.</p>

The e-commerce giant plans to offer discounted dining vouchers through its Taobao Shangou and Ele.me platforms, a business model that directly challenges Meituan's core service. The initiative is set to launch in several major Chinese cities ahead of the national "golden week" holiday, a period of high consumer spending. This move signals a new front in the battle between the two tech conglomerates, which have been competing fiercely in the instant commerce and food delivery sectors.</p>

The procedure required special considerations due to his age but was successfully completed.
