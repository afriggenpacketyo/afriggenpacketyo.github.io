          <p>Two European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a wildlife park near Exeter, leading to an evacuation of the park. The bears headed straight for the honey store, consuming a week's worth of the sweet treat. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, were deployed, and police were notified, but the bears remained calm and did not breach any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of damage to the enclosure.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a bill to regulate digital assets, aiming to define when crypto is a commodity or security. The proposed legislation would allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce SEC regulation. It also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion, building on bipartisan momentum seen with the recent stablecoin bill passage. A Senate Banking Committee subcommittee hearing will discuss the bill, but its future remains uncertain due to differing House priorities.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced that senators will remain in Washington, D.C., until they pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which aims to fund much of President Donald Trump's domestic policy agenda. This decision overrides the planned recess for the week of July 4th, signaling the importance of passing the legislation before the deadline. The bill has undergone scrutiny by the Senate Parliamentarian for potential rule violations, a process known as the Byrd Bath, which is still underway. The goal is to have the bill on President Trump's desk by the Independence Day holiday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s unwavering commitment to the alliance, emphasizing President Donald Trump's support, while also highlighting the expectation for European and Canadian allies to increase defense spending. Rutte urged allies to focus on defense investment plans and support for Ukraine, dismissing concerns about the U.S.'s dedication. NATO members have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, although some countries are struggling to meet even the previous 2% target. Trump's attendance at the summit is seen as a sign of NATO's strength, despite his past criticisms of the alliance.</p>

          <p>Summer camp has become a significant part of American culture, with a $3.5 billion industry, despite not being attended by the majority of children. Early camps were created for urban middle-class boys to gain outdoor experiences, and the YMCA and other organizations expanded access to different groups. Camps play a role in teaching nostalgia for the American past and creating a sense of community and adventure. Over time, specialty camps have emerged to cater to specific interests, adapting to the changing needs and complexities of modern families.</p>

          <h2>The Value of Reading Fiction for Men</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reading fiction offers men an escape from the pressure to conform to societal expectations and provides a space for solitary contemplation and perspective. While arguments for reading often emphasize empathy, fiction can be valuable even when the characters are unsympathetic, as it allows readers to explore diverse experiences and perspectives. The act of reading is subversive, allowing for private thought and a break from the noise of the outside world, reminding readers that they exist along a continuum of human experiences. Fiction offers a heightened sense of perspective that can be more impactful than facts alone.</p>
