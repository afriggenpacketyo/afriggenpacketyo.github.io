          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he anticipates extending the August 12 deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods during upcoming negotiations in Stockholm. The talks, hosted by Sweden, aim to build on a 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs agreed upon in May. Bessent expressed optimism, hoping discussions will also cover China's manufacturing surplus and its support for Russia. This follows a period of intense trade conflict where both nations had imposed tariffs exceeding 100% on each other's imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Key Questions for Seniors Considering a Reverse Mortgage Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:10:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation and concerns about retirement funds, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity. This article advises homeowners aged 62 and older to ask critical questions before proceeding, such as whether it's the smartest way to borrow and if they can manage with existing funds. It also stresses the importance of considering the financial impact on beneficiaries, as the loan must be repaid upon the homeowner's death. Finally, it suggests evaluating which payment option—lump sum, monthly payments, or a line of credit—best suits their individual financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:01:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that he will not attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that Powell "is going to be out pretty soon anyway." This comment appears to de-escalate weeks of public attacks on Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. Despite his criticism, Trump seems willing to let Powell's term run its course until May 2026, a move that could calm financial markets concerned about a potential clash over the Fed's independence. The administration has also intensified pressure through other means, calling for a review of the Fed's operations and renovation project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), a prominent German think tank, recently completed a visit to Beijing, marking a significant development in diplomatic relations. Mikko Huotari and other Merics researchers had been sanctioned and unable to travel to China for four years. The trip, made at the invitation of a Chinese think tank, is being interpreted as a sign that Beijing may be easing these travel restrictions. The move is welcomed by European leaders who have consistently advocated for the removal of the sanctions to foster better engagement.</p>

          <h2>MIT Researchers Develop Bionic Knee for More Natural Movement in Amputees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:00:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have developed a groundbreaking bionic knee that allows above-the-knee amputees to walk more naturally. The system, called e-OPRA, involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic limb and integrates with muscle tissue. This direct connection bypasses the need for traditional, often uncomfortable sockets and allows the prosthesis to respond to the user's intent for smoother, more intuitive movement. While still in clinical trials, the technology represents a major breakthrough in restoring not just mobility but also a sense of body ownership for amputees.</p>

          <p>On-location entertainment production in the Los Angeles area decreased by 6.2% in the second quarter compared to last year, according to a report by FilmLA. The decline was driven by significant drops in feature film and commercial shoots, which fell by 21.4% and 15.3% respectively. However, the television category provided a bright spot, with on-location shoot days increasing by 17%, fueled by gains in TV dramas and reality shows. The report comes as California implements an expanded film and TV tax credit program aimed at boosting local production and competing with other locations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has finalized a trade and military agreement with the Philippines.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DuPont's stock saw a positive turn after China's market regulator announced the suspension of its antitrust investigation into the company. The probe, which began in April and was viewed as potential retaliation for U.S. tariffs, had created significant market uncertainty for the chemical giant. The investigation concerned DuPont's Tyvek business, a relatively small portion of its sales, but investors worried it could disrupt the planned spinoff of its larger electronics division. The suspension removes a major overhang for the company ahead of its upcoming corporate breakup and second-quarter earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings from a $20,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD), comparing current interest rates to those available a year ago. The calculations show a noticeable decline in returns; for example, a 3-year CD opened in 2024 could have earned over $1,000 more than one opened today. Despite the drop, the article notes that current rates are still substantially higher than they were at the beginning of the 2020s. It suggests that with interest rate cuts potentially looming, now may still be an opportune time for savers to lock in a guaranteed return. (not investment advice)</p>

During a recent earnings call, they emphasized that GM's "inherent advantage" lies in its diverse lineup of both gas-powered and electric vehicles. This flexibility allows the company to adapt to fluctuating consumer demand for EVs, especially as federal tax credits are set to expire. While acknowledging slower-than-expected EV growth, CEO Mary Barra affirmed that a profitable electric vehicle future remains the company's "North Star," even as it navigates a volatile market.</p>

While "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar, has long been popular in the U.S., this new product will be an official offering for the American market.

          <p>A recently passed bill has established a new student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven plan calculates monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum payment. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years and provides a $50 monthly credit for each qualifying dependent. As the legislation also phases out some existing repayment options, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers in the future.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2017, the number of working Americans with a side hustle is shrinking, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report found that 27% of workers have a second income stream, a significant drop from 36% in 2024. Analysts attribute the decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic pressure on individuals to take on extra work. This shift suggests that more people are feeling less financial anxiety, though it remains to be seen if the trend will continue. (not investment advice)</p>
