To qualify, borrowers generally need a minimum debt balance of $5,000 to $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship. While debt forgiveness can occur through various avenues, including debt settlement agreements and bankruptcy, it's essential to understand the specific terms and qualifications of each debt relief option.
