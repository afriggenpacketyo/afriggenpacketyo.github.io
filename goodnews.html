          <p>David Litt, a former Obama speechwriter, befriends his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a truck driver and Joe Rogan fan, in his new book, 'It's Only Drowning.' The article explores how their shared experience of learning to surf together creates a neutral ground for connection despite their different backgrounds and political views. Litt reflects on America's deep political and cultural divisions and argues for shared activities that allow for understanding between individuals with differing views. He also acknowledges the Democratic party's class problem and the need to connect with working-class voters.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic reviews Pip Adam's novel 'Audition,' which explores dystopian space exploration and alternative forms of human relation. The story follows three giants hurtling through space, confined within a ship that gets its power from their speech. The review highlights how language can be polluted and used as a means of exploitation. The novel imagines space as both a prison and a site of uncharted possibility, suggesting the need to move beyond Earth's prejudices and hierarchies.</p>

The Terminally Ill Adults Bill was passed by 314 votes to 291 in the House of Commons, but will need to go through the Lords before becoming law. Broadcaster Dame Esther, who joined the Swiss assisted dying clinic Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2023, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Their job is to scrutinise, to ask questions, but not to oppose."</p>

Alaina Beresford, from Portknockie in Moray, sent the message in 1994 when she was 12 as part of a school project. It washed up across the North Sea where it was found by a volunteer cleaning up a Norwegian island, who then dispatched a postcard to the sender.
