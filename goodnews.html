          <p>The UK government announced that a new artificial intelligence tool, the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, helped recover nearly £500 million lost to fraud over the past year, with a significant portion related to pandemic-era schemes. This innovative AI, developed by the Cabinet Office, is designed to scan new policies for weaknesses, aiming to "fraud-proof" them before implementation. Despite civil liberties concerns regarding government AI use, ministers hail the record-breaking recovery as a major success, with the savings earmarked for public services. This article details the tool's effectiveness and its planned international licensing to countries like the US and Australia.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman unveiled an ambitious $850 billion infrastructure plan with partners like Oracle and Nvidia, aiming to build 17 gigawatts of data centers to meet soaring AI demand. Altman acknowledged public concerns about the massive spending, but asserted it's necessary for maximizing AI capabilities, likening it to previous tech revolutions. He also highlighted the critical need for electricity, with OpenAI investing in nuclear energy solutions to power these facilities. This article discusses the unprecedented scale of investment, potential market bubbles, and Altman's long-term vision for AI's gigantic societal value, despite the financial complexities and the "compute crunch" currently facing the industry.

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, ABC, has been ordered to pay Antoinette Lattouf an additional A$150,000 in penalties for unlawfully sacking her over a social media post about the war in Gaza.

          <p>The United Nations clarified that an escalator malfunction involving President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump was caused by a safety mechanism, not an intentional act. A UN spokesperson stated that a videographer from the US delegation inadvertently triggered the safety function while filming at the top of the escalator, causing it to stop. This explanation contradicts White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's earlier suggestion of a deliberate sabotage and her call for an investigation. This article details the UN's findings and addresses the controversy surrounding the incident, including a separate teleprompter issue during Trump's speech, which the UN noted was operated by the White House.</p>
