          <p>Dr. Gladys Maestre is conducting critical research in South Texas, where nearly 20% of people over 65 suffer from memory loss, significantly higher than the national average. Her study, supported by a new $3 billion state bill pending voter approval, explores genetic, environmental, and generational factors like trauma and poverty. Maestre's work, including blood testing for biomarkers, aims to identify at-risk individuals for early prevention programs. The widespread impact of dementia is evident in families like the Johonnetts, highlighting the urgent need for answers.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump and other plaintiffs following his suspension from the platform in 2021. Of the settlement, $22 million will go to the Trust for the National Mall for Trump’s White House State Ballroom construction, with $2.5 million allocated to other plaintiffs. The settlement explicitly states it is not an admission of liability or fault. Trump's account was suspended after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack for violating policies against inciting violence, and was restored over two years later. This article follows similar settlements with Meta and X.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are projected to open higher on Tuesday, with significant attention on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate decision. Analysts, including a Reuters poll, expect the RBA to maintain its cash rate at 3.6% due to persistent high inflation, limiting monetary policy loosening. Shier Lee Lim of Convera noted that any shift in the RBA's tone or forward guidance could impact AUD crosses, especially after recent volatility in building approvals. Futures for Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index both indicate an upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>LeBron James' equivocal "maybe" regarding his retirement at the Lakers' media day has cast an uncertain shadow over the upcoming season. Entering his 23rd NBA season at 40, James has not signed an extension, making him a free agent next year. This ambiguity could lead to various scenarios, from a farewell tour to a midseason buyout or even a departure after his contract expires. This article suggests James' decision will be personal, not influenced by teammates like Luka Doncic. His uncertainty places the Lakers in a potentially "murky maybe mess," dependent on team performance and his evolving feelings.</p>

Candidates offered diverse perspectives, with some praising Newsom's economic efforts, healthcare initiatives, or stance against the Trump administration. Others, like Republican Chad Bianco, were highly critical, while some Democrats, such as Xavier Becerra and Antonio Villaraigosa, suggested areas for quicker action like high-speed rail and housing. Key issues highlighted for future governors include healthcare, housing costs, and fiscal accountability.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that the current enthusiasm for artificial intelligence differs significantly from the 2000 dotcom bubble, citing the financial strength and quality of today's leading tech companies. He notes that major players like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon are cash-rich and developing diverse reputations, unlike many debt-laden dotcom firms that failed. While acknowledging the massive investments in AI and data centers, Cramer expresses confidence in these companies' ability to pivot if needed. He still advises scrutiny, believing skepticism helps keep the market in check and prevents widespread over-speculation. (not investment advice)</p>
