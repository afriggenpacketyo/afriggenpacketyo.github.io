          <h2>Health Experts Warn of Potential Downsides to 'Internal Shower' Chia Seed Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:20:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular online health trend involving drinking water mixed with chia seeds, promoted as an "internal shower," could have negative effects if not prepared correctly. Experts advise that for the high-fiber drink to aid digestion and prevent constipation, the seeds must be soaked for at least 20 minutes to form a gel-like coating. Consuming them too quickly can cause the seeds to absorb water within the gut, leading to bloating, gas, and constipation, effectively reversing the intended benefits. Nutritionists recommend starting with small amounts to allow the digestive system to adapt to the increased fiber intake.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump underwent vascular testing due to mild swelling in his lower legs. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the examination, which included doppler ultrasounds, revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition for his age. The tests showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and an echocardiogram indicated normal heart function. Leavitt also attributed minor bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, reiterating that he remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned six key leaders and affiliates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including its head, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. The sanctions aim to disrupt the gang's operations, which have expanded from a prison-based extortion ring to a transnational criminal organization involved in murder, human trafficking, and sexual assault. The action blocks all U.S.-based assets and transactions involving the designated individuals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the administration is dedicated to dismantling the group to prevent it from terrorizing communities and harming innocent people in the region.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has approved former economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko as the new prime minister, following the resignation of Denys Shmyhal. This major government reshuffle, occurring under martial law, is aimed at improving management and implementing agreements with international partners, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Svyrydenko, a 39-year-old confidante of the president, is seen as a dynamic politician with experience in wartime negotiations. While some political analysts believe the change is a necessary response to internal tensions, others doubt it will lead to significant domestic policy shifts, with key decisions still being made by the president's office.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in the UK have engaged in what they describe as "constructive discussions" with Health Secretary Wes Streeting, raising hopes that a planned five-day strike could be averted. The doctors' union, the BMA, stated that talks will continue and that "nothing is off the table" in finding creative solutions to the ongoing pay dispute. While the government maintains it cannot increase its 5.4% pay offer for this year, it is reportedly considering other measures to improve working conditions. The BMA argues that doctors' real-terms pay remains significantly lower than in 2008.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Lowering National Voting Age to 16</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 13:55:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all national elections, potentially by the next general election. Ministers argue the change will increase democratic engagement, while critics suggest it is a political move to benefit the Labour Party, which polls strongly among younger voters. However, experts note that 16 and 17-year-olds represent a small fraction of the electorate and that their lower turnout rates would likely result in a negligible impact on overall election results. The move follows the fracturing of the youth vote, with parties like the Greens, Liberal Democrats, and Reform UK also competing for their support.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has lifted the sweeping gag order in the case against Bryan Kohberger, who recently pleaded guilty to the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. The judge agreed with a coalition of news organizations that with a trial no longer planned, the primary purpose of the order—to ensure an impartial jury—was no longer relevant. Lifting the order protects the First Amendment rights of the public and the press to receive information about the case. However, the judge denied a motion to unseal case documents at this time, stating he will review them for potential release after Kohberger's sentencing.</p>

          <p>The six largest U.S. banks generated approximately $39 billion in second-quarter profits, exceeding analyst expectations and signaling a surprisingly strong financial environment. Despite initial market fears over President Trump's tariff policies, a boom in trading and investment banking has bolstered Wall Street. Banks like JPMorgan Chase reported robust loan growth and cooling economic risk indicators, suggesting a low probability of a near-term recession. This performance reflects corporate and consumer confidence, as businesses proceed with major transactions and American consumers continue to spend and borrow, painting a positive picture for the economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent repeal of many green-energy tax breaks from the Inflation Reduction Act is a positive development, despite not being a full rollback. The author contends that such subsidies distort the market, misallocate capital, and create cronyism rather than genuine innovation and abundance. While acknowledging that some fossil-fuel subsidies also exist and should be removed, the article asserts they are dwarfed by the scale of green-energy incentives. The piece concludes that the partial rollback demonstrates that fighting against entrenched special-interest tax preferences is possible and should be pursued further. (not investment advice)</p>
