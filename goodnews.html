          <p>A new report indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering some relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops over the past three years, primarily due to a growing inventory of homes for sale. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited supply, creating a divided real estate landscape. This divergence is attributed to regional differences in new construction and the number of homes staying on the market longer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Yreka, a small city in Northern California, were briefly ordered to shelter in place on Tuesday morning after an industrial accident at a local cement plant released a large dust cloud. County officials issued the alert out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazard of airborne cement particles. The order, which advised residents to turn off air conditioning and remain indoors, was lifted in less than an hour as the cloud dissipated. Authorities have confirmed that any settled dust is safe to wash away and will release more information about the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with $10,000, deciding between a 3-month certificate of deposit and a high-yield savings account involves weighing guaranteed returns against flexibility. Currently, a top-rate high-yield savings account would narrowly earn more interest over three months than a top-rate 3-month CD. However, the CD rate is fixed, providing certainty, while the savings account rate is variable and could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected. The article suggests that the negligible difference in earnings means the choice should depend more on an individual's need for liquidity versus rate stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for a large sum like $100,000 are advised to ask critical questions first. A key consideration is the impact of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, as HELOCs have variable rates that would decrease, lowering payments over time. However, homeowners should also question how significant these cuts will be and whether a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a better option for stability. The article stresses that borrowing against home equity should always be done cautiously due to the risk of foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>
