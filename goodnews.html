He noted the difficulty of managing the distractions caused by the fireworks. With Jack Draper also advancing, it marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the last 16 at the French Open, and Norrie may face Novak Djokovic in the next round. </p>

          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties, but exceptions exist if you or your spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees and covered by their health insurance. Delaying also allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which cease upon Medicare enrollment. It's crucial to confirm appropriate coverage with the employer's benefits department before delaying Medicare application. The article clarifies the complexities of capital gains and home sales, distinguishing between the home sale exemption and 1031 exchanges for investment properties.</p>

          <p>The rising cost of ingredients and overhead has led to an increase in the price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich at El Vacilon Grocery, a bodega in Brooklyn. The owners, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, raised the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, due to soaring egg costs. Despite revenue declining over the years, the bodega remains afloat due to the Melos owning the building and collecting rent from apartments above the store. The sandwich is a staple in New York City, ubiquitous like bagels and pizza, and is known as "bandera" at El Vacilon.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and being used to distract from the primary goal of making money. Studies show that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, while Gen Zers may cling to buzzwords as corporate life rafts. The article suggests speaking in real, human language and using metaphors from poetry instead. Corporate cheerleaders promote buzzwords as creating a culture of inclusion, but research indicates they undermine trust.</p>
