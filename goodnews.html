          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to phase out animal experimentation, with the FDA planning to eliminate animal testing requirements for monoclonal antibodies and the EPA aiming to revive a ban on animal testing. The NIH also announced a major initiative to reduce animal use in research and develop animal-free methods, citing the limited relevance of animal models to human outcomes. These moves could spare millions of animals from experiments and potentially improve research, but some scientists are skeptical, fearing it's a way to cut science funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts toward gender equality, many people still assume mothers are the default parent, often overlooking fathers' roles and responsibilities. Research shows schools and medical offices are more likely to contact mothers, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact. This bias can create frustrations for both parents, disrupting mothers' work and undermining fathers' involvement. Outdated software systems and societal stereotypes contribute to this issue, highlighting the need for institutions to update their practices and recognize fathers as equally capable caregivers.</p>

          <p>Co-op anticipates shelves will be more fully stocked this weekend following a cyber-attack that disrupted its online ordering system. The hack resulted in payment issues, widespread shortages, and compromised customer data. The company is gradually restoring its systems and working with suppliers to restock stores. Experts caution that the cyber-attack will have lasting reputational and financial impacts, with customers likely to be more cautious about sharing personal information.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe will not face criminal charges related to alleged threats, the Crown Prosecution Service announced, citing insufficient evidence. Lowe, who now sits as an independent MP, was suspended by Reform UK in March following claims of threats towards the party's chairman. He accused Reform of conducting a "brutal smear campaign" and attacked party leader Nigel Farage, stating he had been targeted for questioning the party's direction and policies.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup Pony.ai reported its first robotaxi fire in Beijing, with no injuries, but did not disclose the cause. The electric, fully self-driving vehicle initiated an emergency stop, and service workers responded within two minutes. Shares of Pony.ai fell more than 10% overnight following the incident. The company is working with Toyota, Beijing's BAIC, and GAC's Aion for new robotaxi vehicles to cut costs, amid increasing competition with U.S. rivals in the Chinese electric car market.</p>
