        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at boosting security cooperation and reducing trade barriers nearly a decade after the Brexit vote. The deal, championed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, seeks to reset relations with the EU amidst concerns over U.S. commitment to European security. Key provisions include easing border crossings for British travelers, facilitating pet travel, and lifting restrictions on certain British meat product sales in the EU. The agreement also extends European fishing access to UK waters until 2038, a point of contention for some, while business sectors largely welcomed the move for its potential to cut costs and increase sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With economic uncertainty looming, many Americans are considering annuities as a means to secure their retirement income. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income and protection against market volatility, with tax-deferred growth and no contribution limits. However, they also come with fees, limited access to funds, and potential early withdrawal penalties. Experts advise balancing annuity investments with accessible accounts, researching company strength, and creating a financial plan before committing. Considering current economic conditions and consulting with a financial advisor are essential to determine if an annuity fits one's retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French police have recovered the bust of Jim Morrison, the iconic singer of The Doors, 37 years after it was stolen from his grave at P√®re Lachaise cemetery in Paris. The sculpture, created by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was found during a fraud case investigation. Morrison's grave remains a popular site for rock fans, despite the mysteries surrounding his death in 1971. The Doors were a significant band in the late 1960s and early 70s, known for hits like "Riders on the Storm" and "Light My Fire."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 11:46:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest improving sleep quality by rethinking eating habits, emphasizing the importance of nutrients, fats, sugar, and fiber. Consuming foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds and turkey, can aid in the production of serotonin and melatonin, which regulate sleep. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables, like bananas and cherries, provides sleep-supporting nutrients and fiber. Avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, as well as alcohol right before bed, can prevent disruptions to sleep cycles. Lastly, avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime promotes better digestion and more restful sleep.</p>

          <p>Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance is set to govern again in a minority government following recent elections, but the hard-right Chega party has emerged as a powerful political force. Chega, with its anti-immigrant message, won over 22 percent of the vote, signaling a significant shift in Portuguese politics. The party's rise reflects broader trends in Western Europe, where hard-right parties are gaining traction. While the Democratic Alliance has refused to ally with Chega, the party's growing influence is likely to put pressure on the government to adopt more conservative stances on issues like immigration.</p>
