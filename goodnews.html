          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have initiated a crucial call to finalize a deal concerning the future of TikTok in the United States. The conversation follows the establishment of a deal "framework" earlier in the week, aimed at resolving the ultimatum faced by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. Under a federal law signed by former President Biden, ByteDance must either divest its American operations or face a nationwide ban. President Trump, who has previously extended the deadline, expressed his desire to keep the popular social media platform operational in the U.S., citing its tremendous value.</p>

          <p>Former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright recently shared his thoughts on the significant rule changes in Major League Baseball, such as the pitch clock. While he praises the now-shorter game times, calling them "perfect," he misses the strategic pauses and mental gamesmanship that built drama in high-stakes moments. Wainwright also discussed the dual-edged sword of analytics, appreciating how data can refine a pitcher's technique but cautioning against over-reliance on computer-generated advice that ignores the human element of the sport. He believes the ideal approach lies in a balance between old-school intuition and new-school data.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations detailing President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which was enacted in July. The new rule allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028, with the benefit phasing out for those with incomes over $150,000. Officials clarified that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, will not qualify for the deduction. Furthermore, automatically added gratuities will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments from customers.</p>

          <p>The newly merged Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a significant cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, with a potential bid speculated to be between $22 and $24 per share. This move could preempt Warner Bros. Discovery's own plans to separate its TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. If successful, the acquisition would create a media behemoth with an extensive portfolio of television networks, major film studios, and valuable sports rights. While sources caution the price range is speculative, the news caused a slight increase in Warner Bros. Discovery's stock price.</p>

          <h2>Retailers Employ 'Tariff Hacking' Strategy to Mitigate Trade War Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 10:38:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to increased tariffs from the ongoing trade war, retailers are adopting a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce costs for consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party "merchant of record," which purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, rather than the full retail price. Companies using this method report significant savings, allowing them to avoid passing the full tariff costs onto customers and maintain competitive pricing. However, some logistics experts warn this "tariff arbitrage" may not be a scalable long-term solution and could attract future regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest in Munich has commenced, with an estimated six to seven million visitors expected to attend the world's largest folk festival. A notable feature this year is the record-high price of beer, with a one-liter stein, or Mass, costing over €15 in most tents. Despite the price increase, organizers anticipate that around seven million liters of beer will be consumed. The festival is also continuing its push for sustainability, aiming to be completely climate-neutral by 2028 by using green electricity, recycling water, and promoting regional and organic food options alongside traditional favorites.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have been released and have emotionally reunited with their daughter in Doha, Qatar. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived and run a charity in Afghanistan for nearly two decades. Their release was secured through Qatari mediation after months of lobbying by their family, who had raised serious concerns about their deteriorating health in detention. The Taliban claimed the pair had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, stating they were freed after judicial proceedings.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has slightly decreased, making it an attractive option for homeowners needing funds. A new analysis shows that a $25,000 home equity loan with a 10-year term now costs approximately $309 per month, while a 15-year term costs around $243 per month. These fixed-rate payments offer stability compared to variable-rate HELOCs. With total home equity levels at a record high, these loans present an accessible and affordable borrowing method for many Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has explicitly stated that the recent price increase for the new iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the company's flagship New York store, Cook clarified that Apple has managed to avoid passing tariff costs on to consumers for its phones. The company has been diversifying its supply chain, moving some production to countries like India and Vietnam to circumvent the levies. Despite this, Apple did report an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the previous quarter, affecting other areas of its business.</p>

Atkins stated that if the rule is approved, the decision to switch to a six-month schedule would be left to individual companies, allowing the market to decide the appropriate cadence.
