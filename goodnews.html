          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 roles as part of a cost-cutting initiative expected to save ¬£60 million by 2027. This decision follows a previous ¬£40 million cost-cutting measure announced in November, bringing total estimated savings to ¬£100 million. The job cuts will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and the Castleford factory in England, impacting about 20% of Burberry's overall headcount. CEO Joshua Schulman aims to revive the brand's fortunes amidst a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and geopolitical tensions, focusing on timeless pieces like the signature trench coat, which poses a challenge due to its longevity limiting repeat purchases.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to fully cover childbirth costs, potentially starting in April 2026, as a measure to combat the country's declining birthrate.

Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by medical insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures.

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to phase out animal testing requirements across various federal agencies, including the FDA, EPA, and NIH.
