          <p>Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, is anticipated to present new measures aimed at decreasing UK net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The forthcoming immigration white paper is expected to emphasize skills investment by employers, stricter visa application scrutiny for nationalities with high overstay rates, potentially extending the residency requirement for migrants seeking permanent residency, and more stringent English language proficiency standards. New regulations governing the recruitment of international care workers, effective since April, will also be highlighted, mandating that employers prioritize recruiting from within England before seeking overseas workers. The government is also reviewing the application of Article 8 of the ECHR in immigration cases to establish a clearer legal framework.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has described the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for further trade opportunities, noting that the agreement reduces or eliminates tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on UK imports like cars, steel, and aluminum. While the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) was discussed during negotiations, Mandelson clarified that its abolishment was not part of the deal. Mandelson also commented on the relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, noting their mutual defense of national interests and straightforward communication.

Judge Susan Illston ruled that the plaintiffs, federal employee unions, are likely to prove that the administration's reorganization and downsizing efforts exceed its legal authority.
