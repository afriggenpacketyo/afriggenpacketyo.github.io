          <p>A new retrospective in Manhattan celebrates the work of Dutch-American painter Joop Sanders, who was the last surviving member of the original Abstract Expressionist movement when he died in 2023 at 101. Curated by his granddaughter, Isca Greenfield-Sanders, the exhibit highlights his significant contributions and his place alongside contemporaries like Willem de Kooning. The article details his journey, including his early involvement in the landmark 9th Street Show of 1951 and his time in Europe.

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, have reportedly docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic achievement in autonomous satellite servicing and refueling. According to space situational awareness provider COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged rendezvous and proximity operations, appearing "visually merged" for several days. This complex maneuver, which the United States has not yet accomplished, demonstrates China's advancing capabilities in space. The event was closely monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites, indicating the strategic importance of this technological milestone in space operations.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Make Electric Vehicles More Affordable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 08:58:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers, aiming to boost adoption rates. While details on potential grants were not confirmed, the pledge comes alongside a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways. The move addresses the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a significant barrier for many drivers. This policy initiative is part of the UK's strategy to meet its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, as current EV sales lag behind manufacturer targets.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert. It was found in Niger in November 2023 and represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet. The auction, part of a natural history sale, also features a rare juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton, highlighting the high-value market for unique scientific and historical artifacts.</p>

          <p>The UK continues to experience a heatwave, with temperatures reaching a high of 33.1°C in England on Saturday, and Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also recording their warmest days of the year. Amber heat-health alerts remain in effect for southern and central England until Monday, when cooler temperatures and rain are expected to arrive. The intense heat has led to hosepipe bans for millions and prompted an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. The weather pattern is expected to break on Monday, bringing needed rainfall but also the potential for heavy showers and thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered the well-preserved wreck of a 19th-century ship. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping other known underwater sites when they found the partially buried hull, believed to be the L.W. Crane. The L.W. Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries even in well-traveled waterways and adds a new piece to the region's maritime history. Further investigation of the site is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, or white sugar, offering a potential pathway to turn captured carbon dioxide into food. The process uses enzymes and does not require land or water-intensive crops like sugar cane. Since methanol can be derived from industrial waste or by hydrogenating CO2, this method presents a novel solution to address both environmental challenges and food security. The researchers from the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology say this "in vitro biotransformation" is a promising platform for sustainable biomanufacturing of complex carbohydrates.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing crisis, California is creating a dedicated state agency focused exclusively on housing and homelessness. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the existing Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency to elevate housing issues to a cabinet-level priority. Supporters hope this reorganization will streamline the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing financing system, which currently involves multiple departments and adds costs and delays to projects.
