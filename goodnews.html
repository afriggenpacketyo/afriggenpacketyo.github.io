          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal government's takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new pact, the local police chief will remain in control, rather than a federally appointed administrator from the Drug Enforcement Administration. This development de-escalates a tense power struggle that began after the administration declared a crisis and moved to federalize the city's law enforcement, a move local leaders had challenged in court as a hostile takeover.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's move to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the action. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, legislators argue that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions necessary to justify such a takeover. The resolution contends that the administration's claims of a crime crisis are misleading and that its actions have undermined public safety by blocking local funds and creating a backlog of criminal cases.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is reportedly preparing a secondary stock sale of around $6 billion, which would establish the company's valuation at an immense $500 billion.

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that she would nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine. Her primary condition is that the resolution must not involve Ukraine ceding any of its territory to Russia, thereby upholding Ukrainian sovereignty and not rewarding aggression. The comment represents a moment of unexpected political sentiment focused on a potential peaceful outcome, with Trump later describing her remarks as "very nice."</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, plans to launch an affordable, American-made pickup truck by keeping the base model as simple as possible. The company's strategy is to lower manufacturing costs and then allow consumers to customize the vehicle with over 100 different accessories. Despite the rollback of federal EV incentives, Slate believes its low initial price point will remain highly competitive in a market where cost is a major barrier for many potential EV buyers.

The argument is that such a move is necessary to revive the struggling American chipmaker and reduce the country's critical dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers. Proponents suggest that ensuring a secure domestic supply of advanced chips is a vital strategic interest, justifying the unusual step of direct government investment in a private company.
