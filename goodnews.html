          <p>Boeing and Qatar Airways have announced a monumental agreement for the purchase of up to 210 jets, marking Boeing's largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The deal, which includes 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 of the 777-9s, also involves a significant agreement with GE Aerospace for over 400 engines to power these planes. The White House estimates the deal will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over one million in total, while Boeing and Qatar Airways estimate around 400,000 jobs. This agreement could provide a crucial boost for Boeing, which has faced safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and financial losses in recent years, potentially drawing scrutiny toward Trump's acceptance of Qatar's luxury jet gift for the new Air Force One.</p>

          <p>US lawmakers are considering restructuring the State Department to better align economic and foreign policy goals as major economies begin to work around the United States, according to witnesses at a House subcommittee hearing. Witnesses, including former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler, warned that economic partnerships are advancing even without US involvement, especially to counter China‚Äôs growing influence. The committee aims to draft legislation addressing concerns that economic security and policy are integral to foreign policy, necessitating closer coordination among US government agencies, particularly in light of tariff impositions and trade threats. The goal is to create a more cohesive approach to economic statecraft to maintain US competitiveness and influence. </p>

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, expected to be operational by the mid-2030s, as Asia prepares for a significant travel surge. Terminal 5 will nearly double Changi Airport's existing area, increasing its handling capacity from 90 million to 140 million passengers annually. The expansion is part of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions, with projected investments of $240 billion in airport upgrades and new constructions between 2025 and 2035. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized that Terminal 5 will connect Changi with 200 cities, boosting the aviation ecosystem's contribution to Singapore's GDP.</p>

UK academics, including Professor David Carpenter from King's College London, authenticated the document after seeing digitized images on Harvard's website. The manuscript, now considered one of the world's most valuable documents, is one of only seven originals from that date still in existence.

          <p>This article analyzes winning Eurovision songs since 2000, revealing key elements for success. The analysis indicates that tracks about personal liberation, empowerment, and defiance against societal norms tend to resonate with voters. Singing in English is advantageous, though incorporating folk music elements can add cultural flair. Staging is crucial; performances should be visually striking and memorable, but novelty acts should be avoided. Dramatic key changes, once a Eurovision staple, are now best omitted, as recent winners have moved away from this traditional technique.</p>

The Study Times article emphasized the importance of stabilizing the market amidst global economic instability caused by trade tensions. The fund aims to mitigate irrational market volatility and safeguard the interests of small to medium-sized investors. The article also noted the successful implementation of similar mechanisms by other major economies, including Hong Kong's interventions during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog has released draft guidelines aimed at curbing the power of Google and Apple within their respective app stores. The proposed law, slated to fully take effect in December, seeks to promote competition by preventing the tech giants from blocking smaller firms' access to their app stores. It also restricts the use of data obtained from app store operations to benefit their own products and services. The law aims to prevent unfair treatment of software suppliers by prohibiting product screening outside of normal assessments. The commission hopes that this will benefit consumers by lowering prices and increasing app accessibility.</p>

Archival data indicates ongoing tectonic-like processes deforming its surface and recycling its crust. Large, round features called coronae could hold clues to Venus's interior processes, potentially mirroring Earth's early geological activity before plate tectonics. By analyzing gravity and topography data from NASA's Magellan probe, scientists identified 52 coronae overlying hot, buoyant plumes of molten material, driving tectonic activity through subduction and lithospheric dripping. These findings highlight the potential for future investigations to reveal parallels between Venus and Earth.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. US authorities had accused him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist," but the judge refuted these claims. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Mr Suri in separate proceedings. Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for "violence and terrorism".</p>

          <h2>China-Philippine Ties at Crossroads After Marcos Fails to Thwart Duterte Camp</h2>

          <p>China-Philippine relations face a reckoning after President Marcos' efforts to sideline the Duterte political camp were unsuccessful. Observers note that Duterte, now likely to survive an impeachment trial, could be a formidable candidate in the 2028 presidential election. Her pragmatic stance on China could improve bilateral ties if she wins the race. In recent midterm elections, candidates aligned with Marcos secured fewer Senate seats than expected, while Duterte's allies gained ground, potentially shielding her from conviction and preserving her eligibility for the 2028 election.</p>
