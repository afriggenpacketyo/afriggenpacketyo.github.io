          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre turn of events during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship, where he believes his ball was stolen by a spectator. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, the ball could not be found, with witnesses reporting two people running off with it. The situation allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing his provisional ball, a circumstance he said was a "good result" that likely saved him at least one stroke and improved his final score.</p>

          <p>The process to select the next chair of the Federal Reserve is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent personally meeting with several leading candidates. Bessent has recently held discussions with former Fed officials Kevin Warsh, Lawrence Lindsey, and James Bullard, who are all on President Trump's short list for the position. The search is taking place in a politically charged environment, as the White House has been publicly pressuring the central bank for an interest rate cut. Bessent is also reportedly pushing for a reform agenda at the Fed, including a reduction of its large balance sheet.</p>

          <p>Average U.S. mortgage rates have dropped to 6.35% for a 30-year term, their lowest point in almost a year, potentially signaling a new opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The decline is attributed to a cooling 10-year Treasury yield and widespread market expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming meeting. While rates could fall further, the article notes the market's volatility and suggests that now may be an opportune time for consumers to explore their options rather than waiting for an ideal but uncertain lower rate.

Under the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in American-based projects, and the two countries will split the resulting profits 50/50 until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift dramatically, with the U.S. receiving 90% and Japan receiving 10%.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is unfolding in Germany over the country's school curriculum, with some students and educators calling for a reduction in classic literature by authors like Goethe in favor of more diverse and contemporary works. Proponents of reform argue that required reading lists are dominated by white male authors and fail to reflect the multicultural reality of modern Germany, thus disengaging students. Conversely, others maintain that classics are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking, advocating for a balanced approach that includes both traditional and modern texts chosen in consultation with students.</p>
