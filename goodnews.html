          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," the Democratic governor described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to focus on common values over division. Shapiro, whose own home was firebombed in April, stressed the importance of distinguishing between protected political speech and illicit incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In one highlight, he juggled a fly ball off his foot before securing it for an out, and later made a leaping catch at the wall to rob a potential game-tying home run. The loss was significant for the Mets, as it dropped them into a tie for the final National League wildcard spot, making their playoff push more difficult.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated that his government would accept an interim deal where North Korea agrees to freeze its nuclear weapons production. He described such an agreement as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-stalled goal of complete denuclearization, noting that Pyongyang is currently producing 15-20 new weapons annually. President Lee also expressed hope that former U.S. President Donald Trump could successfully resume nuclear talks with Kim Jong Un, suggesting the two leaders share a degree of mutual trust.</p>

          <p>Sunday was a dramatic day in the NFL, with several Week 3 games featuring wild, last-second finishes centered on blocked field goals. The Philadelphia Eagles stunned the Los Angeles Rams when a potential game-winning kick was blocked and returned for a touchdown as time expired. In other games, the Cleveland Browns secured a comeback victory with a 55-yard field goal after a blocked kick gave them possession, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers also won on a final-play field goal set up by a blocked attempt, capping a day of unpredictable outcomes.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles overcame a 19-point second-half deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Rams 33-26 in a stunning finish at Lincoln Financial Field. The Rams were positioned for a potential 44-yard game-winning field goal in the final seconds, but the kick was blocked by defensive tackle Jordan Davis and returned for a touchdown as time expired. This dramatic loss denied the Rams a 3-0 start to their season and marked a major comeback victory for the defending Super Bowl champions in a key NFC matchup.</p>

          <h2>West Virginia School Principal Has Surprise Encounter with Bear in Dumpster</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A security camera at a West Virginia high school captured the startling moment the school's principal opened a dumpster, only to be surprised by a black bear that had been inside. The principal, James Marsh, quickly ran in one direction while the bear climbed out and fled in the other. No one was harmed in the incident, which serves as a humorous but important reminder of how unsecured trash can attract wildlife into developed areas, highlighting the need for proper waste management to prevent potentially dangerous human-animal encounters.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has announced it will increase its presence around synagogues, schools, and Jewish community centers during the High Holy Days, which begin with Rosh Hashana. This proactive measure is a response to a rise in antisemitic attacks across the country and is intended to deter crime and provide reassurance to the community. Mayor Karen Bass stated that antisemitism is unacceptable in Los Angeles and thanked the LAPD for its efforts to protect Jewish Angelenos during this significant religious period.</p>

          <h2>Manchester City's Defensive Tactics Nearly Secure Win Before Late Arsenal Equalizer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tactical analysis of the 1-1 draw between Arsenal and Manchester City reveals how City manager Pep Guardiola adopted an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead. This strategy, aimed at stifling Arsenal's attack and managing player fatigue from a packed schedule, nearly succeeded. However, Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli scored a 93rd-minute equalizer, salvaging a point for the home side. The result is viewed as a significant benefit for league leaders Liverpool, as both title contenders dropped crucial points in the match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris finished seventh in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, gaining only six points on his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri, who crashed out of the race. Norris attributed his disappointing result to a poor qualifying session in which he hit a wall, arguing that the difficulty of overtaking in Baku meant his starting position largely determined his final one. While Norris felt he maximized his performance during the race itself, the weekend is widely viewed as a missed opportunity to significantly close the gap in the F1 championship standings.</p>

England's bowlers, led by spinner Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup, setting the stage for Cox's match-winning performance with the bat.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning all traffic from a section of Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping areas. The event is part of a broader plan to permanently pedestrianize a stretch of the road to increase footfall, improve the visitor experience, and boost local businesses. While many visitors and shoppers supported the idea, some local groups and councillors have raised concerns about the potential for increased traffic congestion on smaller side streets and accessibility issues for those with mobility challenges.</p>
