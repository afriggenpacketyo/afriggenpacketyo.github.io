          <p>McLaren addressed concerns about team strategy after the Canadian Grand Prix, where Lando Norris' performance was impacted by errors. The team emphasized that it does not typically prioritize one driver over the other, except in specific circumstances. While Oscar Piastri has had a more consistent season, McLaren believes both drivers are performing at a high level, and the focus remains on maximizing the team's overall results. McLaren is trying to help Norris minimize mistakes and return to a more natural racing flow.</p>

          <p>The UK appears to have found a successful formula for maintaining favor with President Trump, securing a trade deal and earning his personal affection. Trump cited his liking for the UK as the reason for their protection from further tariffs. Strong cultural links and Trump's admiration for Prime Minister Keir Starmer contribute to the positive relationship. Unlike other global leaders, the UK has largely avoided conflict with Washington on trade and foreign policy.</p>

The plan aims to revitalize the high street and attract more visitors, but faces opposition over traffic diversion and accessibility concerns. Key questions remain about the impact on bus routes, bicycle access, and equality for disabled users. A new mayoral development corporation would provide planning powers for the project.</p>
