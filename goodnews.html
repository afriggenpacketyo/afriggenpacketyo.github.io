          <p>Philadelphia-based designer Andrew Hall has launched "&ndy," an activewear brand focused on creating a sense of belonging for the LGBTQ+ community in fitness spaces. Inspired by his own experiences as a gay college athlete, Hall designed the minimalist apparel to promote visibility and pride, incorporating subtle rainbow gradients and intentional designs. Operating the business solo, Hall has found significant success through social media, with many items selling out quickly, demonstrating a strong demand for more representative fitness fashion.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has indicated the bank will become involved in stablecoin technology, despite his personal skepticism about its advantages over traditional payment systems. Dimon stated that this move is necessary to understand the technology and to remain competitive against agile fintech rivals seeking to disrupt the financial ecosystem. The bank, which moves nearly $10 trillion daily, recently announced a limited-scope deposit coin for its clients but is now exploring more universally accepted stablecoins to avoid ceding ground in the global payments industry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating that the agreement involves a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the U.S. while granting American goods tariff-free access. The announcement, which followed direct talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, has not yet been confirmed by officials in Jakarta. This potential agreement would represent a reduction from the 32% tariff Trump had previously threatened. The move follows a similar pattern to a recent trade announcement with Vietnam, where details were initially sparse.</p>

President Trump's recent budget bill includes a temporary additional senior tax deduction of $6,000 for single filers and $12,000 for joint filers, which could provide substantial tax savings and offset the impact of a smaller COLA.
