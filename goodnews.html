        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has strategically diversified its business to become a formidable leader in the artificial intelligence sector. The company has expanded into various complex fields, including AI chips, data centers, and smart cars, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. This evolution was partly fueled by U.S. sanctions, which inadvertently pushed Huawei to innovate and gain significant state backing as a national champion. Analysts highlight Huawei's comprehensive approach, covering the entire AI value chain from hardware to industry-specific applications.</p>

          <h2>GLP-1 Weight Loss Drugs Show Promise as a Potential Treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 23:13:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known as GLP-1s, are showing significant potential for treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients and small-scale studies report that these medications can help alleviate key PCOS symptoms, such as irregular periods and weight management difficulties, by improving insulin sensitivity. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, experts see promise in GLP-1s, although larger clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy. Access remains a challenge, as the drugs are costly and often not covered by insurance for this unapproved use.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious drug trafficker Adolfo "Fito" Macias to the United States to face charges including cocaine distribution and conspiracy. Macias, the leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that plunged the nation into a state of "internal armed conflict." His extradition marks the first time Ecuador has sent one of its citizens to a foreign country for prosecution. The move is a significant step in the country's fight against powerful drug cartels that have transformed Ecuador into a key hub for global cocaine trade.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Argues Strong Fundamentals and Pro-Business Policies Support Stocks Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite market anxiety over looming trade tariff deadlines, some analysts argue that numerous positive factors are supporting the stock market. Strong corporate earnings and proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's "big beautiful bill" are expected to inject billions into the economy and boost consumer spending. Other tailwinds cited include massive investment in data centers, relaxed bank lending rules, and a pro-business approach to regulation and M&A activity, suggesting a resilient economic outlook. These factors combined could create circumstances for continued growth despite geopolitical trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers clashing with striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham, resulting in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent criminal case against the miners collapsed amid allegations that police falsified evidence. The inquiry aims to answer questions that have remained for 40 years, bringing a measure of justice to the affected miners and their communities.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has begun humorously warning audiences to be camera-ready before the band performs its "Jumbotron Song." This new practice follows a viral incident at a previous show where the camera focused on a man and woman, later identified as a CEO and an HR executive from the same company, who appeared to be having an affair. The resulting online fallout led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by their tech company. Martin's playful warning is a lighthearted acknowledgment of the segment's potential for creating unintended real-world consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert argues that teaching "self-connection" is the single most important skill for a child's success. Self-connection is the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions and needs, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The expert warns that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Instead, she advises validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self, and modeling self-awareness to foster a strong sense of self-worth that protects long-term mental health.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller, through his nonprofit Better Angels, is pioneering a new model to build affordable housing without taxpayer subsidies by making it profitable for private investors. Using a $300-million fund, the initiative provides equity to finance projects, aiming to build faster and cheaper than traditional developments that rely on slow government grants and tax credits. While resulting rents may be higher than in subsidized units, the goal is to create new housing for low- to moderate-income renters. The model seeks to prove that market-based capitalism can be harnessed to address the housing crisis.</p>
