          <p>China is currently experiencing a "gold fever" as prices for the precious metal dance near a never-before-seen US$3,900 an ounce, creating a complex dilemma for investors and consumers. Many are frustrated by missed opportunities to sell earlier or are wary of purchasing at these record-high levels, leading to widespread indecision on whether to buy, sell, or hold their assets. One Guangzhou-based engineer, for instance, sold 200 grams predicting a market correction, only to see prices continue their ascent, prompting him to switch to investing in silver. This volatile market reflects a pervasive mix of excitement and trepidation among the Chinese public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's determination regarding purported chaos in Portland was "simply untethered to the facts," asserting that the protests were not sufficiently violent or disruptive to justify federal military deployment. The judge underscored the nation's constitutional tradition against military intrusion into civil affairs, affirming the state's sovereignty and the capability of local law enforcement. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek, lauded the decision as a critical check on presidential authority.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers demonstrated remarkable resiliency in securing a 5-3 comeback victory against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. After trailing 3-0 early in the game, with Shohei Ohtani initially struggling on the mound, the Dodgers' offense gradually eroded the deficit. The pivotal moments included Kiké Hernández's two-out, two-run double in the sixth inning, which knocked the Phillies' ace out of the game. Teoscar Hernández then delivered the decisive blow with a stadium-silencing, three-run home run in the seventh, cementing an unexpected 1-0 series lead for the Dodgers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waiting in extended queues, often for many hours, is increasingly becoming a popular and even "cool" social activity, moving beyond mere inconvenience for many participants. This burgeoning trend is fueled by the "excitement and exhilaration" derived from anticipating exclusive products, significant bargains, or unique brand experiences, which triggers the release of dopamine in the brain. Brands are strategically capitalizing on this phenomenon through "experiential marketing" events, luring shoppers with complimentary products, limited stock, and interactive, social media-worthy moments. For those in line, queuing fosters a strong sense of camaraderie and provides an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals, transforming a potentially tedious wait into a communal and rewarding experience.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest Lutheran denomination in the U.S., has made history by installing the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. This landmark moment for the predominantly white church signifies a crucial step towards fostering greater diversity within its leadership ranks. Curry, 53, followed a unique path to Lutheran ministry, having grown up Catholic and initially engaging with a burgeoning Black congregation. In his new role, he will confront challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, such as declining membership and theological disagreements, but expresses hope that his leadership will inspire more leaders of color and cultivate a more interconnected church body.</p>

          <h2>Thousands Defy Ban to March in Hungary Pride Rally</h2>

          <p>Thousands of individuals participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, openly defying a police prohibition on LGBTQ+ rallies. This act of defiance occurs amidst Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ultra-conservative Fidesz party's ongoing efforts to restrict LGBTQ+ rights, including a recently passed law permitting the banning of Pride marches under the pretext of "protecting children." Several Members of the European Parliament joined the demonstration in solidarity, as protesters waved rainbow and EU flags while condemning the Hungarian government's policies. Despite the threat of fines, the substantial turnout highlights significant public opposition to the restrictive legislation.</p>

          <p>The previously winless UCLA Bruins pulled off a stunning 42-37 upset victory against No. 7 Penn State, under the guidance of tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel, who was elevated to playcaller just four days before the game. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a masterful performance, accounting for five touchdowns—three rushing and two passing—and significantly boosting the team's offensive output. This unexpected triumph marks UCLA's first victory over a top-10 team since 2007 and the first for a team starting 0-4 or worse against such a highly ranked opponent since 1985. Neuheisel's aggressive game plan and the players' belief were key to this remarkable turnaround.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Why University Students Often Contract "Freshers' Flu"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu," a collective term for common cold viruses, spreads rapidly among new university students due to a unique "mixing pot" of respiratory pathogens and compromised immune systems. Immunologists explain that the influx of thousands of students from diverse backgrounds creates a perfect environment for transmitting novel viruses in crowded lecture halls and shared living spaces. Contributing factors such as late nights, poor diet, elevated stress levels, and excessive alcohol consumption all suppress the immune system, making students more susceptible. While generally not serious, the combination of multiple infections and a weakened immune response can lead to prolonged and unpleasant symptoms. Experts recommend ample rest and medical consultation for persistent illness.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative that sought to detain immigrant children after their 18th birthdays, thereby preventing their transfer to adult detention centers. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that automatically holding these individuals violates a previous 2021 court order, which explicitly mandated their release to the "least restrictive setting available" unless they were deemed a danger or flight risk. This ruling marks another legal challenge against Trump’s controversial immigration policies, which have also included proposals to offer immigrant children money to self-deport and accusations of reviving family separation tactics to coerce individuals.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on its 70th anniversary, setting her on course to become the country's first female prime minister. Known as a staunch conservative and a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has previously held senior government roles and made two prior attempts at the leadership. Her policy platform, deeply influenced by personal experiences, includes expanding women's health services and improving care options for Japan's aging society, alongside a commitment to revive "Abenomics." Despite her historically conservative stances on issues like married names and same-sex marriage, she has recently adopted a more moderate tone during her campaign.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis convened in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the potential Gaza ceasefire deal, expressing profound hope for the return of all captives and a return to normalcy. Many protesters, some donning Trump masks, explicitly credited President Trump for brokering the agreement, while simultaneously criticizing Prime Minister Netanyahu for perceived delays and prioritizing political survival over the hostages' release. Despite Netanyahu's subsequent optimistic statement about a swift hostage return, some attendees remained skeptical of his genuine commitment to the deal. The prevailing public sentiment at the rally underscored a deep and urgent desire for peace and the safe repatriation of all those held captive.</p>
