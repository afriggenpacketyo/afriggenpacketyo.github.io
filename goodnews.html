          <p>Following a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives, the "Bitcoin Family" has overhauled their security measures by decentralizing their crypto storage. Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, explained that they now use a hybrid system involving analog and digital methods, with seed phrases encrypted, split, and stored across four continents. This new system aims to minimize risk by ensuring that no single location holds enough information to compromise their crypto holdings. The family, known for living entirely on bitcoin and traveling full-time, has also stopped posting travel updates and filming at home after receiving disturbing messages from strangers.</p>

          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made by Donald Trump regarding wind energy, which have been amplified on social media. Trump has repeatedly alleged that wind turbines are harmful to whales and birds, and that wind energy is not truly green. The article cites scientific evidence and data to refute these claims, highlighting that wind turbines are a relatively small factor in bird mortality compared to other causes, and that efforts are underway to improve the recyclability of wind turbine components. The article also clarifies that wind turbines do not operate constantly but are still highly efficient.</p>

Delaware's program includes a seven-year limit, a work requirement, and a savings incentive, which has helped some residents like Becca Morris achieve financial stability. However, experiences in Washington state show that time limits can be detrimental when affordable housing is scarce. Experts argue that support services and savings incentives are more crucial to success than strict time constraints.</p>
