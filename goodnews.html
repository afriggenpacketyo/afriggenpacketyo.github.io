          <h2>Federal Reserve Officials Divided on Timing and Quantity of Future Interest Rate Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting reveal a growing divergence of opinion among officials regarding future interest rate cuts. While most policymakers anticipate that some rate reductions will be appropriate this year, there is significant debate over the timing and number of cuts. Some officials see a potential cut as early as July, citing easing inflation, while others believe no cuts are warranted in 2025 due to the resilient economy. This division underscores the central bank's cautious, data-dependent approach as it navigates economic uncertainty and political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Five Strategies to Lower Student Loan Payments Amid Policy Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 15:02:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As federal student loan policies undergo significant changes, borrowers can take several steps to make their payments more manageable. Key strategies include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan before they are phased out, which can cap monthly payments based on income. For short-term financial hardship, requesting a temporary pause through deferment or forbearance can provide relief, though interest may still accrue. Other options include refinancing for a lower interest rate, seeking employer or state-based repayment assistance programs, and enrolling in autopay for a small interest rate discount.

          <p>McDonald's is aiming to attract inflation-weary customers by reintroducing its popular Snack Wrap and launching a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin. This menu refresh comes after the company experienced a significant decline in U.S. same-store sales and a drop in traffic from low-income consumers. The strategy focuses on a mix of nostalgia, new flavors, and value, with the revived Snack Wrap priced at $2.99 and other items being bundled into affordable meal deals. The moves reflect a broader fast-food industry trend of using promotions and menu tweaks to drive business amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Google has signed a landmark deal to purchase 200 megawatts of electricity from Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spin-off developing a commercial fusion reactor. This marks the largest fusion power purchase agreement to date and is Google's first investment in this form of clean energy. The power, intended to support the company's energy-intensive AI data centers, will come from the planned ARC fusion plant in Virginia, expected to be operational in the early 2030s. The move signals growing corporate demand for reliable, carbon-free energy sources beyond traditional renewables like wind and solar.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering tapping into their home equity face a key decision before the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting: whether to choose a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a traditional home equity loan. A HELOC offers a variable interest rate, which could be advantageous if the Fed signals rate cuts, but also carries the risk of rising payments if rates increase. Conversely, a home equity loan provides a fixed rate, offering stability and predictable payments in an uncertain rate environment. The choice depends on a borrower's risk tolerance and outlook on future interest rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, offers a revised perspective on the life of 1950s Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield. The film argues that Mansfield was a shrewd and talented performer with serious acting ambitions, often unfairly dismissed as a mere imitation of Marilyn Monroe. It explores how she navigated the restrictive studio system, strategically using her bombshell persona as a means to an end. The documentary serves as both an affectionate tribute and a critical look at an era in Hollywood that limited the potential of many female actors.</p>

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina, water rescue experts are emphasizing the importance of preparation and avoidance. They warn that just six inches of fast-moving water can be powerful enough to knock a person over, and survival once caught in the torrent is largely a matter of luck. The primary advice is to heed all warnings and get to high ground immediately. Experts also recommend having a weather radio, understanding the difference between flood watches and warnings, and never attempting to drive through flooded roadways, as a vehicle can be easily swept away.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen Group announced a significant 47% increase in the sale of its all-electric vehicles during the first half of 2025, with 465,000 units sold globally. The growth was primarily driven by a nearly 90% surge in European sales, where the company is a market leader. However, the positive European performance was tempered by sharp declines in North America, attributed partly to new tariffs, and a one-third drop in China, where the company faces intense competition from domestic EV manufacturers. Overall global deliveries for the group saw a slight increase of 1.3%.</p>

          <p>Washington's Mount Rainier is currently experiencing a significant "earthquake swarm," with hundreds of small seismic events detected since early Tuesday. The U.S. Geological Survey described it as the most notable seismic activity at the volcano in over 15 years. However, officials have assured the public there is no cause for concern, as the earthquakes are too small to be felt at the surface and are not indicative of an impending eruption. Scientists believe the swarm is likely caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust, a common occurrence at the active volcano.</p>

He also cited potential conflicts of interest with his broadcasting role on ESPN's "ManningCast" as another factor in his decision.
