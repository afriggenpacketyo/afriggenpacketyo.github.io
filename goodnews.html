          <p>A five-year-old girl is safe after falling overboard from a Disney cruise ship, prompting her father to heroically jump into the ocean to rescue her. The Broward Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident but has clarified that, contrary to some social media reports, the girl was not being held over the railing by her father before the fall. A passenger and a crew member reported that the girl had climbed the railing while her parents were nearby. Maritime experts have praised the father's quick actions and the ship's advanced man-overboard detection systems for preventing a tragedy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The ruling states that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering Haiti's TPS designation. The judge found that the interests of the Haitian immigrants, who rely on the status to live and work in the U.S., far outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision provides temporary relief to thousands facing deportation amid ongoing instability in Haiti.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S. southern border illegally dropped to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. Preliminary government data shows this continues an exceptional decline in illegal immigration, which the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive enforcement and deportation policies. This figure is a stark contrast to the peak levels under the previous administration, where daily crossings sometimes exceeded 10,000. For the second consecutive month, Border Patrol reportedly did not release any migrants into the U.S. interior, instead processing them for swift deportation.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a strict new anti-smoking law, banning smoking in most public spaces, including beaches, parks, and near schools and public transit. The measure aims to "denormalize" smoking, especially among young people, as tobacco-related illnesses kill over 200 people in the country each day. Violators of the new ban face fines starting at 135 euros. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public venues since 2008, this law extends the restrictions to many outdoor areas, though sidewalk caf√© terraces remain a notable exception.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's strictest law regulating PFAS, often called "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, known as "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the bill while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's community had been affected by PFAS waste from the manufacturer 3M, which has since agreed to stop producing the chemicals and pay $850 million for cleanup.</p>

The goal is to create designs that serve as a symbolic representation of the UK's collective national identity.

          <p>In a major policy shift, California has passed significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to accelerate housing construction and address the state's affordability crisis. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, exempts most urban infill housing projects from the lengthy and often litigious environmental review process that has historically delayed or blocked development. While proponents hail the move as a crucial step to remove barriers to building, environmental groups have fiercely criticized the overhaul as an unprecedented rollback of essential protections for communities and wildlife.</p>

The incident, likely involving an escaped pet, highlights the broader problem of invasive species, which can disrupt natural habitats and push endangered native animals closer to extinction.</p>
