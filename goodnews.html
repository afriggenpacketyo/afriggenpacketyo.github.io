          <p>An object believed to be an unexploded wartime bomb was discovered at a construction site on Hiroshima University's Kasumi campus in western Japan. The object, measuring around 90 centimeters long and 25 cm in diameter, prompted the restriction of access to the site and cancellation of afternoon classes. The Self-Defense Forces were called in to dispose of the object, which was found during excavation work for the demolition of a building belonging to the university's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The location is approximately 1.8 kilometers south of JR Hiroshima Station.</p>

          <p>A government survey in Japan indicates that around half of respondents believed at least one instance of false information on social media after encountering it. The survey, the first of its kind, highlights the serious problem of fake news and the need to improve media literacy among the public. Approximately one in four individuals who came across such misinformation went on to spread it further, finding the content "surprising," "interesting," or "helpful to others." Internal affairs minister Seiichiro Murakami emphasized the importance of enhancing media literacy and urged people to be skeptical and verify information before sharing it.</p>

The agreement, which involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs, has prompted institutions like UBS, Morgan Stanley, and ANZ Bank to raise their GDP growth estimates for China in 2025. UBS now projects growth between 3.7% and 4%, while Morgan Stanley anticipates stronger near-term quarterly GDP due to accelerated exports.

          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates have been reduced from triple-digit levels. Chinese goods shipped to the US will now face a minimum of 30% in tariffs, while American exports will incur at least 10% in duties, down from 145% and 125%, respectively. However, these rates do not include previous tariffs imposed during Trump's initial term or other duties on specific goods. The new effective tariff rate is estimated to be around 50%, combining the earlier 20% tariffs with the current 30% duties, affecting Chinese manufacturers and exporters.</p>
