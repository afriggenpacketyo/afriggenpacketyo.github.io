          <p>Trade talks between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed the policy reversal following a phone call with Trump, aiming to progress towards a new economic and security agreement. Critics suggest the retreat makes the Canadian government appear vulnerable to U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in the protein prohibitin. The research, conducted at a single-cell resolution on primate cochleae, offers new insights into the cellular and molecular aging patterns that lead to hearing decline. The scientists also found that the diabetes medication metformin could slow the condition's progression in monkeys, suggesting a potential future clinical treatment for humans and paving the way for personalized medical interventions.</p>

A Chinese government-backed foundation announced plans to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, reinterpreting them for new audiences through animation and other technologies. This no-holds-barred strategy highlights a significant cultural and industrial divergence, as U.S. guilds like the DGA express strong opposition to altering a director's original work, fearing it could distort a filmmaker's artistic vision.</p>
