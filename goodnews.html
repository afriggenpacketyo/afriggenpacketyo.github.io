          <p>Han Duck-soo, the former prime minister of South Korea and acting president, has announced his candidacy for president in the upcoming snap election triggered by Yoon Suk Yeol's ousting. Han, a conservative, resigned from his position as acting president to pursue the presidency, pledging to devote his utmost to the Republic of Korea. He has previously served as prime minister under Yoon Suk Yeol and Roh Moo-hyun, as well as trade minister, finance minister, and ambassador to the US. His entry intensifies the conservative field as they seek to unify against Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung, whose campaign recently faced legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the enduring relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail." Eig emphasizes that King's message was rooted in the belief that love has the power to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems. King's protests in Birmingham aimed to condemn segregation laws and call Americans to action, believing that government leaders and ordinary citizens would choose mercy over meanness if they witnessed injustice firsthand. Eig suggests that King's letter offers a pathway for those who disapprove of current tactics and wish to fight back against cruelty, advocating for determined legal and nonviolent pressure to achieve civil rights gains.</p>

          <p>The children of Leonard Bernstein, Nina Bernstein Simmons, Alexander Bernstein, and Jamie Bernstein, have decided to allow their father's music to be performed at the Kennedy Center despite concerns over President Trump's influence on the institution. They argue that Bernstein would have wanted his music to be heard, as he believed in its power to unite and uplift all Americans. They note that Bernstein himself faced pressures to curtail his artistic activity in the past, but he always chose to play music, believing in its ability to transcend violence and hate. The proceeds from upcoming Kennedy Center performances will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

          <p>A viral debate about whether 100 men could defeat a silverback gorilla has prompted discussions about the true nature of gorillas. While a gorilla possesses immense strength and power, experts suggest that the sheer number of humans would likely overwhelm it through coordination and strategic attacks. However, the discussion also highlights the need to shift focus towards the real fight: saving gorillas from extinction. Gorillas are critically endangered, and raising awareness about their plight is crucial for their survival.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks is gaining momentum, fueled by support from President Trump and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Recent stock trades by lawmakers around tariff announcements have raised concerns about potential insider trading, prompting renewed calls for reform. Legislation to bar lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks has been introduced in both the House and Senate, with proponents arguing that it would reduce conflicts of interest and restore public trust. While some lawmakers express concerns about the impact on their ability to save for retirement, supporters emphasize that serving in Congress is a privilege that should not be used for personal financial gain.</p>
