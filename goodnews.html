          <h2>Tensions Rise in England-India Cricket Match Over Delay Tactics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 16:22:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The third day of the third Test at Lord's ended in a tense standoff as England's batters used delay tactics to avoid facing an extra over from India's bowlers. Opener Zak Crawley repeatedly paused play after being hit on the finger, angering Indian players, including captain Shubman Gill. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed India's complaints, pointing to their own time-wasting earlier in the match when Gill received a lengthy massage on the field. The incident added a layer of drama to a match already characterized by frequent stoppages.</p>

The performance underscored themes from his latest album, focusing on Puerto Rican pride, resistance, and joy while also addressing social injustices like gentrification. Having returned to live on the island after achieving worldwide fame, the artist is intensifying his focus on creating music that resonates deeply with his Puerto Rican audience.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history, becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured the championship with a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel. The win marks the first time two Britons have been crowned men's doubles champions at any Grand Slam since 1936. After the match, the pair expressed their disbelief and joy, with Cash stating that winning a Grand Slam, especially at Wimbledon, "couldn't mean more."</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon title with a stunningly dominant 6-0 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in just 57 minutes. The win, known as a "double bagel," was the most one-sided women's final at the tournament since 1911. For the 24-year-old Swiatek, this is her sixth Grand Slam title but her first on grass, a surface she was not expected to master. The victory makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win major titles on all three surfaces, solidifying her position among the sport's elite.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed campaign of tariff threats against major trading partners like the EU and Mexico, the U.S. stock market has remained near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have grown more accustomed to the president's negotiating style and are less prone to panic than they were during previous tariff announcements. The market's resilience is also attributed to strong underlying themes, such as the unfettered growth of artificial intelligence and a deregulatory environment that encourages M&A activity. These factors are seen as driving corporate earnings, which ultimately support the market's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are seeking a judicial review of government policy as part of a campaign to implement a complete ban on smartphones in schools. They have sent a legal letter to the Education Secretary, arguing that the current guidance, which lets headteachers decide their own policies, is unlawful and fails to keep children safe. The campaigners cite concerns over cyberbullying, access to violent and sexual content, and manipulation by online predators. They contend that a statutory ban is a "no-brainer" and would relieve pressure on both parents and school administrators.</p>
