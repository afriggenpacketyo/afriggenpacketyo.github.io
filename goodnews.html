This victory marks his fourth major title and his second of the 2025 season, further cementing his status as the world's number one player. With this win, Scheffler joins an elite group including Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as one of the few to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30.

          <p>For only the second time in its 116-year history, Girlguiding UK has launched a new set of 72 badges for its members, covering modern interests like 'fandoms,' 'laughtivism,' and environmental conservation. The update, developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers, aims to keep the organization relevant to the current generation's needs and interests. Badges vary by age group, with younger Rainbows earning awards for courage and laughter, while older Rangers can be recognized for passions like Taylor Swift or for becoming a 'booktivist.' The new additions reflect the organization's commitment to evolving while building girls' confidence and addressing contemporary issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Known as the "Battle of Orgreave," the incident saw thousands of officers confront striking miners, resulting in over 100 injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent trial against the miners collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to answer questions that have persisted for 40 years, bringing hope for justice to former miners and their communities who have long campaigned for the truth.</p>

          <p>Mezcal, a handcrafted spirit from Mexico, is stepping out of tequila's shadow to become a global phenomenon, driving a boom for family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca. Once a local drink, artisanal mezcal is now a half-billion-dollar industry, prized in high-end bars and restaurants. The report highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who returned from the U.S. to expand their family business, Mal de Amor. Their partnership with the brand Ilegal, recently acquired by Bacardi, illustrates how traditional, labor-intensive production methods are being preserved while creating economic opportunities for their community and satisfying international demand.</p>

It is being tested in 266 school districts and is designed to help with everything from homework to essay writing. A unique feature allows teachers to monitor student interactions and can flag conversations indicating emotional distress or self-harm, providing a new layer of awareness and potential intervention for student well-being, though it also raises some privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's commanding victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods, drawing frequent comparisons from peers and commentators. Since 2021, the 29-year-old has won four major championships and has shown a machine-like consistency that reminds many of Woods in his prime. While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his ability to convert leads into victories and his undisputed world number one ranking have made him the clear benchmark for his competitors. His success is attributed to a combination of mental fortitude, unorthodox but effective technique, and recent improvements in his putting game.</p>

          <p>Despite cooling economic data and a recent uptick in inflation, consumer spending in the United States continues to show resilience. Retail sales rose in June, supported by data from major banks indicating that card spending remains robust. While consumer sentiment is still below historical averages, tangible spending habits suggest a healthier reality. This economic strength is occurring alongside a labor market that is showing signs of cooling, with rising ongoing unemployment claims. The report suggests the economy is holding up for now, but recognizes growing crosscurrents and risks like trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships asserts that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that when children's feelings are dismissed, even with good intentions, it can erode their self-trust and lead to insecurity and anxiety. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence. The author suggests parents can build this skill through small shifts, such as validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self, and modeling their own emotional awareness and regulation.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has launched Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable and homeless housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. With a $300 million investment fund, the initiative seeks to attract for-profit developers by providing upfront capital, simplifying financing, and cutting construction time and costs. Better Angels is currently bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units faster and cheaper than typical affordable developments. While the rents will be higher than subsidized housing, the goal is to create a new, scalable model to address the housing crisis by letting "capitalism work."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to establish a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints about issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and environmental pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and vowed to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog, which will have legal powers to protect customers, aims to bring the water industry in line with other utilities by providing a single, powerful point of contact for disputes.</p>

          <p>Despite a dominant four-shot victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler remains humble, insisting he is not "anything special" and downplaying comparisons to Tiger Woods. After winning his fourth major, the 29-year-old reiterated that his family and faith are more important than his on-course success, which he says does not fulfill his heart's deepest desires. Scheffler, who now holds three of the four major championship titles, noted he is only a quarter of the way to Woods's major tally. He expressed gratitude for his success and shared his joy in celebrating the win with his family, including his young son, Bennett.</p>
