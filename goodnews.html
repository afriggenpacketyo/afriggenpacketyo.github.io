          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers, led by BYD, are focusing on South Korea to pursue new growth and improve profitability amid intense competition in the domestic market. This move sets up a potential clash with established native brands Hyundai and Kia. A successful entry into the South Korean market could enhance the global reputation of Chinese-made EVs, despite an anticipated export slowdown this year. BYD plans to double its showrooms in Korea by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Trump announced a trade deal that will roll back tariffs on some British exports, including autos and steel, while leaving other tariffs in place. The agreement, reached after weeks of negotiations, was described as a positive result for Starmer, though critics noted that Trump did not lift all tariffs and could potentially reverse course. The negotiations involved navigating between conventional trade negotiators and President Trump's unpredictable impulses. The deal signifies the importance of maintaining a strong relationship between the two nations despite potential challenges.</p>

          <p>Keen, a US-based footwear company, has pledged not to increase prices despite new tariffs on imports, a move that sets it apart from many other businesses. The company has been diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. Keen operates plants in the US, Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and works with manufacturing partners in other countries to spread costs. This strategy allows the company to absorb tariff-related costs without passing them on to consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal court panel ruled that Alabama's redistricting plan intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black voters, violating the Voting Rights Act. The ruling prevents the state from using the map in future elections and highlights Alabama's history of defying federal court orders. This decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court previously agreed that Alabama's 2021 congressional map discriminated against Black voters. The plaintiffs in the case are seeking to reinstate federal preclearance for future congressional districting in Alabama.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. While President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports remains in place, the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. The deal has cut car tariffs to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, with steel and aluminum tariffs scrapped. This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods, but months of negotiations and legal paperwork will follow.</p>
