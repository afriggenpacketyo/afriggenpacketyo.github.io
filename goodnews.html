          <p>The Walt Disney Company has partnered with Miral to develop a new Disney theme park and resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. This will be Disney's seventh theme park resort, with Disney's imagineers leading the creative design and operational oversight, but Disney will not be investing capital into the project. The park will feature themed accommodations, dining, and retail experiences that blend Disney storytelling with Abu Dhabi's culture. Yas Island is already a hub for entertainment and retail, hosting attractions like Ferrari World and Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an electronic warfare technology that uses networked 1-bit jammers to create the illusion of a fleet of warships, potentially tricking enemy missiles into pursuing these "ghost" fleets. This technology, detailed in the Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, aims to protect real warships by diverting enemy missiles and avoiding radar detection. The system involves four electronic warfare devices circling a ship, sending signals to deceive advanced radar systems from a distance, thus enhancing the defensive capabilities of the People's Liberation Army Navy.</p>

          <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule, suggesting that a player should only be considered offside if their entire body is beyond the last defender. Wenger compared the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup. He argues that the current use of VAR has eliminated the advantage previously given to attackers, leading to frustration, and that this adjustment would restore some of that advantage and encourage more goals.</p>
