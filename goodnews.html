          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams that claim artificial intelligence can predict questions for the national college entrance examination, known as the gaokao. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly launched a campaign to investigate and eliminate "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Scammers are selling mock papers at inflated prices, falsely claiming they use AI to predict actual questions. The government warns against these deceptive practices, which exploit the high stakes and competitive nature of the gaokao.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2bn upgrade project. Initially drawn up in 1990, the 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. Despite criticisms over its cost and duration, Welsh ministers assert the upgrade will generate jobs, opportunities, and better connect communities across the region.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has begun selling its stockpiled rice directly to retailers in an effort to lower soaring rice prices, with consumers quickly purchasing the cheaper products.

The initiative aims to address household financial pressures by making staple food more affordable, and the rice being sold is from the 2021 and 2022 harvests.</p>
