          <p>The qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marked by chaos, running twice its normal length due to a record six red flags caused by numerous driver crashes. Difficult weather conditions, including strong winds and light rain, contributed to the incidents on the notoriously challenging Baku street circuit. Title contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both made errors, failing to capitalize on opportunities and securing disappointing starting positions of seventh and ninth, respectively. The unpredictable session has set the stage for what is expected to be an eventful race with a mixed-up grid.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, saving the jobs of nearly 800 workers. The government exercised its "golden share" rights, a new power acquired as a condition of the recent takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. This national-security agreement grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. The move marks the first use of this authority and highlights the administration's increasing willingness to directly influence private sector operations to protect American jobs and industry.</p>

          <p>West Ham's head coach, Graham Potter, is facing significant job pressure following a poor start to the Premier League season, culminating in a recent home defeat to Crystal Palace. The club has reportedly begun identifying potential replacements, with names like Nuno Espirito Santo and former manager Slaven Bilic being considered. Having won just six of his 25 matches in charge, Potter's position is under intense scrutiny from both the club's board and its fans. The team has lost all three home matches this season, increasing the uncertainty surrounding the manager's future.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina resident John Saunby is building a new home from the storm's wreckage. Instead of seeing only destruction, Saunby saw potential in the debris, salvaging materials like porch posts and floorboards that were otherwise destined for a landfill. With a background in home construction, he is using the reclaimed items to create his dream house, featuring unique elements like Black Locust bark siding. This project stands as a testament to resilience and creativity in the face of natural disaster.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Player of the match Ellie Kildunne scored two decisive tries in her return from a concussion.

The Red Roses will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Allianz Stadium at Twickenham next Saturday.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to address the UK's asylum application backlog. The party's plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued that this emergency measure is necessary to quickly secure funds and resources. The goal is to reduce the costly and prolonged use of hotels to house asylum seekers while creating a more efficient and humane system.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes achieved multiple record closing highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point. This was the first rate reduction since last December, and central bankers have signaled that two more cuts could occur in 2025. The move boosted investor confidence, leading to weekly gains of approximately 1.2% for the S&P 500 and 2.2% for the Nasdaq.

          <p>In a recent interview at The Atlantic Festival, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the subject of a global scandal in 1998 to becoming an anti-bullying activist. She discussed how the cultural landscape has changed, particularly for young women in the public eye, and the importance of younger generations re-examining her story with a new perspective. Lewinsky emphasized that a key part of her healing was realizing she could not run from her past but had to find a way to reclaim her own story.

Data shows a significant increase in students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants noting a particular spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the lower cost of education overseas is a primary motivator, as median tuition in Europe can be significantly cheaper than at U.S. public universities. This trend reflects a shifting perspective on higher education among some American families.</p>
