          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 23:37:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, marking an end to four months of decline, largely fueled by strong growth in shipments to Asian markets, especially China. Despite a new trade deal, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued their significant decline, dropping 13.3%, with automobile shipments particularly affected. The recent appointment of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female Prime Minister, alongside her proposed loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, is anticipated to weaken the yen, potentially enhancing the competitiveness of Japanese goods for exporters. However, analysts caution that the rebound is partially due to a low base from the previous year, and persistent U.S.-China trade tensions continue to cloud the economic outlook.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, as confirmed by Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, following a request from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry. This deployment aims to bolster local law enforcement for major upcoming events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras, serving as a "force multiplier" for the understaffed police department. While acknowledging the need for assistance, Kirkpatrick emphasized that the Guard's role is a partnership, not an takeover, and she does not believe they should be deployed for general law enforcement outside of major events, citing their different training. Crime rates in New Orleans are currently down compared to last year.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has firmly stated that the national inquiry into grooming gangs in England and Wales will retain its precise focus and will not be "watered down," despite recent resignations from three abuse survivors. These survivors cited concerns over the inquiry's potential scope expansion to broader child sexual abuse issues and the perceived unsuitability of chairperson candidates, arguing such moves could obscure the racial and religious motivations behind their experiences. Mahmood, while regretting the resignations, affirmed that the inquiry will explicitly investigate the ethnicity and religion of offenders, emphasizing the government's commitment to the original mandate and the importance of survivor input in shaping its terms.</p>

          <p>Billy Joe Cagle, a convicted felon, faces federal charges after allegedly threatening to "shoot up" Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and subsequently arriving at the busy travel hub with an AR-15-style rifle and dozens of rounds of ammunition in his vehicle. The potential tragedy was averted thanks to the vigilance of a citizen who reported Cagle's threats, made during a FaceTime call, to the police. Law enforcement, including the Atlanta Police Department and FBI, acted swiftly to locate and take Cagle into custody at the airport's South Terminal, where his truck containing the weapon was later discovered. This incident underscores the critical importance of public awareness and rapid response in preventing acts of violence, demonstrating the success of the "See Something, Say Something" campaign.</p>

          <p>Samsung and Google have unveiled the Galaxy XR, an AI-powered mixed reality headset priced at $1,800, aiming to compete with Apple's Vision Pro. Developed with Qualcomm for its chip, the headset offers an immersive virtual computing experience with hand gesture and voice controls, heavily integrating Google's Gemini AI assistant for tasks like organizing apps and generating videos. While impressive for its AI capabilities, the device faces market challenges common to XR headsets, including high cost and a lack of "killer apps." Privacy concerns exist due to Gemini's cloud-based operation. Samsung and Google position the Galaxy XR as a stepping stone to future AI glasses, acknowledging the niche nature of current headsets.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is preparing for a significant transformation, with Terminal 5 scheduled for a complete closure on October 28 to undergo a full demolition and renovation. This extensive overhaul is a key component of a broader $30-billion modernization initiative designed to prepare LAX for the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics, promising a vastly improved airport experience. As part of this process, airlines previously operating out of Terminal 5, such as JetBlue, Spirit, and American Airlines, are being strategically relocated to other terminals, including the recently opened Midfield Satellite Concourse South, which adds substantial capacity. The project, backed by significant city council approvals, aims to enhance overall airport efficiency and passenger flow, with the rebuilt Terminal 5 expected to welcome travelers just prior to the major international event.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, along with Jared Kushner and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, is in Israel to bolster the fragile Gaza ceasefire, with Vance stating that progress is "frankly better than I expected." He emphasized the need for patience as Israel awaits the return of all hostage remains, acknowledging the difficulties in recovering bodies from rubble. Despite recent violence and an alleged RPG attack, which Israel responded to with extensive bombing, the peace process has seen incremental steps, including the return of Palestinian bodies and the release of living Israeli hostages. Vance maintains optimism that the ceasefire will hold, while stressing that no American troops will be deployed in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills "quicker and easier," introducing automatic fines of up to £20,000 for minor offenses and simplifying punishment for more serious breaches. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds aims to give the Environment Agency stronger enforcement powers, reducing the burden of proof for some offenses to a civil standard. The plans, which will undergo a public consultation, are expected to raise £50-£67 million annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers. This initiative comes after numerous reports highlighted frequent rule-breaking and the Environment Agency's previous struggles to take action against polluters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, emphasizing that no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which only a haircut can fix. They clarify that washing hair in cold water does not enhance shine, and conversely, not washing hair regularly is detrimental, as the scalp accumulates dirt and oils, leading to odor and worsened conditions like dandruff. Furthermore, dry shampoo is acceptable for occasional use between washes, but not as a substitute for regular cleansing, as prolonged use can cause scalp issues. The experts stress the importance of basic scalp care, akin to facial skincare, for overall hair health.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of 30 different antidepressants during the initial eight weeks of treatment. The research revealed significant variations, with some drugs causing weight fluctuations of up to 2kg or heart rate changes of 21 beats per minute. Academics stress these differences can be clinically important, potentially affecting patient health and adherence to medication. The article advocates for a shift towards personalized antidepressant prescriptions, matching drugs more closely to individual patient needs and existing health conditions, rather than relying on a few commonly prescribed generic options.</p>
