        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would support an interest rate cut at the Fed's next policy meeting in July, contingent on inflation pressures remaining muted. Speaking in Prague, Bowman echoed sentiments from fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to significantly impact prices, thus opening the door for lower rates. She emphasized the importance of bringing the policy rate closer to its neutral setting to sustain a healthy labor market, while closely monitoring economic conditions as administration policies and financial markets evolve. Economists had initially feared Trump's tariffs would spike inflation, but measures have shown little impact so far, and Trump has softened his stance, opening negotiations with trading partners.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay off medical or credit card debt first requires careful consideration of the distinct rules governing each type of debt. Credit card debt can quickly damage your credit score due to monthly reporting and compounding interest, while medical debt typically has a longer grace period before affecting credit. Credit card companies are also more aggressive with collections. Prioritizing credit card debt is generally recommended to protect your credit score and avoid rapidly growing balances.

Compass claims that Zillow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, aimed at hobbling competition. Zillow defends its policy as necessary to ensure fair access to listings for all buyers. Compass argues the policy harms consumer choice and protects Zillow's business model.</p>

          <p>Death Stranding 2, written and directed by Hideo Kojima, casts the player as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier who delivers essentials to isolated communities in a post-apocalyptic world. The game explores anxieties surrounding digital connectivity and computing power, questioning whether social apps and productivity tools truly bring us closer or accelerate the hollowing-out of communities. The game shows how technology, though ostensibly uniting us, often strips interactions of humanity, emphasizing the importance of physical bonds and tangible moments.</p>
