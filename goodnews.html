          <h2>Japan's Gen Z Prioritizes Work-Life Balance, Embracing 'Quiet Quitting'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are embracing the concept of 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, marking a shift from previous generations' dedication to employers. A Mynavi Career Research Lab study reveals that nearly half of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, seeking more time for hobbies, travel, and personal pursuits. This change is attributed to witnessing their parents' sacrifices for companies and a desire to avoid 'karoshi,' or death by overwork, while companies are trying to cut costs. Sociologists suggest this shift could positively impact the economy and address the country's shrinking population by encouraging leisure spending and family formation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the victory came at a cost as their pitching staff faced unexpected hurdles. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was stretched thin, with closer Tanner Scott blowing a three-run lead in the ninth. Despite these challenges, Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th inning propelled the Dodgers to victory, highlighting their resilience amidst a demanding schedule. The article emphasizes the potential future consequences for the Dodgers' pitching staff due to the heavy workload in this game.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government-held rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate consumer burden from soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores as early as June, bypassing auctions to ensure price control. The government is also exploring online sales and aims to release 300,000 tons initially, with potential for additional supplies. The average supermarket rice price reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg, nearly double last year's level, due to a poor harvest and increased demand from tourism.</p>

This trend aligns with China's strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred as the Black Hawk approached the Pentagon, leading air traffic controllers to redirect the commercial flights out of caution. The Army attributed the incident to a temporary antenna's location interfering with communication, while the FAA declined to comment due to an ongoing NTSB investigation.
