          <p>Vice President JD Vance, the first Marine to hold his office, joined service members at Camp Pendleton, California, to commemorate the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary. The event included an impressive amphibious assault demonstration and speeches from military and cabinet officials. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth delivered a fiery address, emphasizing that the Corps' strength lies in its unity of purpose and shared mission, rather than diversity, a sentiment that resonated strongly with the audience. Vance honored military heroes, reflected on his own service, and assured that the administration would fight to ensure enlisted Marines are paid, connecting the Corps' rich history to its enduring common purpose.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a newly formed Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is emerging as a key player in China's efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign chipmaking giants like ASML. Spun off from state-owned SMEE, AMIES focuses on commercializing advanced chipmaking tools more rapidly. China faces significant bottlenecks in lithography due to US export controls, restricting access to top-tier deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems. While SMEE has made progress in back-end processes, this article highlights AMIES's renewed push to catch up with global leaders in crucial front-end wafer fabrication technology.</p>

          <p>China's major airlines are increasingly offering free Wi-Fi on domestic flights to entice business travelers who have shifted to high-speed trains. China Eastern Airlines recently launched a free "basic" Wi-Fi service across all its widebody aircraft on 37 key domestic routes, following similar offerings from competitors like Air China and China Southern Airlines. This initiative aims to adapt to evolving work habits, such as "work from the air," and reclaim a segment of the market increasingly opting for the convenience and connectivity of rail travel. Initial customer feedback from test runs has been positive, indicating a potential shift in travel preferences.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen continued his strong form at the United States Grand Prix, winning the sprint race and securing pole position for the main event, further challenging McLaren's championship aspirations. This came after a collision between McLaren teammates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the sprint, which significantly impacted their points tally. McLaren boss Zak Brown acknowledged Verstappen's relentless pursuit, stating their goal is a one-two finish in the drivers' championship, not for "that Max guy getting in the middle of our fun." This article details the crash, qualifying results, and the growing concern within McLaren about Verstappen's surging performance in the latter half of the season.</p>

          <p>A container ship's journey from China to the UK via the Northern Sea Route marks a significant shift in global shipping practices, enabled by melting Arctic sea ice due to rising global temperatures. This "China-Europe Arctic Express" halves travel time compared to the Suez Canal, reducing carbon pollution but introducing new environmental and safety risks, including potential oil spills and harm to Arctic wildlife. While offering economic and geopolitical advantages for China's "Polar Silk Road" initiative, Western countries remain wary due to Russia's proximity and ecological concerns. This article highlights the profound impact of climate change on trade routes and the delicate balance between economic opportunity and environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>The Spanish town of Terrassa in Catalonia has temporarily halted black cat adoptions from animal shelters between October 6 and November 10, aiming to protect them from potential harm or use in "sinister rituals" during Halloween. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque noted a usual increase in black cat adoption requests around this period, prompting the precautionary measure despite no recorded cruelty incidents in Terrassa itself. The city council emphasized this temporary ban as an "exceptional" animal welfare precaution, acknowledging the cultural associations of black cats, which are often seen as symbols of bad luck in Western culture but good fortune elsewhere.</p>
