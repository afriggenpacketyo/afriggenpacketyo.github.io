          <p>The UK Parliament has taken a significant step towards legalizing assisted dying, with lawmakers approving a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to end their lives. The bill permits individuals aged 18 or older with a prognosis of fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval from two doctors and a review panel. Supporters argue that it provides individuals facing terminal illness with the right to end their suffering with dignity, while critics express concerns about potential pressures on vulnerable individuals. The legislation now moves to the House of Lords for further consideration, potentially marking one of the most significant social policy changes in decades.</p>

The GENIUS Act seeks to add consumer protections, collateral requirements, and regulatory oversight to the stablecoin market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan designed to significantly reduce drug review times for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." The plan aims to cut review times to one-to-two months for selected companies, focusing on areas such as addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. This initiative allows companies to submit the majority of a drug application before final clinical trial results are available, potentially streamlining the approval process. While this effort could positively impact the pharmaceutical industry by encouraging domestic manufacturing, concerns remain regarding the risks of accelerated reviews and the potential for political influence. The FDA will initially offer a limited number of vouchers to companies aligned with national health priorities.</p>
