          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, setting her on a path to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protégée of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as an effort by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses and internal turmoil. She will face significant challenges, including navigating international relations and addressing domestic economic issues amid splintered opposition parties.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon have discovered a significant thermal difference between the moon's two hemispheres. The samples, retrieved by China's Chang'e-6 mission, indicate that minerals on the far side formed in interior lava temperatures approximately 100 degrees Celsius lower than those on the near side. This finding, published in Nature Geoscience, provides crucial new insights into the moon's formation and evolutionary processes. The analysis helps to explain the long-observed asymmetries in topography, volcanic activity, and crustal structure between the two lunar faces.</p>

          <p>A forecast suggests that Social Security benefits will increase by a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, aiming to help retirees manage inflation. The article provides a chart illustrating how this adjustment would affect average monthly payments for beneficiaries aged 62 to 80. It also explains common trends in benefit amounts, noting that payments generally increase for those who delay claiming until age 70 and are higher for younger retirees due to rising lifetime wages.

          <p>Italian researchers have put forward a new theory suggesting that the iconic bronze winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated in Tang dynasty China. According to a study in the journal Antiquity, stylistic analysis and lead isotope testing indicate the statue was originally a Chinese tomb guardian beast, or zhenmushou. The researchers argue that the copper used matches ore sources from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. They also propose a fascinating theory for its journey to Europe, suggesting it may have been transported by the father and uncle of the famous explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form.</p>

          <p>A new film, "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne Johnson, chronicles the turbulent life of pioneering MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr. The project, directed by Benny Safdie, is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that unflinchingly captured Kerr's battle with opioid addiction at the height of his fame. After years of struggling with alcoholism and personal turmoil following his fighting career, Kerr is now sober and has collaborated closely with the filmmakers. Johnson's portrayal of the vulnerable yet tough fighter has received critical acclaim, offering a story of redemption and a second chance at notoriety for the retired athlete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first supermoon of 2025 is set to appear on the night of October 7th, appearing as the largest and brightest full moon of the year so far. This event, known as the Harvest Moon because it is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, will kick off a series of three straight supermoons, with others to follow in November and December. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. The Harvest Moon is particularly notable for rising near sunset for several consecutive evenings.</p>
