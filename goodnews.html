          <p>China is actively working to cultivate stronger relationships with African nations, presenting itself as a more dependable ally in the face of what it characterizes as American "bullying" under President Trump. Chinese diplomats are engaging in a charm offensive, criticizing US trade policies and urging Global South countries to unite against Washington's tariffs. Experts suggest that the former Biden administration's handling of the Gaza war and Trump's "America First" agenda have created opportunities for China to expand its influence in Africa. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has emphasized China's commitment to sharing modernization opportunities with African nations, particularly in light of the ongoing trade disputes with the United States.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a sharp decline after a significant surge, fueling speculation about potential pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the pullback, the Taiwan dollar remains up against the U.S. dollar for the year, while the U.S. dollar index is down. Experts suggest that the currency's volatility is driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt. While officials deny any formal currency talks with the U.S., analysts believe that exchange rates may be a topic in broader trade discussions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala, a major fundraising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume wing, showcased the exhibition "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," examining 300 years of Black fashion and dandyism. Despite the event's success in raising funds, the political landscape has shifted since the exhibition was announced, with the federal government targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The gala featured numerous Black designers, stylists, and celebrities, but also faced criticism regarding the Costume Institute's lack of a Black curator and the Met's history of racism. Celebrities sometimes struggle to interpret the dress code, but last night was a true celebration of Black designers, stylists and celebrities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions with the United States, China has reportedly refrained from aggressively de-dollarizing its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and it lacks viable alternatives for its foreign exchange reserves. The report also proposes that China is more likely to weaken the yuan rather than sell U.S. assets in response to trade pressures. The decision reflects a cautious approach to managing its economic interests amid ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>King Charles III unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting him in the regalia worn during the crowning ceremony. The monarch also revealed a portrait of Queen Camilla by Paul Benney, showcasing her in her silk coronation dress. The release follows the controversy surrounding the first official portrait of his reign, which drew criticism for its use of red hues. Coronation portraits have been a tradition for centuries, symbolizing the monarch's rule and legacy, with both Kuhfeld and Benney having longstanding relationships with the royal family.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing inflation concerns, certain sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing price declines, offering consumers some relief. Airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline have all seen prices decrease recently, according to the consumer price index. Experts attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors, supply-and-demand dynamics, and seasonal influences. However, the effects of tariffs threaten to disrupt this trend, potentially reversing price declines and increasing costs for consumers in the near future.</p>

Clark also said that DeepSeek‚Äôs progress should be tracked but, according to internal Anthropic tests, its models do not pose a national security risk.

          <p>A new nationwide poll reveals that over 90% of Americans use federal science information weekly, such as weather forecasts and food safety warnings, yet only 10% are concerned about potential impacts from cuts to federal science support. The poll, conducted by the Association of Science and Technology Centers, highlights a gap between usage and awareness of the source of this information. The Trump administration has made budget and personnel cuts to federal agencies that collect weather data and do safety inspections at factories that make food and prescription drugs, among many science-related functions. It also finds bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>Vector control districts in Southern California are releasing sterile male mosquitoes to combat the invasive Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is responsible for the recent surge in dengue fever. By releasing sterile males, the hope is that they will mate with females, and the resulting eggs will not hatch, reducing the mosquito population. Preliminary data from two districts shows promising results, with significant reductions in mosquito populations in release areas. While challenges remain in scaling up the intervention, officials are optimistic about this environmentally friendly approach to controlling disease-spreading pests.</p>
