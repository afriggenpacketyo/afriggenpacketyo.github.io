          <h2>Yuan Strengthens Amid Optimism for US-China Trade Thaw</h2>

          <p>The offshore yuan has experienced a surge, reaching a six-month high against the US dollar, fueled by growing optimism about a potential thaw in trade relations between the United States and China. Experts suggest that the recent gains are driven by expectations of renewed negotiations and a possible rollback of tariffs. While acknowledging the potential for volatility during negotiations, economists believe that global investors are still cautious and require tangible evidence of China's resilience before increasing their investments in Chinese assets. Despite previous tariff increases, the yuan has shown resilience, and China has been actively promoting the internationalization of its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists have presented evidence suggesting that "Shi's Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335 BC. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, which confirmed the approximate years of observations. If confirmed, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, which has been recognized as the oldest known human record of the stars until now.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow, challenging the popular association of roses with red and pink colors. The study, which involved a genomic analysis of domesticated and wild rose samples, found that the common ancestor of roses most likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, known as the queen of flowers and a symbol of love and beauty.</p>

While American companies have largely focused on proprietary AI models, Chinese firms are expanding their influence by freely distributing their models for public use. Apps like Shein, Temu, and TikTok are already among the most downloaded globally, suggesting that China is poised to dominate the next phase of the AI revolution if the US does not act to promote its own computing stack.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking has fallen to fourth among OECD members, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. While the United States remained the top donor, Japan's aid decreased due to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Japan views ODA as a key diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific, but faces fiscal challenges with its high public debt. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle Voice of America, calls for media to resist attacks on press freedom. She argues that the administration is attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA's operations because they deem it contrary to the government's agenda. Her lawsuit, backed by Reporters Without Borders and four unions, contends that the actions of the USAGM and Kari Lake violate press freedom, the First Amendment, and laws preventing executive overreach. The case highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and the media, as well as the importance of defending press freedom in the face of political pressure.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey reveals that visitors to Japan are most frustrated by the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. The issue was cited by 21.9 percent of over 4,000 foreign visitors as their top concern, requiring them to carry trash back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins in recent years is attributed to safety concerns following terror attacks. This has led to increased littering in tourist spots, prompting calls for solutions to address the inconvenience and maintain cleanliness.</p>
