          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled expiration. The judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reviewing conditions in Haiti. The ruling provides a reprieve for Haitian TPS holders, who faced the termination of their legal status and work permits. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating it "delays justice" and plans to appeal to a higher court.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. He urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which was mediated by Qatar and Egypt, stating that the terms will only get worse for them if they refuse. The proposed truce would provide a window to work towards a permanent end to the war, which has been ongoing for over 20 months. This development comes ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>U.S. men's national soccer team star Christian Pulisic has addressed his controversial decision to skip this summer's Gold Cup tournament, stating he was mentally and physically exhausted. After playing a career-high number of minutes for his club, AC Milan, he felt a break was necessary ahead of next year's World Cup. Instead of competing, Pulisic participated in an event to open a new mini soccer field for a youth club in Culver City, California. He emphasized the importance of inspiring the next generation and rediscovering the joy of the game away from professional pressures.</p>

          <p>A significant medical innovation is saving lives on the front lines in Ukraine, where surgeons are using specially designed magnetic extractors to remove shrapnel from complex wounds. The tools, developed by a volunteer team, allow for minimally invasive procedures, including removing metal fragments from beating hearts without requiring large incisions. With shrapnel wounds accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma due to drone warfare, this modernized technique has become a game-changer for front-line medicine. Over 3,000 of these uncertified but life-saving devices have been distributed to hospitals and medics across the country.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is planning the first major redesign of its banknotes in over 50 years and is asking the public for their opinions on new themes. This could mark a departure from the tradition of featuring notable historical figures on the reverse side of the notes. The Bank has suggested potential themes such as nature, innovation, arts and culture, or significant historical events. The public consultation aims to ensure the new designs serve as a collective representation of UK national identity, while also incorporating necessary security and accessibility features.</p>

          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in over 50 years, a move aimed at accelerating housing development. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, waives CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas. This change is intended to remove a major barrier that has been used to delay or block construction through lengthy studies and lawsuits. Proponents believe this will be a "game changer" for addressing the state's severe housing crisis and affordability issues.</p>
