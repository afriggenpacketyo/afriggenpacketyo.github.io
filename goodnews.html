          <p>A 39-year-old man undergoing cancer treatment shared on Reddit that he declined to travel with his brother's family, including his two picky-eating children, on a celebratory post-treatment trip to Asia. The man, wanting to experience the local food culture, felt that the children's limited diet of "beige foods" would hinder his ability to fully enjoy the trip. While he loves his niece and nephew, he expressed his desire for a unique and affordable experience focused on culinary exploration. The brother was reportedly frustrated, but the majority of Reddit users supported the man's decision, emphasizing the importance of his personal fulfillment after battling cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a significant drop of over 4% after OPEC+ members agreed to increase oil production for the month of June, marking the second consecutive month of production surges. The decision, led by Saudi Arabia, involves an additional 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling earlier forecasts by Goldman Sachs. This increase, totaling over 800,000 bpd over two months, comes amid concerns about a potential oversupply in the oil market and fears of a recession due to rising tariffs. Oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production, as major oil companies reported lower first-quarter earnings due to weaker oil prices. </p>

          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals in connection with a planned attack at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro that drew approximately two million fans. The suspects were allegedly part of a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community and seeking to recruit teenagers for attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. The police worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt the plan, which they described as a "collective challenge" to gain notoriety on social media. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of any safety concerns prior to or during the concert, which was funded by the city to revitalize the economy.</p>

          <p>Rory Truex, a China expert at Princeton University, discusses the evolution of Donald Trump's China policy, noting a shift from a potentially amicable relationship to a trade war involving aggressive rhetoric and tariffs. Truex initially suggested Trump's administration was "relatively easy" on China, but now acknowledges the escalation. He views Trump as a "proto autocrat" who initially might have sought closer ties with authoritarian leaders like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. However, the current aggressive stance suggests Trump is using tariffs as a bargaining tactic rather than seeking a broader reset of the relationship.</p>

          <p>Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* debuted at the top of the US box office with $76 million in domestic ticket sales, marking a respectable start to the summer movie season. While falling short of Marvel's typically massive launches, the film's positive reviews and audience reception suggest strong potential for continued success. The movie, featuring a team of antihero rejects, is seen as a possible "reset" for Marvel, which has struggled to consistently recapture its previous box office dominance. The film added $86.1 million in overseas sales and teases the next MCU chapter, The Fantastic Four: First Steps.</p>

A virtual safety car benefited George Russell, while Piastri controlled the race to the end, marking McLaren's first three-race win streak since 1998.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000. Home-schooled students will receive $2,000 annually. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education.

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is expected to significantly impact consumers, as cheaper goods from China become more expensive. The loophole, which allowed packages worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been a key factor for ultra-low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu. With the end of the exemption, many goods will be subject to new tariffs, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced variety for consumers. Additionally, the increased volume of packages requiring inspection could cause substantial delays in shipments, posing administrative challenges for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>
