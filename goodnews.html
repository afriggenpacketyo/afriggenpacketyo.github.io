          <h2>Markets Show Little Reaction to Potential Conflict or Ceasefire Between Iran and Israel</h2>

          <p>Global equities saw minimal gains as investors considered President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, alongside growing skepticism towards Trump's policy changes. The MSCI World index rose slightly, and U.S. futures also showed marginal increases. Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, attributed the market's muted response to a sense of weariness with Trump's policy shifts and the subdued Iranian reaction to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. Dive noted that previous tariff policy changes had a more significant impact, whereas the market's reaction has been less extreme recently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Western airlines may experience greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts this summer due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel and U.S. military strikes. Most carriers are avoiding flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes, but Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, unlike Chinese companies. Analysts suggest this may widen the competitive gap already existing between Chinese and Western airlines. Flight diversions and cancellations increased after Tehran's missile assault on a U.S. military base in Qatar, with Western firms diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, as well as southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years, listing it for ¬£5.5m. The island includes a ruined castle, a working farm, and a holiday accommodation business. The Dowager Viscountess Selby bought the island after World War II, seeking a fresh start for her family. Jim Gully, her grandson, described an idyllic childhood on the island, while Sothebys International Realty suggested the island could become a wellness destination. The castle on the island was built in 1911 by a New Zealand-born adventurer, and its blueprints are believed to have been lost on the Titanic.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after applying for 646 jobs over 18 months. She applied for two jobs a day, facing 150 rejections without feedback and no response from 271 applications. Morgan believes AI filtering processes may have hindered her initial applications, leading her to adjust her CV to be more compatible with applicant tracking systems. Despite having a degree and industry experience, she questioned the value of higher education during her extensive job search, but is now set to begin her role in London.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, potentially accelerating AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations and U.S. export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing's inherent advantages, including ultra-high speed and low power consumption, position it as a critical future direction.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil and Brent prices dropped below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran on June 13. Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions against Iran. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, enabling precautions that prevented loss of life, and called for peace.</p>
