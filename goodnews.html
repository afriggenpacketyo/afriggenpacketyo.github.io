        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision that a Louisiana law mandating the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms and state-funded universities is unconstitutional. The court affirmed that the law violates the separation of church and state, citing concerns raised by a group of parents who sued the state. Louisiana's Attorney General Liz Murrill expressed strong disagreement with the ruling and plans to seek relief from the full Fifth Circuit and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, while similar laws are under consideration in other Republican-led states. This ruling honors the religious diversity and religious-freedom rights of public school families across Louisiana.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from U.S. immigration detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel's war in Gaza. The judge stated that Khalil is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, criticizing the government's case for detention. Khalil's arrest was widely condemned as an attack on free speech, and his release follows similar rulings for other detained student activists. Khalil's immigration case will proceed separately, with the government likely to continue arguing for his deportation based on alleged omissions in his green card application, despite setbacks in court. </p>

Meta has been aggressively investing in AI, including a significant stake in Scale AI to attract key personnel like Alexandr Wang, and has also pursued acquisitions and hires from other AI firms. Bosworth emphasized Meta's belief in a future where superintelligent AI assists humans, justifying the company's substantial investments in both personnel and computing power.</p>

          <p>China has launched the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, positioning itself as a key architect of new global governance models. Beijing aims to address what it perceives as a gap in existing international mechanisms that inadequately represent the interests of developing nations. The placement of IOMed in Hong Kong signals the city's evolving role beyond a gateway to mainland China's economy, now embracing a more political function as China's bridge to the Global South. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized the need to improve the participation of developing countries and strengthen their voice in international governance.</p>
