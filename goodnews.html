          <p>Despite securing major trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing record low approval ratings, particularly among Labour voters, with many expressing unfavorable views of his leadership. While the government touts its success on trade deals, British voters remain concerned about cost-of-living pressures, exacerbated by a higher-than-expected inflation rate of 3.5% in April, and businesses grapple with tax increases. Critics suggest Starmer's lack of charisma and perceived anti-growth domestic policies are contributing to his unpopularity, despite positive developments in foreign policy, while business leaders remain optimistic about the government's overall direction. The article explores the disconnect between economic progress and public perception of the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in the UK's rail industry. The government hails this move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, although it refrained from promising lower fares. SWR trains are now under the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure pending parliamentary approval. The Transport Secretary described the nationalization of SWR as a "real watershed moment," emphasizing the government's commitment to providing passengers with "great value for money."</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's eastern entrance, including the scenic Tioga Road, will reopen on Memorial Day after being closed since November due to ice and snow. The reopening is earlier than in previous years, but cyclists will not have early access this year, leading to some disappointment. Visitors planning to enter the park during peak hours will need reservations, and limited services along Tioga Road require visitors to bring adequate supplies. Despite potential staffing shortages, park officials urge visitors to be patient and courteous.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Dog Owners' Work Stress Can Transfer to Their Pets</h2>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their canine companions. The research found that owners who frequently dwell on work problems during their free time tend to have dogs that exhibit more stress-related behaviors. This "crossover" effect highlights the emotional sensitivity of dogs to their owners' moods and changes in routines. The study suggests that employed dog owners may benefit from avoiding work-related thoughts when at home to protect the well-being of their pets.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto delivered a crucial two-run double in the fourth inning, helping the New York Mets secure a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Tony Gonsolin, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, struggled with command in the fourth, issuing consecutive walks before Soto's decisive hit. The Mets' starter, David Peterson, pitched effectively, limiting the Dodgers' offense, while the Dodgers' bullpen was strained after a long game the previous night. This win highlights Soto's potential impact on the Mets and the challenges faced by the Dodgers' pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Oliver Widger, an Oregon man known online as "sailing_with_phoenix," completed his weeks-long sailing journey from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix. After quitting his job and selling his belongings due to a health diagnosis, Widger taught himself to sail and documented his journey on social media, gaining a large following. He was welcomed by cheering fans and Hawaii's Governor Josh Green upon arrival. The scariest point of the trip came when a rudder failed, Widger said. Highlights included seeing dolphins and whales and periods of calm Pacific waters.</p>
