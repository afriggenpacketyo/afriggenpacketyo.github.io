          <h2>Taiwan More Likely to Face Economic Warfare Than Military Invasion From China, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 18:06:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A congressional hearing revealed that experts believe China is more likely to employ economic warfare or a blockade against Taiwan rather than a full-scale invasion. Mark Montgomery, a retired US rear admiral, testified that Beijing would likely target Taiwan's financial, energy, and telecommunications sectors through cyberattacks to force capitulation. While the US does not recognize Taiwan as independent, it opposes any forceful takeover and remains committed to arming the island. This assessment comes amid growing US concerns about potential Chinese aggression towards Taiwan, with some officials suggesting 2027 as a possible timeframe for action. Relevant context is the increasing military activity by the People's Liberation Army near Taiwan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a tattered copy of the Magna Carta, purchased for $27.50 in 1946, is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, according to the article. Researchers David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent authenticated the document by comparing it to other copies and using spectral imaging to reveal faded details. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace, linking it to anti-slavery campaigners. The discovery is particularly relevant now, as Harvard faces scrutiny from the government regarding its autonomy, underscoring the Magna Carta's enduring significance in individual liberty and self-governance.</p>

          <p>The State Department has confirmed that nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran are progressing constructively, with President Trump suggesting that a deal is within reach. While refraining from detailing private negotiations, Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott reiterated Trump's stance that Iran must never possess nuclear weapons and emphasized the president's desire for a diplomatic resolution. Trump, during his Middle East tour, called for Iran to cease sponsoring terror and proxy wars to achieve a deal. An advisor to Iran's supreme leader indicated Tehran's willingness to eliminate enriched uranium stockpiles and accept international supervision in exchange for the immediate lifting of economic sanctions.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator defended the company's significant capital expenditure plans, projecting $20 billion to $23 billion for the year, citing strong demand from major hyperscalers for its AI infrastructure. Intrator explained that the increased spending is driven by the need to meet critical clients' requests for faster infrastructure deployment. Despite investor concerns about the company's debt and the sustainability of AI server demand, Intrator assured that financing remains robust and that CoreWeave can repay lenders within the contract terms. CoreWeave's client list includes Microsoft and Nvidia, and it recently secured a $12 billion five-year deal with OpenAI, followed by an additional $4 billion agreement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, hindering the Trump administration's efforts to increase penalties for unlawful crossings. Chief US magistrate judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants were not aware they were entering a military zone and therefore could not be charged with trespassing. The immigrants still face charges for crossing the border illegally. This decision impacts the so-called New Mexico national defense area, established in April, where US army troops were authorized to detain immigrants entering from Mexico.</p>

The event, scheduled for June 14, has drawn criticism from Democrats, with some calling it a wasteful display of ego.

Third, the aerial fight may have been between the armed forces of Pakistan and India, but it was also the first round of a duel between Chinese and Western weapon systems.

          <p>Cava, a Mediterranean chain, reported better-than-expected sales in its latest fiscal quarter, driven by double-digit same-store sales growth of 10.8%. The company's success contrasts with the broader restaurant industry, which has experienced a slowdown in consumer spending, according to the article. Cava's CFO noted that diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual dining, contributing to the chain's positive traffic and revenue. Despite its strong performance, Cava reiterated its same-store sales forecast for the year, projecting slower growth in the back half of fiscal 2025.</p>

          <p>Canada has quietly become a global leader in digital assets due to its early adoption of crypto regulations, starting with anti-money laundering guidelines in 2014, according to the article. The regulatory clarity has made Toronto a hub for blockchain growth, attracting attention from Wall Street. Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi is a bet on Canada's established user base and projected growth in the crypto market. Other companies, like Galaxy Digital and DeFi Technologies, are also seeking listings in Canada or using it as a launchpad for U.S. expansion.</p>
