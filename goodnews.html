          <p>The World Trade Organization has revised its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 upward to 2.4%, citing strong performance in the first half of the year driven by AI-related demand and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the outlook for the following year is less optimistic, with the 2026 growth projection significantly reduced to just 0.5%. The WTO attributes the expected slowdown to the cooling global economy and the cumulative impact of trade tariffs. The report highlights Asia's dominant role in the expansion of AI-related trade, while noting that ongoing trade restrictions pose a key risk to future growth.</p>

At the time of the announcement, the storm was located over 1,300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands and posed no immediate threat to land. Jerry is tracking westward with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. Forecasters have indicated that tropical storm watches may become necessary for the islands as the system continues its approach across the open ocean.</p>

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised technology, an announcement that comes as the company teases a more significant reveal. Recent social media clips from the automaker have fueled intense speculation among investors that a long-awaited, lower-cost model or the next-generation Roadster could be unveiled. This strategic move aims to shift focus towards Tesla's future in robotics and autonomous driving, especially as the company faces a slump in auto sales due to an aging product line and increased competition. The anticipation has driven a recent surge in the company's stock price.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has purchased additional shares of GE Vernova, expressing strong conviction in the company's long-term prospects. The investment thesis is heavily tied to the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, which requires vast amounts of energy for data centers, positioning GE Vernova as a key supplier of power generation technology. Despite acknowledging softness in the company's onshore wind business, the club views the stock as a prime story in the current market. The move reflects a belief that the demand for power to fuel AI will be a significant growth driver. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The estate of Michael Bond and the producers of the Paddington films have filed a lawsuit against Avalon, the company behind the satirical puppet show "Spitting Image." The High Court complaint cites copyright and design right infringements following the release of a YouTube show depicting Paddington Bear as a foul-mouthed podcast host. In the parody, the beloved children's character is shown swearing, advertising guns, and admitting to drug use. This portrayal starkly contrasts with the gentle, well-mannered bear known to generations, prompting the creators to take legal action to protect the character's integrity.</p>

          <h2>Germany Debates Federal vs. State Responsibility for Drone Defense After Airport Disruptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent drone sightings that twice suspended flights at Munich Airport, a debate has emerged within the German government over which level of authority is responsible for drone defense. Conservative politicians are questioning whether the federal government or the individual states should lead efforts to protect critical infrastructure. The German military is constitutionally barred from engaging domestic threats, leaving the responsibility to police forces that lack the necessary equipment to counter drones effectively. This has prompted calls for a clearer division of powers to address the growing security challenge posed by unauthorized drone activity.</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed by more than 225% following a White House announcement that the U.S. government will take a 10% stake in the company. The partnership, which includes a $35.6 million investment, is part of a federal initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc. The investment aims to unlock resources in Alaska's Ambler mining district by reversing a previous administration's rejection of a key industrial road project. This move highlights a renewed federal focus on responsible resource development to support energy, defense, and manufacturing needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the S&P 500 continuing to set record highs, some financial experts are cautioning investors against over-reliance on the popular index for diversification. They argue that because the index is market-capitalization-weighted, it has become heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, creating a false sense of safety. This concentration means poor performance by a handful of stocks can significantly drag down the entire index. To mitigate this risk, advisors suggest broadening investment exposure to include small- and mid-cap stocks, international markets, and other asset classes to create a more balanced and resilient portfolio.

          <p>The Pentagon has authorized the U.S. Navy to proceed with selecting a defense contractor to design and build its next-generation stealth fighter, known as the F/A-XX. This multi-billion dollar program is considered crucial for countering China's rapidly modernizing military and will replace the Navy's aging F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet. The decision, made by the Defense Secretary, moves the program forward after months of delays caused by a funding dispute between the Pentagon and Congress. Boeing and Northrop Grumman are the two companies competing for the contract to produce the advanced carrier-based aircraft.</p>

          <h2>Surge in Private Capital Allows Startups to Delay Public Offerings for Longer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:14:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals a significant trend of startups remaining private for extended periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This shift is largely attributed to the massive influx of alternative capital from sources like private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds. With over $12 trillion in private equity assets globally, startups have ample access to funding without the regulatory burdens and short-term pressures of public markets. This allows companies to mature and achieve much larger revenues before an IPO, fundamentally changing the landscape for both private and public investors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents across the United Kingdom have been reporting an unusual number of ladybirds swarming in and around their homes. Wildlife experts explain that this is a normal seasonal behavior, as the insects take advantage of recent warm, sunny weather to find sheltered places to hibernate for the winter. The population of ladybirds, particularly the invasive harlequin species, was boosted by a record-warm spring and summer, which led to a surge in aphids, their primary food source. While the sight of large clusters can be surprising, it is a natural phenomenon driven by the insects' need to survive the colder months.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has proposed the creation of a global, AI-powered satellite mega-constellation designed to be open and shared among all nations. The project, named OSSMC, is presented as a solution to two major challenges: the increasing crowding of low Earth orbit and the need for equitable access to space resources. With over a million satellites already filed for launch worldwide, primarily by private companies like SpaceX, the proposal aims to offer a collaborative alternative. The project's lead scientist framed it as a "China solution" for building a shared future for humanity in space systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between traditional pretax and after-tax Roth 401(k) contributions, many people mistakenly compare their current marginal tax rate with their expected future marginal rate. A more accurate approach is to compare your current marginal rate with your potential effective tax rate in retirement, which is often much lower. Because of the progressive tax system and standard deductions, your effective rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of gross income—can be significantly less than your top bracket rate. This calculation may reveal that pretax contributions are more advantageous than commonly assumed. (not investment advice)</p>
