          <p>Prince Harry has lost his bid to reinstate automatic taxpayer-funded police protection during visits to the United Kingdom. A judge ruled that his security situation will remain as is, with state-funded police protection provided on a case-by-case basis.

          <p>The new Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, starring Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, offers an enjoyable experience within the MCU. The film centers on a team of morally gray antiheroes navigating a world that is losing faith in traditional superheroes. Directed by Jake Schreier, Thunderbolts* leans into the relative anonymity of its ensemble cast, which includes Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, and David Harbour. The plot involves a conspiracy surrounding Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, and the action is characterized by hand-to-hand combat rather than the usual CGI-heavy spectacle. Optimism score is 75.</p>
