          <p>Myles Garrett, the Cleveland Browns' star defensive end, was absent from voluntary OTAs this week, sparking relationship rumors with Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim after they appeared together at an anime awards show in Tokyo. Garrett had previously requested a trade before signing a record extension in March, citing a desire to win. While OTAs are not mandatory and head coach Kevin Stefanski dismissed his absence, it raised eyebrows given Garrett's earlier commitment to being the best leader possible. Garrett has also posted on his Instagram story that he was "tryna buy a place here asap."</p>

          <p>China is reportedly developing a rapid-response space defense system to protect its Tiangong space station from potentially interfering spacecraft. According to scientist Sun Zhibin, the system involves deploying small robotic thrusters to latch onto and redirect suspicious objects approaching the station. This development follows China's report to the United Nations about evasive maneuvers the Tiangong station had to perform to avoid collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites. The robotic thrusters would allow China to respond to close approaches by other spacecraft after assessing their intent.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, as the company's artificial intelligence chips are in high demand.

          <p>Financial experts advise new college graduates to begin saving for retirement early, emphasizing the benefits of compound interest and long-term market participation. Setting-it-and-forgetting-it is a key strategy, focusing on time in the market rather than timing the market. Investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes is recommended. A mix of stocks and bonds is suggested, with a higher allocation to stocks for younger investors. It is important to understand risk tolerance and avoid making emotional investment decisions.
