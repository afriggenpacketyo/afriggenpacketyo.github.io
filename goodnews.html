          <p>The focus of international space exploration is increasingly shifting from the Moon to Mars, with the former now often viewed as a strategic stepping stone. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar objectives, including a planned human habitat, the long-term goal for many agencies is Martian colonization. Nations like China and the European Space Agency have set ambitious timelines for sending humans to the red planet, viewing its more Earth-like conditions as a viable option for sustained presence. This new space race involves more global players than the original, with private companies also playing a significant role in lunar logistics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait are strengthening their military relationship, highlighted by the upcoming inauguration of a joint ammunition factory. The facility, which will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, marks a significant milestone in the defense cooperation between the two nations. Kuwait's deputy minister of defence confirmed the project's imminent launch during a reception at the Chinese embassy. Military ties, which began with a cooperation agreement in 1995, have steadily advanced, with plans to expand joint training programs. This partnership reflects Beijing's increasing engagement and influence in the Gulf region, even with key U.S. allies like Kuwait.</p>

Lance, competing for a backup role, threw for 120 yards and two touchdowns, showcasing the potential that made him a former No. 3 overall draft pick. The game, which serves as the traditional start to the NFL preseason, also included a moment of silence for the victims of a recent shooting that targeted the league's headquarters. Many starters for both teams, including Justin Herbert and Jared Goff, were rested for the exhibition match.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, some of whom have lived legally in the U.S. for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was 'preordained' and potentially motivated by racial animus, without a full consideration of current conditions in those countries. The planned terminations are now postponed until at least November, pending a further hearing.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's handling of its emergency docket, which has seen a surge in appeals from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, it is inevitable that courts will be called upon to rule on their legality. He noted that the court has increased its procedural rigor in these cases, sometimes scheduling emergency oral arguments. Kavanaugh emphasized that despite disagreements, the collegiality among the justices remains strong and that criticism is an expected part of the job for judges.</p>

AWS remains the market leader and a major profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income for the quarter. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the division's significant market share and emphasized its focus on security, while also acknowledging that supply shortages for AI infrastructure, particularly power, remain a challenge.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million ballroom, a project President Trump has labeled his 'gift to the country.' The 90,000-square-foot facility, designed to hold up to 650 guests, will be built in place of the current East Wing and is intended to provide a permanent venue for large-scale events, which currently require tents on the South Lawn. According to the White House, the project will be funded by President Trump and other 'patriot donors.' This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion itself since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a stunning debut on the New York Stock Exchange, with its stock soaring 250% on the first day of trading. The successful IPO has created approximately $24 billion in paper wealth for its four primary venture capital backers: Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. The offering is a major win for Silicon Valley's venture capital ecosystem, which has seen a slow IPO market in recent years. Figma's market capitalization closed at nearly $68 billion, more than triple the $20 billion Adobe had offered to acquire the company for in a deal that ultimately collapsed due to regulatory pressure.</p>
