          <p>Hurricane Iona has become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean, rapidly intensifying from a tropical storm. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located hundreds of miles southeast of Honolulu and is not expected to pose a direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters anticipate Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening as it moves westward over the next few days. The storm follows several others in the eastern Pacific, highlighting an active hurricane season in the region.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has disclosed that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer, which required surgery to remove his bladder. Despite the serious health challenge, his oncologist now considers him cured, and Sanders has affirmed his intention to coach the team this season. The 57-year-old coach, who has previously dealt with significant health issues including foot surgeries and blood clots, shared the news to address recent absences.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market is demonstrating significant strength, highlighted by Paris Hilton and Carter Reum's recent $63 million purchase of a Beverly Hills mansion. This sale, along with several other multi-million dollar deals, has positioned California at the forefront of the nation's most expensive home sales for the month. Real estate agents attribute the robust market to demand from buyers displaced by wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China. The activity suggests a continuing trend of high-value transactions in exclusive neighborhoods like Beverly Hills and Bel Air.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has presented a new European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal, developed in collaboration with France and Germany, aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. This initiative follows the breakdown of U.S.-led talks and comes amid increasing international pressure for action, including calls for the UK to recognize Palestinian statehood. President Trump indicated his immediate focus is on humanitarian aid, stating, "we want to get the children fed."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide for services funded by Medicaid. The order blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by ending its Medicaid payments for one year. Judge Indira Talwani's ruling stated that restricting these funds would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing the funding would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting over a million patients.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently seen a modest decline, offering a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners compared to high-rate credit cards. With average rates for both products now around 8.25%, prospective borrowers are advised to act strategically. Homeowners should carefully compare the features of fixed-rate loans versus variable-rate lines of credit to see which fits their needs. It is also recommended to shop around for the best offers and to determine the precise amount needed to avoid over-borrowing against their home's equity. (not investment advice)</p>

Healy warned that without these "seed" venues, where iconic artists like Amy Winehouse and The Smiths began their careers, the pipeline for new talent could dry up. The festival will see over 1,000 pubs and bars host music events to highlight the vital role these small stages play in the cultural ecosystem.

          <p>For individuals reducing their red meat consumption, health experts recommend numerous alternative sources to ensure adequate iron intake. Research has linked high red meat consumption to health risks like Type 2 diabetes, while iron deficiency remains a common issue. Registered dietitians suggest iron-rich foods such as lentils, beans, tofu, and spinach, as well as seafood options like oysters and clams. To improve the body's absorption of iron from plant-based sources, it is beneficial to pair them with foods high in vitamin C. Fortified breads and cereals are also a major source of dietary iron.</p>
