          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed normal operations after a significant IT outage caused a system-wide ground stop for all its flights for approximately three hours. The airline apologized to customers for the inconvenience and warned of residual impacts on its flight schedule throughout the evening. On Monday, the carrier clarified that the disruption was caused by an unexpected failure of a critical third-party hardware component at its data centers. It emphasized that the issue was not the result of a cybersecurity incident and that the safety of its flights was never compromised during the outage.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has appointed George Tidmarsh, a former biotech executive and adjunct professor at Stanford, as its new director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Tidmarsh will lead the crucial division responsible for reviewing most new drug applications, a role that has come under scrutiny during the current administration. His appointment comes amid significant upheaval at the FDA, but his extensive industry experience is seen as a potential reassurance for the pharmaceutical sector. Tidmarsh has previously criticized certain regulatory decisions, suggesting he may adopt a more stringent approach to drug approvals.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group, allowing the All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site to move forward. The expansion, which includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium, had been approved by the Greater London Authority but faced opposition over the use of protected parkland. The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, argued the development was unlawful, but the judge ruled the planning authority's decision was a rationally exercised judgment. The All England Club expressed delight with the ruling, while the opposition group may seek to appeal.</p>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson is set to play his first Test match for England in eight years, having been named in the team for the upcoming game against India at Old Trafford. The 35-year-old left-armer returns to the side as a replacement for the injured Shoaib Bashir, marking a significant comeback after a long absence from the Test arena. Dawson's selection is seen as a move to add experience and guile to the spin attack, while also strengthening the lower-order batting. England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and can secure a series victory with a win in Manchester.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave climbed over 7% after the company announced its intention to sell $1.5 billion in bonds. The capital raised from the debt offering, with notes due in 2031, will be allocated for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt. This move follows a previous successful $2 billion debt offering in May that was reportedly five times oversubscribed, signaling strong investor confidence. Since its Nasdaq debut in March, CoreWeave's stock has more than tripled, although some investors have raised concerns about the company's debt levels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, a significant development gap persists between western nations and those in the east. Experts suggest that a combination of cultural norms, historical political factors, and a lack of investment have held the sport back in many eastern and southern European countries. Even with recent UEFA initiatives and increased budgets, societal views that football is a 'man's game' and the legacy of post-communist economic struggles present ongoing challenges. However, the high visibility of major tournaments is slowly shifting perceptions and creating hope for future growth in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has warned that the future of public service media is at risk and has urged YouTube to give more prominence to content from broadcasters like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4. The recommendation comes as children now spend significantly more time on YouTube than watching all public service channels combined. Ofcom's report suggests that broadcasters must work with YouTube to ensure their material is easy to find, and it raises the possibility of government legislation to enforce this. The goal is to prevent a generational disconnect from public service content, which is crucial for delivering impartial news and UK-centric programming.</p>

          <p>Prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi, who was arrested and initially accused of facilitating terrorist acts, has been freed on bond after facing lesser charges. In court, he was charged with unlawful possession of ammunition and noxious substances, stemming from his alleged role in recent anti-government protests. The dropping of the more severe terrorism charge was a relief to his supporters, who had packed the courtroom in Nairobi. After his release, Mwangi addressed the crowd, stating that the government is scared of young people who are self-organizing to demand better conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a string of recent high-profile incidents, this article examines the complex and unending challenge airports face in preventing bird-plane collisions. At major hubs like Boston's Logan International Airport, a dedicated team uses a variety of methods, including pyrotechnics, habitat modification, and, as a last resort, lethal removal to keep wildlife away from runways. The task is daunting, as airports are often located in areas naturally attractive to birds, such as coastlines. Despite these extensive efforts, officials acknowledge that bird strikes are an inevitable risk that can only be mitigated, not completely eliminated.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is making a historic change to its business model by ending its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seats set to launch on January 27. This move, part of a major overhaul to generate new revenue, will replace the iconic A-B-C boarding groups with an eight-group system based on elite status, fare type, and seat location. The airline has been reconfiguring its aircraft to include extra-legroom seats, which will be available for purchase. The change marks a significant departure from the policies that have differentiated Southwest from its competitors for over half a century.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the surprising but sometimes necessary practice of applying sunscreen to animals to protect them from sun damage. Zookeepers and veterinarians have used sunblock on creatures ranging from elephants and pigs to light-colored domestic pets like dogs and cats, which are susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer. The challenge is often a human-created one, as selective breeding has produced animals with lighter skin and fur than their wild ancestors. While applying sunscreen to a reluctant animal can be difficult, it is sometimes the only practical alternative to keeping them indoors or wrestling them into full-body sunsuits.</p>

          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced the discovery of a sandstone-type uranium deposit at a new record depth, marking a significant breakthrough in the country's resource exploration technology. This type of deposit is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine, which could bolster China's domestic uranium supply. The discovery is a key development for China, which is heavily reliant on imports to fuel its growing nuclear power sector and maintain its nuclear weapons program. The advance in deep-earth exploration reflects China's strategic push to enhance its energy security and resource independence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to leadership expert Jennifer Schielke, bosses who rely on flattery to be liked by their employees are using an ineffective and insecure tactic. She argues that insincere compliments can come across as manipulative and do not build genuine connections or respect within a team. Instead of excessive praise, effective leaders should focus on authentic appreciation, kindness, and investing in their employees' needs and perspectives. Building a positive workplace culture through genuine interaction and addressing both positive and negative issues directly is a far more successful approach than trying to win a popularity contest.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. The company plans to differentiate itself from other crypto proxies by not just holding ether, but by actively generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues this makes ether a more 'productive' asset than bitcoin and that existing ether ETFs do not currently offer this yield-generating capability. The company's debut comes as institutional interest in ether and tokenization grows. (not investment advice)</p>
