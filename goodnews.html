        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage interest rate has climbed above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to concerns about rising government debt. This is the first time since April 11 that rates have exceeded this threshold, impacting aspiring homebuyers who are already facing high home prices and a limited supply of affordable properties. While markets initially reacted negatively to the downgrade, stock and bond prices recovered later in the day. Experts suggest that the nation's debt issues were already factored into investor sentiment, leading to a limited long-term market impact. ()</p>

          <p>A luxury Boeing 747 gifted to the U.S. government by Qatar is currently stationed in San Antonio, Texas, awaiting a specialized overhaul to potentially serve as the next Air Force One. Ethical, legal, political, and security concerns have been raised regarding the acceptance of this gift, valued at $400 million. Experts caution that the retrofitting process could take several years, and any shortcuts could compromise national security, lacking essential features like encrypted communications and electronic warfare systems. While Trump said he would not use the plane after he leaves office, he wants to park it in his presidential library one day. ()</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The decision declares the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Trump advisor Elon Musk, as "null and void." The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and criticizes the administration's use of force and threats to seize the USIP headquarters. Judge Howell emphasized that USIP is an independent think tank supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, and the President's removal of board members was unconstitutional. ()</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has advocated for a new law that criminalizes the posting of "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content online, citing the need to protect children from harmful online behavior. The Take It Down Act mandates technology companies to remove such content within 48 hours, with violators facing up to three years in prison. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups express concerns that it could lead to censorship of legitimate content and undermine encryption. The First Lady describes the law as a significant victory in protecting Americans, especially young people, from online exploitation. ()</p>

          <p>Mohamed Salah's quest to break the Premier League's goal involvement record continues after missing a crucial opportunity in Liverpool's defeat at Brighton. Despite his 400th appearance for Liverpool, Salah failed to capitalize on a clear chance, leaving him one goal involvement short of the record. After a strong start to the season, his recent form has seen a decline, with only one goal and one assist in the last eight matches. With one game remaining, Salah still has a chance to achieve the record. ()</p>
