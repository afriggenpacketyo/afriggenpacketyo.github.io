        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries reveals that parents generally experience a greater sense of meaning in life compared to individuals without children, however, they also report lower levels of life satisfaction. This difference is particularly pronounced for mothers and varies significantly depending on the country's family policies and gender equality. Scandinavian countries, known for their robust childcare support and gender equality, show smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents. The study highlights the importance of societal support in alleviating the challenges faced by parents and recognizing children as a shared responsibility.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has expressed support for the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Despite the potential impact on medal prospects, Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa cited concerns about injuries among younger athletes as a reason for endorsing the change. While some of Japan's previous Olympic medalists would have been ineligible under the new rule, the country welcomes the restriction to protect the physical well-being of child athletes.

The revised law introduces tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues.
