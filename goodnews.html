          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered a large, well-preserved ancient Native American agricultural site in northern Michigan, revealing extensive farming practices from centuries before European colonization. Using drone-mounted laser technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, remnants of raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of the agricultural system is surprising, especially given the region's challenging growing conditions and the presence of wild rice. The discovery highlights the advanced agricultural knowledge and practices of Native American communities and suggests that similar sites may be found in other undisturbed forested areas.</p>

Topol also recommends specific medical tests, such as Polygenic Risk Scores and DEXA scans, to personalize medical care and flag potential disease risks.

          <p>After a two-year shutdown, recreational salmon fishing is resuming in California under strict limits to help the population recover. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is limiting ocean fishing under quotas in two windows in the summer and fall. The first is set to open Saturday-Sunday and allow for up to 7,000 salmon to be caught statewide. The fishing industry depends on fall-run Chinook, which migrate upstream to spawn from July through December, and officials hope to see "responsible water management" where state officials prioritize river flows for fish, as well as efforts to restore floodplains and improve hatchery operations.</p>
