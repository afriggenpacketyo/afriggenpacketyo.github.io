          <p>Joseph McNeil, one of the four Black college students who initiated the landmark 1960 Greensboro lunch counter sit-in, has passed away at the age of 83. Their nonviolent protest at a segregated Woolworth's counter sparked a wave of similar demonstrations across the American South, becoming a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. The protest helped lead to the desegregation of the Greensboro counter within six months and contributed to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. McNeil later served in the Air Force, retiring as a two-star major general, and is remembered for his courage and conviction.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after serving nearly three decades for a murder he did not commit. His 1998 conviction was vacated after a key trial witness recanted her testimony and confessed to the crime herself. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release, acknowledging the conviction was tainted by false evidence. Hooper's case highlights a significant miscarriage of justice, and he has now been reunited with his family. The woman who confessed is currently imprisoned in Georgia for a separate crime.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson has confirmed that former President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery, a common procedure for treating skin cancer. This follows a previous procedure in 2023 where a basal cell carcinoma was removed from his chest. Before his presidency, Biden had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed using the same surgical technique. The news comes after he was seen with a bandage on his head, and it is part of his ongoing dermatologic surveillance. His health has been a topic of public interest, especially following his recent diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, suggested that businesses are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. While acknowledging the consumer appeal of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously, he warned that their need for user credentials and autonomy is "at odds with the enterprise." Arora predicted that companies would block such browsers within two years unless they are designed with enterprise security and credential management in mind. He highlighted the importance of identity security, noting that his company's planned acquisition of CyberArk addresses the critical issue of credential theft in corporate breaches.</p>

          <p>New York City has opened a first-of-its-kind high school in Queens designed to prepare students for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The HBCU Early College Prep school aims to increase exposure to HBCUs, which are not present in the northeastern U.S. north of Pennsylvania. The school, which received over 1,000 applications for 100 seats, will partner with Delaware State University (DSU), allowing students to earn up to 64 college credits and an associate's degree. Officials emphasized that the school, like HBCUs, is open to students of all backgrounds and is dedicated to academic excellence and social justice.</p>

          <p>Jorma Taccone, a member of the comedy group The Lonely Island and a "Saturday Night Live" alum, is facing a long recovery after shattering his pelvis in a 20-foot fall from a ladder. The accident occurred at his Connecticut farmhouse while he was hanging lights on a barn. Taccone recounted the frightening incident on a podcast with his colleagues, stating he had enough time while falling to think he was going to die. Doctors expect him to be able to walk again within three to six months, and his co-hosts expressed their relief that his injuries were not fatal.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," a raw and unflinching account of her relationship with her formidable mother, Mary Roy. The book portrays Mary Roy as a complex figure: a feminist icon, educator, and crusader who was also a mercurial and challenging presence in her daughter's life. Roy describes their bond as a "respectful relationship between two nuclear powers," shaped by a turbulent upbringing that she says made her the writer she is today. The memoir is not a hagiography but a "reportage of the heart," exploring a bruising yet ultimately life-affirming connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a purely financial and strategic one "based on mathematics." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the money saved from Parsons' contract, combined with the value of the draft picks received in the trade, would allow the Cowboys to pay for approximately five top-tier players. He emphasized that the move was not personal but an opportunity to spread compensation across more players, potentially improving team-wide availability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a maximum temperature of 82 degrees. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes as climate change increases the frequency of dangerous heat waves. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased deaths and hospitalizations, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. The Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles opposes the measure, citing concerns about the high costs of implementation and potential rent increases.</p>

Her recent White House event on AI in education, attended by tech industry leaders, further signals her focus on using her platform to address emerging technological challenges.

          <p>With home equity levels at record highs and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, homeowners may be considering a home equity loan. The article advises asking several key questions before proceeding, such as accurately determining how much equity is available to borrow and whether the financial need is urgent enough to justify current interest rates. Homeowners should also weigh the benefits of borrowing now against the possibility of securing lower rates in the future. The decision requires careful consideration of personal financial needs and the potential for future market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend could challenge China's efforts to promote the yuan and reduce reliance on the dollar.

His time in charge was marked by significant business success, including the development of a new billion-pound stadium and consistent European qualification, but was also defined by a lack of major trophies and frequent fan protests. Sources suggest the club's ownership decided a change was needed to achieve greater sporting success. Levy's departure comes after a recent Europa League win, and he will be replaced by a new leadership structure, with Peter Charrington becoming non-executive chairman.</p>
