          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to increase the defense spending goal to 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous target of 2%. President Trump praised the new agreement as a "monumental win for the United States," as he has repeatedly demanded that NATO allies boost their defense spending. In 2024, NATO member countries spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of the 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez stated his country will not meet the 5% defense spending goal, calling the 2% target "sufficient" and "realistic."</p>

          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno have become first-time homeowners by building their own homes through the Mutual Self-Help Housing (MSHH) program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to collectively build homes, offering training and supervision. The project represents a $1.46 million investment by the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis and promote homeownership in a historically underserved community. The families invested their time and energy in tasks such as pouring foundations, framing walls, and wiring, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and community.</p>

Micron anticipates revenue in the current period to be approximately $10.7 billion, up 38% from the previous year and exceeding the average analyst estimate of $9.9 billion.

          <p>Industry insiders at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin stated that Chinese companies should relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems to solidify their overseas expansions. Amid rising uncertainty over global trade, particularly with the potential for higher tariffs in the second term of US President Donald Trump, Chinese companies are looking to strengthen their supply chain resilience. This involves building factories in new markets, either for export or local sale, to avoid tariffs. Manufacturers began relocating their supply chains overseas during Trump‚Äôs first term, building plants in Southeast Asia and expanding to countries like Mexico and Morocco.</p>

The agency is reopening the claims submission process for gamers eligible under a $245 million settlement with Epic Games, due to deceptive online practices that tricked players into unauthorized purchases. The FTC will send nearly 970,000 checks and PayPal payments to consumers who filed a valid claim, with a deadline extension to July 9 for new claims. A claim number or Epic Account ID is required to apply, and a parent or guardian must apply on behalf of those under 18.</p>

          <p>The FHFA has issued a directive ordering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to formally consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This marks a shift in the U.S. housing finance system, signaling a new era of crypto integration into traditional financial infrastructure. The order directs both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to a loan closing. Director Pulte stated that the move aligns with President Trump's vision "to make the United States the crypto capital of the world."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing money to build EV chargers in 14 states, challenging the administration's freeze on the funds. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, requiring the Department of Transportation to release the funds allocated by Congress for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The states argued that the freeze disrupted ongoing projects and hampered their ability to meet carbon emission targets. The judge emphasized the separation of powers, noting that Congress has the power of the purse and the executive branch must administer spending accordingly.</p>
