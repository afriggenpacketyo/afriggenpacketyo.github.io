          <h2>Study Shows Ancient Horses Migrated Between Asia and North America</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has revealed that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene era. This migration was made possible by a land bridge that connected the two continents when sea levels were lower. The study examined fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These migrations and genetic exchanges occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, highlighting the interconnectedness of these horse populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their political views. Conservatives suing the Biden administration often file cases in small Texas courts with Republican appointees, while challenges to the Trump administration have landed in Massachusetts, the bluest district in the 1st Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction, impacting cases such as Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services (H.H.S.) has announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines, including those for seasonal strain changes, may qualify as "new products" requiring additional clinical evaluation. This could impact both COVID and flu vaccines, with the FDA already requesting more clinical data from Novavax. Some officials are also questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12, raising concerns about potential restrictions on vaccine availability.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates and the United States have signed an agreement for the UAE to build the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the United States, granting expanded access to advanced AI chips. This deal, made during Donald Trump‚Äôs visit to the Middle East, has raised concerns because it would have faced restrictions under the previous administration due to fears that China could access the technology. The Trump administration believes the chips can be managed securely, but some worry that the deal could diminish U.S. dominance in AI.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are set to debate an assisted dying bill again after major changes were made to it. The bill passed the first stage of the Commons last November, but since then, the details have been scrutinized and dozens of amendments added by both sides. A vote to pass or reject the bill is not likely to take place on Friday, but rather in June. Friday's debate comes as the government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>
