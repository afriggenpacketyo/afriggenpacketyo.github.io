          <p>Maro Itoje, the newly appointed captain of the British and Irish Lions rugby team, is preparing for the upcoming tour of Australia with a focus that extends beyond the pitch. In a recent interview, he discussed the importance of his Christian faith in providing humility and perspective, describing it as a core part of his daily routine. Itoje also spoke about his "portfolio existence," which includes founding an art gallery focused on African art, running a charity, and maintaining a keen interest in politics.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Determining how much money is needed for retirement is a complex question, as individual needs vary greatly. A new analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown explores different adequacy measures, including fixed "pounds and pence" benchmarks like the Living Pension and relative measures like target replacement rates. The research concludes that relative measures, which are based on a percentage of pre-retirement income, provide a more personalized and realistic goal for most people, especially higher earners. However, it also stresses the importance of a minimum income floor to ensure everyone can meet basic needs in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pakistan has taken on the one-month rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council, its first time in the role since 2013. The position is largely symbolic but comes at a time of significant global instability and heightened tensions, particularly with neighboring India over the Kashmir region. Pakistan's UN ambassador stated the country would work cooperatively to promote peaceful conflict resolution in line with the UN Charter. The presidency provides a platform for Pakistan to raise key issues, while India is reportedly preparing a strategy to counter Islamabad's agenda.</p>

          <p>Despite France's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, its colonial history remains largely invisible in its national cinema, with audiences often relying on American films for depictions of slavery. The author notes a recent shift with new films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on anti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon, which are finally telling these stories from a French perspective. However, these films still struggle for mainstream recognition and are often marginalized at major festivals like Cannes. The article argues that while filmmakers and audiences are ready to confront this history, the industry has been slow to adapt.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has strengthened to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since last November, with its appreciation expected to continue through 2025. This trend is supported by China's resilient macroeconomic data, which has been better than feared, particularly in exports. Concurrently, growing concerns over the sustainability of U.S. government debt and its fiscal policies are contributing to a weaker outlook for the dollar. Investment bank Goldman Sachs forecasts the yuan will break the 7 per dollar mark within six months and reach 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more widespread, it is crucial for nations, particularly in emerging economies, to develop their own "sovereign AI" capabilities. At a recent tech conference, panelists argued that countries need to control their own AI technologies and data to meet unique cultural, linguistic, and security needs, rather than relying on English-centric models from major tech companies. They identified open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services as key tools to democratize AI. This approach would allow regions like Southeast Asia to leverage local talent and create technology beneficial for their entire populations.</p>

          <p>A private survey of Chinese manufacturing showed an unexpected return to growth in June, providing a positive signal for the world's second-largest economy. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely driven by improved production and new orders. This result contrasts with the official government PMI, which indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey samples and timing. Despite the upbeat data, challenges remain, including weak export orders and cautious hiring among businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has passed what Governor Gavin Newsom called "transformative" housing legislation aimed at speeding up construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new laws, pushed through by the governor, exempt most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews, a process that has often stalled development for years. The move sidestepped some demands from powerful labor unions and was forced through by tying its passage to the state budget. Proponents believe this is one of the most significant reforms to CEQA in its history and will unlock numerous stalled housing projects.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has agreed to scrap its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies following pressure from the Trump administration. The White House, which had labeled the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened retaliatory tariffs, claimed victory, stating that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to President Trump. Canadian officials framed the decision as part of a broader trade negotiation, which has now resumed between the two countries. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon and Google and was intended to address how multinational tech firms are taxed on Canadian revenue.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers along the coast of northern and central Portugal were treated to a rare and spectacular weather phenomenon on Sunday. A massive, tube-shaped cloud, known as a "roll cloud," was seen stretching across the sky. This type of low, horizontal cloud formation is uncommon and typically forms along the leading edge of a cold front or sea breeze. The stunning visual occurred as Portugal, like much of Europe, has been experiencing a significant heatwave, drawing many people to the coast where they witnessed the unusual sight.</p>
