          <h2>The Evolution of 'Lavender Marriages' from LGBTQ+ Cover to Modern Social Trend</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "lavender marriage," once a historical necessity for LGBTQ+ individuals in early Hollywood to conceal their orientation, is being reinterpreted by younger generations on TikTok. Originally, these marriages of convenience provided a heteronormative cover in eras when homosexuality was criminalized. Today, the trend reflects a modern desire for platonic partnerships that offer financial stability, companionship, and shared domestic responsibilities, decoupling marriage from romantic love. While some critics argue this new interpretation overlooks the historical oppression faced by the queer community, it highlights shifting societal views on relationships and commitment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to improve its price transparency for consumers. The inquiry was prompted by complaints over unclear pricing for Oasis's reunion tour, where some tickets were sold at significantly higher prices without additional benefits. The CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing" but mandated that Ticketmaster must now give 24-hour advance notice of tiered pricing systems and provide more accurate price information during online queues. The company will report to the CMA for the next two years to ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>Transportation experts are emphasizing the importance of "defensive walking and cycling" to reduce the thousands of preventable deaths that occur annually in the U.S. Key recommendations include being highly visible and predictable, using designated sidewalks and bike paths, and avoiding distractions like headphones or phones. Safety advocates stress that individuals should never assume a driver sees them and should actively make eye contact to confirm they have been noticed. Other critical tips include wearing a helmet correctly, using hand signals when biking, and prioritizing personal safety even when one has the right of way.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat in India has stated that the long-standing boundary dispute between the two nations should not define their overall relationship or obstruct cooperation. Speaking at an event, the envoy emphasized the need for a long-term strategic vision and peaceful coexistence, urging both sides to resolve differences through dialogue. The remarks come as both Beijing and New Delhi are navigating separate trade tensions and negotiations with the United States. The call for stable relations highlights the complex geopolitical landscape where both Asian powers are managing their strategic interests on multiple fronts.</p>

          <p>England's head coach has selected an unchanged starting team and replacements for the Women's Rugby World Cup final against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham stadium.

          <p>British boxer Chantelle Cameron has been promoted to the full WBC light-welterweight world champion after her rival, Katie Taylor, was named "champion in recess." Taylor informed the sanctioning body of her intention to take a break from boxing, leading to Cameron's elevation from interim status. Cameron famously handed Taylor her first professional defeat in 2023 before losing the rematch. The WBC has now ordered Cameron to make a mandatory title defense against fellow Briton Sandy Ryan, while Taylor is recognized as emeritus champion, granting her a direct title shot upon her return.</p>
