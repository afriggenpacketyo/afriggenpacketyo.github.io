          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom after failing to meet its delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class post arriving late. The company, already fined ¬£16m in previous years, cited ongoing modernization efforts and the need for universal service obligation reform, as first-class stamp prices continue to rise. Citizens Advice criticized Royal Mail for hiking stamp prices despite unreliable service, while shareholders approved the sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire.

          <p>The Chinese Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) has strongly criticized the Enhanced Games, set to debut in May 2026, which allows athletes to use banned substances. CHINADA views the event as a distortion of sportsmanship, turning competition into a drug contest that threatens athletes' health and contradicts the World Anti-Doping Code. They urge the global sports community to unite in opposing the Enhanced Games, which they say lures athletes with high prizes into risking their health for a "gladiator show."</p>

While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model of care, some experts express skepticism and call for robust testing and better funding for NHS mental health services.
