          <h2>NFL Analyst Suggests Shedeur Sanders' Draft Process Hindered His Draft Position</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 16:23:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN NFL Draft analyst Matt Miller believes Shedeur Sanders' handling of the draft process negatively impacted his draft position, as Sanders was eventually drafted in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns. Miller criticized Sanders for not participating in the NFL Scouting Combine or the East-West Shrine Game, suggesting Sanders and his camp overestimated his draft stock. Miller stated that Sanders' camp approached the draft process with the perception that Sanders was a lock for a top two or three draft pick, but that this was not guaranteed and that the NFL will humble anyone. Sanders will now compete for a starting job with the Browns, giving him the chance to prove his doubters wrong.</p>

          <p>Brazilian Civil Police arrested two suspects, reported to be fans of Lady Gaga, in connection with an alleged bomb attack plot targeting her free concert on Copacabana Beach. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives, including Molotov cocktails. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the concert, which drew over two million fans. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and that they had worked closely with law enforcement to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment guru, announced his plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he transformed from a failing textile manufacturer. Buffett's value investing approach, which involves buying wonderful businesses at fair prices, has influenced generations of financiers and made him a legendary figure in American capitalism. His company owns major stakes in businesses like BNSF railroad, American Express, and Coca-Cola, and his investment decisions are closely watched by millions. Gregory Abel is expected to succeed Buffett, though some worry Berkshire may lose its mythical status without its chief architect.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results.

The award recognizes Pence's commitment to democratic principles and his stand against efforts to subvert the electoral process, though Pence has largely been shunned by Trump and the Republican Party since leaving office.</p>
