          <p>Bed Bath & Beyond is relaunching over two years after its bankruptcy, with the first new 'Bed Bath & Beyond Home' store opening in Nashville. The revived brand, managed by The Brand House Collective, aims to attract former customers by promising to honor the company's iconic legacy coupons. While this marks a significant step in resurrecting the retailer, which previously closed all its brick-and-mortar locations, experts note the company's underlying financials remain troubled. The brand plans to open four more test stores in the Nashville area to refine its strategy for a broader 2026 rollout.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. He is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," where an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft, yet the crew returned safely to Earth. Lovell also flew on the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." His family and NASA remembered him as a hero whose character and courage were instrumental in space exploration.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their 17.5-hour journey back to Earth. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, carrying commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, and astronauts Takuya Onishi and Kirill Peskov, is scheduled for a Pacific Ocean splashdown off the California coast. This mission marks the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made to ensure debris from the capsule's trunk section falls harmlessly. The departure followed a six-day handover period with their replacements, the newly arrived Crew-11.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is spending part of his UK holiday with Foreign Secretary David Lammy, highlighting a surprising friendship between two politicians from different ends of the political spectrum. Despite past critical comments about each other's political allies, the two have bonded over shared experiences of dysfunctional childhoods, their Christian faith, and education at prestigious U.S. universities. This personal relationship is seen as politically significant, particularly as the UK's Labour government seeks to build bridges with potential Republican leaders in a personalized political landscape.</p>

          <p>Director Antonio Negret's new horror film, "Shaman," explores demonic possession through an Andean lens, telling the story of American missionaries in Ecuador whose son is afflicted. The film, a U.S.-Ecuador co-production, is deeply personal for the Colombian-born director, who drew on his multicultural upbringing and filmed in the remote Chimborazo region. To ensure authenticity, Negret collaborated closely with the local Indigenous community, who participated in the production and provided guidance on Kichwa language and traditional rituals. The movie utilizes the Andean demon "Supay" to offer a fresh perspective on the well-trodden exorcism genre.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Viral Claim of Trump's Plane Flying to Epstein's Island</h2>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to have no supporting evidence. The investigation notes that Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making landings by a large jet like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. Furthermore, the Facebook user who originated the claim was found to be wearing a pin from a pilot costume sold on Amazon. Trump has publicly denied ever visiting the island, and no credible evidence has emerged to contradict his statement.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul is combating a growing loneliness crisis by opening "warm-hearted convenience stores," safe spaces designed to help isolated individuals connect. These centers, which offer free ramen noodles and a welcoming cafe-like atmosphere, have seen far greater demand than expected, particularly from both young and old residents. The initiative is a response to a rise in "lonely deaths" and a study showing nearly 40% of Seoul households are single-person. The stores provide a low-stigma environment for people to find community, receive counseling, and escape the pressures of a hyper-competitive society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new documentary "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides a spirited and honest look at the late musician's life, avoiding a simple narrative of doom. The film focuses on Buckley's complex personality and creative journey through intimate interviews with his mother, former partners, and bandmates, as well as his own writings and recordings. It explores his turbulent upbringing, his artistic blossoming in New York, and his conflicted feelings about the fame that followed his sole album, "Grace." The documentary thoughtfully handles his 1997 death, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than a suicide.</p>

This dwindling number of pioneers highlights the passage of time as NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. The remaining Moon voyagers are Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott, all of whom walked on the Moon, and Fred Haise, who was part of the perilous Apollo 13 mission.

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. Lowe had urgently alerted authorities and called for mass deportations before the crew's identity was confirmed by the Coastguard. The rowers, who are attempting a journey from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research, said they found the incident "hilarious." In a subsequent post, Lowe explained it was a false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it is lowering the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move aligns Canada with the European Union and the United Kingdom, who recently made the same adjustment. The coordinated action is intended to further increase economic pressure on Moscow and limit a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. According to Canada's Finance Minister, the measure is part of a broader strategy by allied nations to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia for its illegal war. (not investment advice)</p>
