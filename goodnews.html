          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is set to return to UK high streets five years after closing its physical stores. It will be available in 32 John Lewis department stores starting February 2026, with its menswear line, Topman, in six locations. The brand, which was acquired by online retailer Asos after its parent company collapsed, is aiming for a major comeback under new ownership. This nationwide partnership is seen as a strategic move to attract new, multi-generational customers to John Lewis while reviving an iconic fashion name.</p>

          <p>During a recent trip to China, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has indicated support for President Xi Jinping's vision for a multipolar global order. Anwar's appearance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit highlighted Malaysia's alignment with China's Global Governance Initiative, which emphasizes sovereign equality and multilateralism. This move is seen as a demonstration of solidarity with the Global South, particularly as both nations face the threat of U.S. tariffs. The diplomatic gesture underscores a strengthening of ties between Malaysia and China in response to perceived unilateralism from Washington.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman Ronnie Stanley has highlighted the importance of the team's season-opening game against the Buffalo Bills. He described the matchup as more than a normal game, citing the Ravens' narrow 27-25 divisional round playoff loss to the Bills last season as a key motivator. Stanley expressed the team's determination to secure a victory and reverse the previous outcome. He also defended teammate Mark Andrews, who faced criticism for mistakes in the playoff game, stating that Andrews is a "true warrior" ready to prove himself again.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have withdrawn a theft charge against a man who was accused of stealing flowers from the public tributes for the late musician Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham. The court was informed that a security guard had given the 45-year-old man, Parviz Jafari, permission to take the flowers. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction because it could not be proven that his actions were dishonest. Osbourne, the iconic heavy metal star, passed away in July at the age of 76.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old Northwestern University professor, Nina Kraus, has been found after being reported missing on Labor Day. Kraus, a distinguished professor of neurobiology, disappeared after leaving her home for a walk without her phone, prompting an urgent search by Evanston and university police, which included the use of drones. She was located in Evanston on Tuesday evening and transported to a local hospital for treatment. Her current condition has not been disclosed by the authorities, but her discovery has brought relief after a day of community concern.</p>

          <p>Midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has revealed that during his nearly seven-year absence from the England national team, he had "completely forgot" about international football and was "just a fan." The 29-year-old, who last played for England in 2018, suffered a severe Achilles rupture in 2019 which derailed his career momentum. After a successful move to AC Milan in 2023, his strong performances have earned him a recall to the squad under manager Thomas Tuchel. Loftus-Cheek credits his self-belief and drive for overcoming the mental and physical challenges of his recovery.</p>

          <p>An analysis by Morgan Stanley suggests that China's major property developers are poised for a business recovery in the second half of the year. The report predicts that the recent slump will recede, with sales declines slowing significantly and potentially picking up by the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on developers' positive guidance regarding margin recovery and rental income growth, as well as a large stock of completed homes in higher-tier cities. The forecast contrasts with the weak first-half results reported by many developers struggling in a multi-year downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new record high, hitting $3,546.99 per ounce, as the World Gold Council announced plans to launch a digital form of the precious metal.

The price rally is also fueled by investors seeking a safe haven asset due to global economic uncertainty and the prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts.

          <p>For the first time, minimum salaries are being introduced for players in the top two tiers of professional women's football in England, the WSL and WSL 2. The new requirement, described as a "full-time wage," is part of a broader effort by the league's new governing body, WSL Football, to professionalize the game. The salary thresholds will vary based on factors like age, league, and experience. In addition to salaries, clubs must now meet stricter criteria for high-performance environments, including mandatory "performance wellbeing" staff and improved safeguarding protocols.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist is making a bold prediction that the Rams will make it to the Super Bowl this season, forecasting at least 11 wins. The optimism is based on several factors, including a talented roster, an ascending young defense, and the leadership of coach Sean McVay and quarterback Matthew Stafford. Key offseason moves, such as acquiring receiver Davante Adams and strengthening the offensive line, are seen as addressing the weaknesses that led to last season's narrow playoff exit. The author argues that with a favorable schedule, the team has all the necessary components for a deep postseason run.</p>

          <p>Contrary to a common narrative that marriage and motherhood lead to female unhappiness, a new national survey of American women finds that married mothers are the most likely group to report being "very happy." The study, which controlled for age, income, and education, found 19% of married mothers described themselves as very happy, compared to 10-13% of other groups, including unmarried women without children. Married mothers were also most likely to feel their life has a clear sense of purpose and meaning. The author suggests these roles provide unique benefits often overlooked in public discourse.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Fees on Plastic Bags May Be More Effective at Reducing Litter Than Bans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing plastic bag policies across the U.S. has found that imposing a tax or fee on plastic bags may be more effective at reducing pollution than outright bans. Researchers cross-referenced local policies with data from over 45,000 shoreline cleanups. They found that while partial bans had minimal effect, policies combining a full ban with a fee on alternative bags led to a 25-47% decrease in plastic bag litter. The study also noted a potential 37% reduction in animal entanglement in areas with such policies, highlighting the direct environmental benefits of well-designed legislation.</p>

          <p>In an unusual series of events, federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., have recently rejected at least four separate indictment requests from the Department of Justice. The cases involved charges ranging from threatening the president to assaulting a federal agent. Legal experts describe the rejections as "exceptionally rare," suggesting that jurors may be disagreeing with the DOJ's theory of prosecution or that the administration has lost credibility with local jurors. The trend raises questions about prosecutorial discretion and the relationship between the Justice Department and the D.C. community.</p>
