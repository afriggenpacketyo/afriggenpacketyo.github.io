          <p>Bill Gates has announced that he will donate 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned, with the goal of distributing $200 billion over the next 20 years to causes such as global health and education. Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's essay "The Gospel of Wealth," Gates aims to address urgent global problems and reduce childhood deaths. He expressed concern that progress could be stalled by cuts to foreign aid from the U.S. and European countries and praised global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush, emphasizing the need to maintain such programs.</p>

          <p>The British government has reached a trade deal with the United States, which will ease the impact of recent increases in U.S. tariffs. President Trump announced the agreement, describing it as "full and comprehensive" and cementing the relationship between the two countries. The deal is expected to support certain sectors, including Britain's auto industry, and boost consumer and business sentiment, however, economists caution that the greater threat to Britain is the uncertainty that Trump's trade policy has created globally, rather than tariffs on Britain.</p>
