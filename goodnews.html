          <p>The Federal Reserve is considering relaxing a key capital rule for large Wall Street banks, a move intended to boost their operational capacity. The proposed change to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) aims to free up capital currently tied to safe assets like Treasurys. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell supports the revision as a prudent adjustment to address the binding nature of the eSLR, some officials, like Governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr, express concerns that banks may use the freed-up capital for shareholder distributions rather than increasing Treasury market intermediation. The proposed rule changes are open for public comment for 60 days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan indicated the company is exploring options such as airport lounges, premium seating, and even long-haul international flights to attract high-spending customers. This represents a shift for Southwest, which has traditionally differentiated itself with policies like open seating and a uniform cabin. Jordan emphasized that Southwest is willing to adapt to customer needs in 2025 and beyond, while still maintaining its unique approach. The airline is facing increased competition and pressure from investors to boost revenue, particularly as airfares in the U.S. have been dropping, and they have already seen customers defect to other airlines since it introduced no-frills basic economy tickets and bag fees late last month.</p>

The new panel will assess the cumulative effects of the recommended vaccine schedule, including interactions between different vaccines and the timing of vaccine administration.

          <p>The article examines the potential consequences of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil exports. While such a move could inflict significant damage on the global economy, it would also harm Iran's own interests by disrupting its oil revenue and upsetting its trading partner, China. Neighboring countries like Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates, which also rely on the strait for oil transport, would also be negatively impacted. Experts suggest that any blockade would likely face a swift military response from the US and European countries, limiting its duration to a day or two.</p>

His campaign focused on issues such as rent freezes, free bus service, and universal childcare, resonating with voters concerned about affordability.

          <p>A member of Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s newly appointed vaccine advisory panel withdrew after a conflict of interest review. Dr. Michael Ross, who was involved in multiple private healthcare companies, stepped down after a review of his financial holdings.

          <h2>Pasadena Mayor's Coffee Can Serves as Reminder of Undocumented Past</h2>

          <p>Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo keeps a Folgers coffee can in his office as a reminder of his family's experience as undocumented immigrants. His parents, who crossed the border from Mexico, kept cash, important documents, and phone numbers in a similar can under their bed. Gordo says the raids and fear created by current immigration policies are offensive and painful, given his family's history. He advocates for immigration reform that would serve the needs of employers and provide immigrants with a pathway to legal status.</p>
