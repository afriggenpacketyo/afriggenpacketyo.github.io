          <p>Two asylum hotel companies, Clearsprings and Mears, have committed to returning profits exceeding 5% to the Home Office, following scrutiny over contracts signed by the previous Conservative government. These contracts stipulated that Clearsprings, Mears, and Serco would reimburse profits above the 5% threshold, with a recent report indicating the firms collectively earned ¬£383m since 2019 due to tripled housing costs for asylum seekers. Clearsprings indicated readiness to transfer ¬£32m, while Mears expects to pay back ¬£13.8m, pending Home Office audit. The Home Office aims to reduce hotel usage and save ¬£4bn by the end of 2026 through increased asylum decision-making and removals.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market's recovery to pre-tariff levels, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding the final level of tariffs. The S&P 500 has rebounded since the start of the year, but investors are hesitant to fully commit, awaiting clearer signs of the economic impact of tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, holding off on further interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are known. This prolonged uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investments and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has lifted the lifetime bans on Pete Rose and 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, along with 15 other deceased players, making them eligible for potential Hall of Fame induction. The decision, prompted by an application from the Rose family following Pete Rose's death, alters MLB's policy that permanent ineligibility ends upon the death of the disciplined individual. Rose, known as Charlie Hustle, was banned for life for betting on baseball, while Jackson was banned for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. Despite their reinstatement, it remains to be seen whether they will be elected to the Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>A small nodule was discovered in former President Joe Biden's prostate during a routine physical exam, prompting further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The finding comes amid the release of excerpts from a new book claiming Biden's health was declining during his presidency, with aides considering the possibility of him needing a wheelchair if reelected. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, have pushed back against such claims, asserting that they are inaccurate and lack factual basis. This news follows Biden's previous removal of a cancerous lesion from his chest in 2023 and past non-melanoma skin cancer removals.</p>

          <p>Following the discovery of a small nodule in former President Joseph Biden's prostate, urologists discuss the range of possible causes, from benign inflammation to cancer. Experts question the necessity of a manual prostate exam at his age, given the slow-growing nature of prostate cancers and the potential risks of unnecessary treatment. The next steps in evaluating the nodule could include a PSA test, urine test, MRI, or biopsy, with the decision to treat any cancer requiring careful consideration of the patient's overall health. Doctors emphasize the importance of shared decision-making with the patient before pursuing further testing.</p>

          <p>The latest inflation report shows a cooling trend, which could impact the price of gold, traditionally seen as an inflation hedge. However, geopolitical tensions, central bank demand, interest rates, recession fears, and currency volatility also play significant roles in shaping the gold market. Despite easing inflation, gold prices have remained strong due to these factors, with analysts predicting continued growth this year. Investors should consider the broader economic landscape beyond inflation figures when making decisions about gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, a decision made after speaking with the Saudi crown prince.
