Cole Prosek, an Ole Miss commit, earned the MVP award for his crucial contributions, including two RBI singles that fueled his team's comeback from a 4-0 deficit. The annual event, held at Petco Park, provides a national stage for elite prospects in front of MLB scouts and executives.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's club captain, Cristian Romero, has signed a new four-year contract, securing his position with the North London team until 2029. The 27-year-old Argentina centre-back has been a key player since joining from Atalanta in 2021, making 126 appearances and recently captaining the side to a Europa League victory. This deal ends summer speculation linking him to a move to Atletico Madrid and follows right-back Djed Spence in committing to a new long-term contract. Romero's extension solidifies his leadership role under new head coach Thomas Frank.</p>

          <p>In the California Area School District in Pennsylvania, Superintendent Dr. Laura Jacob is using 3D printing technology to create violins for students, overcoming the financial barrier of expensive instrument rentals. Inspired by the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, she produces the instruments for about $50 each and offers them for free to any student in the district, where over 70% are from low-income families. The program has produced over 200 violins in five years and now includes a weekly 3D violin club, aiming to foster a lifelong love for music and build student confidence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remain attractive, financial experts advise savers to carefully consider their personal financial situation before investing. Key factors include ensuring a sufficient emergency fund is maintained and assessing liquidity needs to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Experts also suggest comparing CD rates with other low-risk options and considering the potential for future Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could make locking in current rates advantageous. A CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, is recommended to maintain flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of its earnings report, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike received a short-term negative call from Evercore ISI, citing subdued channel checks and a premium valuation. The CNBC Investing Club views this caution as a potential buying opportunity, noting the stock's history of post-earnings pullbacks. The article also looks ahead to competitor Palo Alto Networks' earnings as a bellwether for the sector, where investors are watching to see if the company can buck a recent trend of weaker results among some cybersecurity names.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to a new ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt and Qatar. The comprehensive two-stage plan would involve Hamas releasing approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages during a 60-day temporary truce. During this period, negotiations would continue toward a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. This development follows a breakdown in previous talks and comes as Israel's cabinet is expected to approve plans for an expanded military offensive in the region.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meets with U.S. leaders, an analysis from the Kiel Institute reveals that European nations combined have committed more financial aid to Ukraine than the United States since Russia's 2022 invasion. While the U.S. is the largest single donor, with $130.6 billion in aid, Europe as a whole has provided $165.7 billion. This data counters past claims by President Trump suggesting Europe was not contributing its fair share. The report also clarifies that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mixture of grants and loans to support Ukraine's defense and economy.</p>

          <p>In response to political pressure to lower drug costs, Novo Nordisk will now offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash. This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350 and will be available through various platforms, including GoodRx and the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy. The move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured patients and to compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions of the drug. Eli Lilly has made similar price cuts for its competing medications.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power have announced a plan to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor, a 50-megawatt facility, will provide carbon-free electricity to power Google's regional data centers. In a first for the U.S. utility industry, Kairos and Google will assume the financial risk of building the plant, while TVA will purchase the power, a model designed to avoid passing construction costs to consumers. The project aims to commercialize smaller, more affordable nuclear technology to meet growing energy demands.</p>

Other new entries include "broligarchy," referring to powerful tech industry men, and "mouse jiggler," a device for feigning work activity in a remote setting.

The change is intended to create a distinct identity for the news organization as it establishes its own independent newsroom, which has already involved hiring dozens of journalists to build out its own bureaus.</p>
