          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued a baby who had been left alone in an apartment for several days following the death of the infant's mother. Officers responded to a welfare check called in by a neighbor and found the baby visibly emaciated but alive. The infant was immediately transported to a hospital for lifesaving medical care and is now expected to make a full recovery.

          <p>Researchers analyzing DNA from skeletons at √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, have found evidence suggesting it may have been a matrilineal society. The study of over 130 skeletons revealed that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line, indicating that men likely moved into their wives' homes after marriage. Further evidence, such as a higher quantity of grave goods buried with females, supports the theory that women held a prominent social status. This finding challenges traditional assumptions about ancient social structures being universally patrilineal.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations to her leg and foot after being bitten in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island. While the woman did not see what bit her, experts believe the injuries were most likely caused by a juvenile sand tiger shark. Her injuries were not life-threatening, and she was treated at the scene. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols using drones and lifeguards will continue to monitor the waters to ensure swimmer safety.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's administration. The event, which organizers estimate drew a record crowd, proceeded despite a new "child protection" law used to prohibit gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. The march was attended by Hungarian citizens, activists, and numerous European Union officials showing solidarity. The large turnout is seen as a powerful rebuke of the government's restrictive policies against the LGBTQ+ community and a broader defense of civil liberties.</p>

A key focus of the inquiry will be the controversial procurement of face masks under former Health Minister Jens Spahn, which involved ordering masks at high prices that were never paid for, potentially costing taxpayers billions. The commission aims to learn lessons for future crises, regain public trust, and examine the role of scientific advice in political decision-making.
