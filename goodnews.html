          <p>Archaeologists have announced the discovery of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857, resulting in the death of 16 crew members. The find, a collaboration between the Australian National Maritime Museum and the SilentWorld Foundation, was made after a four-year search. Components of the ship, including its windlass, were found, confirming the ship's identity based on its dimensions and the water depth. Future monitoring visits are planned to further assess the site and uncover more of this important piece of maritime history.</p>

          <p>In San Jose, California, a cold case from 1977 has been solved with the arrest of Willie Eugene Sims for the murder of Jeannette Ralston, who was found strangled in her car. The case went cold due to a lack of leads, but investigators never gave up. A thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene matched Sims after the F.B.I. upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm. Sims, who was stationed at Fort Ord at the time of the murder, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery, and DNA evidence further linked him to the crime.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club is aiming to create the "best stand in the world" with its new Riverside Stand, which includes a rooftop swimming pool and Michelin-star dining. The stand, part of an American sport-inspired hospitality experience, is designed to resemble a five-star hotel or cruise ship, offering views of the River Thames. Architect Phillip Johnson emphasized the focus on the river view rather than the pitch, creating a unique design reminiscent of rowing and boat houses. The stand will also operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays.</p>

The fine was doubled due to a prior violation within 180 days, and the money will go to a jockey mental health program.

US President Donald Trump reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire after a conversation with Prime Minister Starmer.
