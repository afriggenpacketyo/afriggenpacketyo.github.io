          <p>Salesforce reported strong first-quarter results, surpassing expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The company's revenue grew by 7.6% year-over-year, and net income remained relatively stable. CEO Marc Benioff expressed optimism, highlighting the planned acquisition of Informatica, a data management company, for $8 billion, which would be Salesforce's largest acquisition since the Slack deal. Salesforce also introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents, resulting in significant cost savings through the reassignment of customer support workers. The company raised its full-year forecast, projecting adjusted earnings per share and revenue above consensus estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% increase in revenue, reaching $44.1 billion, despite U.S. government restrictions on AI chip sales to China. The company's net income rose by 26% to $18.78 billion, although it fell short of Wall Street's profit predictions. Nvidia projects a 50% revenue increase in the current quarter, driven by sales of its new Blackwell AI chip, however the company anticipates losing $8 billion due to the Trump administration's restrictions. CEO Jensen Huang criticized the U.S. restrictions, arguing that they strengthen Chinese chipmakers and weaken America's position, while the company is finding new markets for its chips in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to the emergence of the "TACO" acronym, which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out," used by Wall Street to describe his trade negotiation style. The acronym refers to the pattern of Trump announcing tariffs, markets declining, and then Trump easing the tariffs, causing markets to rebound. Trump defended his approach, stating that it is a form of negotiation and that his tariff threats have brought other countries to the negotiating table. He questioned whether it would be better to maintain tariffs at a high level, such as the 145% tariff imposed on China.</p>
