          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng addressed the US-China Business Council, calling the trade relationship "generally balanced" but criticizing US tariffs on Chinese imports as "unreasonably high." He argued that US export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms hinder deficit reduction. Xie stated China is willing to buy more from America, but the US restricts exports of competitive products like semiconductors. Earlier in June, the US agreed to ease some restrictions in exchange for increased exports of critical minerals from China, with talks ongoing to implement a trade consensus reached in May.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers announced plans to assist immigrant communities recently impacted in Los Angeles, marking their first public comment since federal immigration agents began raids in the Southland. The Dodgers' silence had drawn criticism from fans, prompting calls for the team to address the situation. Manager Dave Roberts hoped the team could be a positive distraction, while utilityman Kik√© Hern√°ndez expressed solidarity with the affected communities. The announcement follows controversy over a Spanish version of the national anthem sung at a game as a protest against the raids, and the silence on the situation will soon be broken.</p>

          <p>According to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report, the trust fund Social Security relies on to pay retirement benefits may be depleted in 2033, at which point 77% of those benefits will be payable. The combined trust funds will have enough revenue to pay scheduled benefits and administrative costs until 2034, when 81% of the combined benefits will be payable. The Disability Insurance fund will be able to pay full benefits through at least 2099. The new Social Security trustees report takes into account the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act.</p>
