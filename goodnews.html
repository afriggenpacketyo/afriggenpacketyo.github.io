          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a "wet reckless" charge, a lesser offense, stemming from a 2024 DUI incident in California. The 23-year-old was arrested after being found asleep behind the wheel of his car. As part of the plea deal, Addison will complete online courses and pay a fine, with his probation potentially being reduced. While this resolves the state-level legal matter, the third-year player could still face disciplinary action from the NFL, which has stated the incident remains under review.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim that it had a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the region. Exxon, a partner in the Guyana project, stated it disagrees with but respects the ruling. The acquisition's completion removes major uncertainty for Chevron, though its CEO indicated some job reductions are expected as the two companies integrate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a way for savers to protect their money from inflation, with top accounts offering rates higher than the current inflation rate. The article notes a significant disparity between national average CD yields and the higher rates available, particularly from online banks which have lower overhead costs. It also explains the "inverted yield curve" phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones. To maximize returns, savers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider a CD laddering strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to the White House's pointed questions regarding cost overruns in the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In a letter to the Office of Management and Budget Director, Powell directed critics to a new public webpage with project details and refuted claims of luxurious amenities. The inquiry is seen as part of a broader White House pressure campaign against Powell amid President Trump's frustration over interest rate policies. Powell's reply maintained a professional tone, explaining the reasons for the budget issues without addressing the political accusations directly. (not investment advice)</p>

The group had previously condemned the investigation as an act of "political policing intimidation," while celebrating their performance as one of love and solidarity.</p>

          <p>With the price of silver surging to its highest point in over a decade, the article explores whether gold investors should shift their focus. Silver offers many of the same benefits as gold, such as being a hedge against inflation, but at a much lower entry price. However, the article cautions against a complete switch, noting gold's historical stability and significantly higher value. It suggests that the current market provides a timely opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their precious metal allocations within a diversified portfolio, rather than abandoning one metal for the other.

Speaking at a trade expo, the envoy stated there is no sign of restrictions targeting Chinese companies ahead of the trade deal's review next year. Instead, any revisions to the USMCA are expected to focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements, which would necessitate a higher percentage of a product's components to be sourced locally to qualify for preferential treatment, rather than targeting specific countries of origin for investment.

She argues that the expectation of constant work and weekend availability is unrealistic and particularly burdensome for female entrepreneurs, who often manage a disproportionate share of family duties. Egan has had to adjust her business timeline to accommodate her pregnancy, pushing back a fundraising round. She advocates for a more balanced approach, asserting that having a life outside of work is essential for mental health and ultimately contributes to her success.</p>

          <p>The article provides the current price of gold and explains the various factors that influence its market value. As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold's price is affected by supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and central bank policies also play a significant role, as investors often turn to gold during times of instability. Furthermore, since gold is priced in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency strength can impact its cost for foreign investors, thereby influencing overall demand and price levels.

          <p>The 1998 conviction of postmistress Patricia Owen for theft has been referred to the UK's Court of Appeal, marking the first case linked to the Post Office's Capture IT system to be re-examined. Capture was a precursor to the notorious Horizon software, which led to nearly 1,000 wrongful convictions in a major national scandal. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred Owen's case on the grounds that her prosecution was an abuse of process. This development is seen as a landmark moment for those affected by the earlier Capture system, who suffered similar issues to the Horizon victims.</p>

          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's content like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" is proving crucial for customer retention and profitability. Because kids tend to re-watch shows repeatedly, this content drives high engagement and reduces subscriber churn, a major economic challenge for services like Netflix and Disney+. Children's programming is also less expensive to produce and has a longer shelf life than other content. As a result, media companies are increasingly investing in deep libraries of kids' shows and leveraging platforms like YouTube to build franchises and keep families subscribed long-term.</p>

The doctor's statement assured that tests showed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure, and that the president "remains in excellent health."</p>
