          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, placing the company's valuation at $8.6 billion. The pricing falls at the midpoint of the previously expected range and marks the culmination of a multi-year effort to go public, which had been delayed twice. Co-founder Eric Baker, who reacquired the company in 2020, is bringing it to the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." The IPO comes amid a recent resurgence in the market for public offerings, following a period of high inflation and rising interest rates.</p>

          <p>Following his death, this appreciation reflects on Robert Redford's career, emphasizing his deliberate choice to pursue complex, often flawed characters instead of relying on his conventional good looks for simple heroic roles. The article highlights how Redford rejected lucrative but shallow parts to explore morally ambiguous figures in films like "The Candidate" and "Three Days of the Condor." It argues that he used his all-American image as a "Trojan horse" to critique American ideals and challenge audiences, leaving a legacy defined by both the celebrated films he made and the easy, feel-good roles he refused to play.</p>

          <p>Five partially built, 5,000-square-foot homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon will finally be torn down after a two-decade-long legal fight. The city first ordered the structures demolished in 2003 after the original developers failed to complete a required environmental impact assessment. Over the years, a series of new owners attempted to restart the project without complying with the demolition order. The current developers, who faced 35 criminal charges for illegal construction, reached a plea agreement with the city attorney's office and must demolish the dilapidated homes by August 2026.</p>

Cramer cited the bank's strong performance in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as its unmatched global reach, as key factors driving its growth. The bank's stock has risen nearly 29% year-to-date, currently valued around $850 billion. Cramer believes the "real rocket fuel" for JPMorgan is the expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple, as Wall Street shows increased willingness to pay a premium for bank stocks.

          <h2>One in Four UK Driving Tests Now Taken in Automatic Cars, Driven by Rise of Electric Vehicles</h2>

          <p>New data from the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals a significant shift in driving habits, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a more than fourfold increase since 2012. The trend is largely attributed to the growing popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics can be easier for learners, allowing them to concentrate more on the road, which may also improve overall road safety.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported in parts of Washington state after strong winds kicked up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs during dry and windy conditions, lifting the loose, decades-old ash back into the atmosphere. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have both confirmed that this is not the result of any new volcanic activity. However, officials have warned that the resuspended ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is demonstrating a significant shift in strategy under new manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the attack-focused style of the previous season. The team's recent 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal marked their fourth clean sheet in five games, a stark contrast to last year. Players have highlighted the new "clean sheet mentality," focusing on a strong defensive structure that makes the team difficult to play against. While effective, this pragmatism has resulted in fewer shots on goal, trading offensive excitement for defensive resilience and consistent results.</p>

Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that despite the challenges of pausing the season, the decision was made because of the Olympics' high visibility and the strong desire of the players to represent their countries. A new agreement with the IOC provides the league with better promotional rights and improved conditions for players. The return is seen as a significant moment for international hockey, allowing for a true "best-on-best" competition.</p>

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that more major sports conglomerates will go public. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly in private markets, and publicly traded teams often trade below their intrinsic value. He argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which can involve significant spending that public markets might not embrace. Instead, leagues like the NFL are turning to approved private equity firms for minority investments, which provide capital while allowing owners to maintain long-term control.</p>
