          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to lower U.S. drug prices by tying them to lower prices abroad, a move praised by some as beneficial for patients struggling with high medication costs. The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to address "unreasonable and discriminatory policies" in foreign countries that suppress drug prices. It also aims to allow U.S. patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the "most favored nation" prices, cutting out middlemen.  Pharmaceutical companies are expected to resist this policy, arguing it could hurt profits and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A power failure caused significant disruption across the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to line suspensions and severe delays. Transport for London (TfL) attributed the issue to a power outage in south-west London, which has since been restored, but delays persist. Waterloo station was among the worst affected, with Jubilee, Northern, and Bakerloo line trains impacted.  TfL is working to restore normal service, but passengers are experiencing significant travel difficulties.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. will launch its direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, before the National Football League season, offering access to cable TV subscribers at no additional cost. The pricing will be in line with wholesale pricing, similar to the cost of the channels for pay tv distributors.  Fox plans to offer the app as part of bundles with other distributors and services.  This move comes after Fox abandoned efforts to launch Venu, a joint venture sports streaming app, and aims to compete with other streaming services.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, though it will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. The plane needs to be checked for security before being accepted. Trump defended the gift, noting the current Air Force One is nearly 40 years old.  Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the ethics of accepting the gift.</p>

          <p>Apple is paying $95 million to settle allegations that Siri-enabled devices eavesdropped on consumers. Consumers who owned Siri-enabled iPhones, MacBooks, and AppleTVs between Sept. 17, 2014, and Dec. 31, 2024, and experienced unintended Siri activation during private communications are eligible to file a claim. The settlement stems from a lawsuit claiming Siri listened to private conversations and shared them with third-party businesses for targeted advertising. Consumers can file claims for up to five devices, with a maximum payout of $100.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, could lead to more significant weight loss compared to semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. The study, funded by Lilly, found that tirzepatide users lost about 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost about 14% over 72 weeks. Beyond weight loss, the drugs also offer health benefits like reduced blood pressure and improved blood sugar levels. The high cost and limited insurance coverage of these medications remain significant challenges.</p>
