          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased, reaching its highest point in two weeks, even after the Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut this week. This counterintuitive market reaction suggests investors are weighing broader economic factors beyond the Fed's immediate monetary policy, including rising GDP estimates and slight inflation upticks. While the Fed's move was intended to manage economic risks, the bond market's behavior indicates that concerns about long-term growth, inflation, and government debt are influencing investor sentiment.

French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the restored towers, allowing visitors to once again climb the stairs for panoramic views of the city. The successful and timely reconstruction, which has drawn nearly 30,000 daily visitors since the cathedral's main reopening, is seen as a significant achievement for Macron, who had pledged to complete the work within five years.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations providing key details on President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which creates a new tax deduction for tipped workers. The provision allows for a deduction of up to $25,000 in qualified tips annually from 2025 to 2028. The guidance clarifies that certain professions, such as those in healthcare and legal services, do not qualify, and mandatory or automatic gratuities are also excluded because they are not considered voluntary payments from customers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several more affordable options for borrowing money compared to recent years. Among the cheapest methods are home equity-based products, with a home equity line of credit (HELOC) currently offering the lowest average rates due to its variable nature. Home equity loans provide the stability of a fixed rate, while unsecured personal loans remain a viable option that does not require putting up one's home as collateral, though rates are slightly higher.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the cinematic legacy of Robert Redford, arguing that a central theme throughout his work was the hollowness of easy victory and the corrupting nature of being seen as a "winner." From "Downhill Racer" to "The Candidate," Redford consistently portrayed characters whose athletic or political triumphs revealed a deeper moral ambiguity or personal cost. This recurring motif, rooted in his own experiences with sports and stardom, offered a nuanced critique of America's obsession with winning, establishing him as an artist of great substance beyond his iconic good looks.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker traffic that was lost during recent years of drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers next year and are developing a new pipeline project to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus, freeing up canal capacity. These initiatives aim to provide more flexibility and reliability for energy shippers, who had increasingly opted for longer routes like the Cape of Good Hope due to transit restrictions.</p>

          <p>According to sources, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is in the process of raising $10 billion in a funding round that would value the company at $200 billion. This massive valuation reflects the intense investor interest in foundational AI models, following similar large-scale fundraising by competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied the report on his social media platform X, the potential funding would likely be used to build out the extensive computing infrastructure required for developing next-generation AI.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint violated court rules by not being a "short and plain statement." The judge characterized the filing as a "protected platform to rage against an adversary" rather than a proper legal document. Trump has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint, while the newspaper welcomed the swift ruling, calling the original lawsuit a political document with no legal merit.</p>

The visit is being planned as a separate event from the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the U.S., reflecting the president's stated fondness for the British monarchy and the "special relationship" between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A review of Nine Inch Nails' recent concert at the Forum in Los Angeles highlights the band's potent relevance in the current political and social climate. The performance, part of the "Peel It Back" tour, channeled feelings of rage, disgust, and desolation, with songs like their cover of David Bowie's "I'm Afraid of Americans" taking on new resonance. The show demonstrated the duo's dual strengths: their acclaimed work as film composers and their ability to deliver a viscerally nasty and violent rock performance that captures the unsettling mood of the nation.</p>
