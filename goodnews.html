          <p>Liverpool has reportedly reached an agreement to sign German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for ¬£116 million, including ¬£100 million guaranteed plus ¬£16 million in add-ons based on sustained success. Wirtz, who debuted for Leverkusen at 17, has scored 57 goals in 197 games and helped them win the Bundesliga in 2024; he has also scored seven goals in 31 appearances for Germany since his international debut in 2021. This move follows Liverpool's acquisition of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen and their pursuit of Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth as they bolster their squad after winning the Premier League title in Arne Slot's first season.</p>

Wang's remarks underscore the importance of bilateral cooperation projects like the Agadem oilfield and pipeline, developed and built by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing a comprehensive plan to adapt to increased rainfall due to climate change, including projects like the Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel and "sponge parks." The tunnel stores excess rainwater, while parks like Enghaveparken are designed to transform into reservoirs during heavy rain. The city is also constructing a human-made island, Lynetteholm, to protect against storm surges, with completion expected by 2070. Copenhagen's climate adaptation planning has garnered international attention, with the city consulting with others on implementing similar infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement in the construction industry promotes deconstruction, the practice of disassembling buildings for reusable materials, to limit the climate impact of the built environment. This approach creates a circular economy for building materials, keeping waste out of landfills and shrinking the carbon footprint of construction. Deconstruction and reuse industries have gained traction in cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., where old housing stock is being replaced. While deconstruction presents challenges like infrastructure needs and increased costs, it offers significant potential for reducing embodied carbon emissions and promoting sustainable building practices.</p>

          <p>During protests against immigration detentions in Los Angeles, demonstrators wave various national flags, including those of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, as symbols of their heritage and community. Critics have condemned the display of foreign flags, while protesters explain that the flags represent their roots, immigrant parents, and a diverse community united against injustice. The flags are seen as markers of the community's makeup and a way to express pride and resistance against erasure. The flags underscore the message that you can't erase me, and I matter.</p>

          <p>A new student loan program is emerging that features no interest, no fees, and a "pay-it-forward" model, aimed at helping students like Joshua Alferos, who almost had to drop out of college due to financial constraints. The program loans students money to finish college, with repayments starting once they earn a minimum salary, and some employers help pay off the loans. California is joining this effort with a San Diego county-run program and a bill in the Assembly, targeting majors in behavioral health. These programs aim to multiply the number of students who can benefit from financial aid and fill shortages in critical industries. (not investment advice)</p>
