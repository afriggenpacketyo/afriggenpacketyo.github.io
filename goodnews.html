          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's actions to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling came after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, took over USIP's headquarters, terminated staff, and replaced board members following an executive order deeming the group "unnecessary." Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president and stated that the administration's actions violated Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members. The USIP hailed the ruling, stating it would allow them to continue their work promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations, covering areas such as fishing, trade, defense, and energy. A key part of the deal involves granting European fishing boats continued access to British waters until 2038 in exchange for easing trade frictions. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a move forward from Brexit disputes, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a historic moment. However, the agreement has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who view it as a "surrender" to the EU.</p>

          <p>President Trump said that his two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine was "excellent" and that negotiations toward a ceasefire would begin immediately. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and indicated that Pope Leo XIV expressed interest in hosting negotiations. Despite Trump's optimism, Putin has given little public indication of eagerness for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy urged the U.S. not to walk away from Ukraine and the talks, emphasizing that Ukraine has always been ready for peace.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump joined President Trump in signing into law the Take It Down Act, which criminalizes posting "intimate images" online without consent and requires tech companies to remove the content within 48 hours. The First Lady has championed the bill since her husband began his second term, arguing that children need to be protected from hurtful online behavior. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship. The law makes posting "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content illegal, with violators facing up to three years in prison.</p>
