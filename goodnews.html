Analysts suggest the market views this development as a net positive, as securing 85% of potential revenue from the vast Chinese market is preferable to being completely shut out. This arrangement allows the American tech giants to compete against local Chinese players like Huawei, a priority that currently outweighs the cost of the fee. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision provides temporary stability in the fragile trade relationship between the two economic powers.
