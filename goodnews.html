          <p>Wynn Resorts has withdrawn its application for a casino license in New York City, citing that there are better uses for its capital due to persistent opposition during the rezoning process. Wynn had partnered with Related Companies to develop an integrated casino resort in Manhattan's Hudson Yards. This follows Las Vegas Sands' decision to withdraw its bid for a Long Island site due to potential competition from online gaming. Wynn Resorts says it will instead focus on stock buybacks and existing developments, including the first casino resort in the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tax relief can help with past-due IRS debt by reducing the amount owed, pausing collection efforts, or making payments more manageable. The IRS offers programs like Offers in Compromise, installment agreements, and penalty abatement. Taxpayers should consider that relief doesn't mean forgiveness, and consequences like liens or wage garnishments may still occur. Staying compliant with future tax obligations is crucial for maintaining relief arrangements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an advanced stage of prostate cancer has raised questions about screening practices. Biden, 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024, as screenings are not routinely recommended for men over 70. The diagnosis came after he saw a doctor for urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule in the prostate. Treatment goals would focus on controlling the cancer and preserving quality of life.</p>
