        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge found the policy arbitrary and lacking specificity, noting Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal transportation funds. The decision prevents the government from enforcing the new immigration rules while the lawsuit proceeds through court.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge in rice prices coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023. The Bank of Japan held rates steady at 0.5% after its recent monetary policy meeting but indicated future rate increases are possible if underlying inflation approaches 2%. Rising geopolitical tensions and their impact on energy prices could further influence inflation trends in Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hawaii is one of the few states in the U.S. without billboards, a result of over a century of work by The Outdoor Circle. Since 1912, the organization has advocated for laws, planted trees, and led efforts to preserve the islands' natural beauty. The Outdoor Circle is currently fighting a bill that would allow corporate naming rights for public buildings, which they view as a threat to Hawaii's unique visual character and cultural identity. The organization also works on community gardens, educational programs, and political advocacy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from forcing states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation funding. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by Democratic state attorneys general who argued the administration was unlawfully coercing them into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda. The judge sided with the states, preventing the administration from imposing immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress for transportation projects. The ruling underscores ongoing legal battles over immigration policy and federal funding.</p>
