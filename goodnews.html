        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The once-dominant fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone physical stores to the UK's High Street. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, closing all locations, the brand was acquired by online retailer Asos. Now, leveraging a wave of social media nostalgia, Topshop aims to recapture its "cool" factor and appeal to both its original millennial followers and a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers, despite facing a competitive market and higher price points than fast-fashion rivals.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. The purpose of the upcoming discussion is to pursue a comprehensive peace agreement to end the war, rather than what Trump described as a less reliable ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and European leaders, signaling a direct diplomatic push to resolve the conflict, with the potential for millions of lives to be saved.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addressed the plight of Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred to Russia during the war, an act for which Putin faces an indictment from the International Criminal Court. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the first lady's efforts, highlighting the issue of what they describe as state-sponsored child trafficking. The gesture underscores ongoing international concern over the thousands of children separated from their families.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both achieved multiple record closes this week, driven by investor optimism following a favorable inflation report. The July consumer price index showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, increasing market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. While a subsequent report on wholesale inflation showed a slight increase, it did not significantly dampen speculation for monetary easing. Several major companies, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Nvidia, also hit all-time stock price highs during the week's trading sessions. (not investment advice)</p>

The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, but a royal source indicated that the move represents a "fresh start" and a "new chapter" following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis. The couple reportedly views Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home" where they can raise their family with more privacy. The move will be funded privately by the couple.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters, developed with the company Steel + Spark, are constructed from four containers arranged in an X-shape, providing five individual, air-conditioned rooms. The project not only offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly housing solution but also gives residents a private, secure space to stabilize their lives. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, also built from shipping containers.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter showdown since the Paris Olympics. At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, narrowly beating Lyles, who finished in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year ago.

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines and trapped him. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is calling for China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States. The technology involves placing large solar power facilities in orbit to convert solar energy into electricity, which is then transmitted to Earth using microwaves or lasers. Unlike ground-based solar, this method is unaffected by weather or nighttime, offering a continuous and more intense energy source. The scientist argues for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current fragmented research efforts and close the technological gap.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic explores the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children, offering support and safety without controlling every aspect of their lives. The piece argues that while parents are biologically wired to prevent their children from suffering, constant intervention can be damaging for kids and exhausting for adults. Instead, being a lighthouse allows children to navigate their own challenges, building confidence and resilience.</p>

A court order granted the forfeiture after the force argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, which the Tate brothers did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million in other funds forfeited by the brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on their online business revenues.

          <p>Therapist Sadie Salazar emphasizes the importance of one simple morning habit for daily success: waking up early, no matter what. By getting up at 7 a.m., she creates a personal window of time before her day officially begins, which she uses for non-work-related activities like reading or walking her dog. Salazar, a self-described recovering perfectionist, avoids a rigid routine for this time, instead allowing herself the flexibility to choose a rejuvenating activity in the moment. This practice helps her feel grounded and creative rather than rushed and chaotic.</p>
