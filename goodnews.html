          <p>As Pride Month concluded, major cities around the world, including New York, San Francisco, and Budapest, hosted large-scale marches that combined celebration with pointed protest. In the U.S., many events took on a defiant tone in response to recent political attacks and policies targeting the LGBTQ+ community, with New York's theme being "Rise Up: Pride in Protest." In Budapest, tens of thousands marched in defiance of a government ban on such events. The global demonstrations underscored a dual focus: celebrating identity and joy while continuing the fight for equal rights and inclusion against a backdrop of increasing challenges.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered a fractured skull after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center cared for the cub for nearly five months, focusing on medical treatment while carefully preserving its wild instincts. The team worked to ensure the animal did not become comfortable around people, a critical factor for its survival. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural behaviors, the cub was released by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife into a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains.</p>

          <p>The thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, continues to captivate enthusiasts in Australia, with thousands of reported sightings despite the animal being declared extinct in 1986. This article explores the national obsession, following dedicated seekers who spend significant time and money using trail cams and searching for evidence in the Tasmanian bush. The story also delves into a high-tech "de-extinction" project backed by millions in funding, which aims to bring the creature back by editing the DNA of its closest living relative. The enduring hope reflects a mix of folklore, passion, and perhaps remorse for the predator's original extinction.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' celebration of franchise legend Candace Parker was dampened by a 92-85 loss to her former team, the Chicago Sky. Before an adoring crowd at Crypto.com Arena, Parker's No. 3 jersey was retired, making her just the third player in Sparks history to receive the honor. On the court, however, Sky rookie Angel Reese dominated with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle. The game's outcome was a bittersweet note on a day dedicated to honoring one of the WNBA's all-time greats.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted the ban on Japanese seafood imports that was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The reversal follows an agreement to improve bilateral ties and is based on Chinese customs authorities' assessment that long-term international monitoring showed no abnormalities. While the blanket ban is lifted, restrictions on food from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, will remain in place. The resumption of trade is conditional on Japanese facilities meeting registration and radiation check requirements.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a US expert on Chinese law, reflects on the current state of US-China relations, drawing comparisons to the period 30 years ago following the disruptions of 1989. In an interview, he notes that just as American students and scholars are cautiously returning to China now after the pandemic, a similar "pioneer" dynamic existed in the mid-1990s. He observes that despite immense changes in China, the current moment feels like a similar period of re-engagement after a rupture. Mahboubi highlights the warm reception his students recently received, suggesting a desire for connection despite high-level political friction.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance in a 5-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals, pitching six scoreless innings in a bulk relief role. The 24-year-old left-hander, who struggled earlier in the season, has shown significant improvement, particularly with an increase in his fastball velocity. On Sunday, he allowed just three hits and one walk while striking out six, including a key punchout of Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. Wrobleski's recent surge is providing the Dodgers with valuable pitching depth and raising his stock within the organization's hierarchy of young talent.</p>
