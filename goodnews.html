        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Kirp argues that 'anticipatory compliance' with Donald Trump's potential policies paves the way for autocracy, citing examples of universities, law firms, and corporations preemptively censoring themselves or abandoning DEI programs. He proposes a counter-strategy of 'anticipatory noncompliance,' highlighting instances where institutions and individuals are pushing back against Trump's demands. Examples include universities challenging demands, states contesting civil rights law interpretations, and consumers boycotting companies that scale back diversity programs. The author emphasizes the need for sustained resistance through various tactics to restore democracy, urging citizens to actively challenge unconstitutional actions and corporate toadying. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A network of women in Latin America has transformed access to safe, self-managed abortions by spreading information about misoprostol, a drug initially designed to treat stomach ulcers, but found to induce abortion. Activists shared knowledge of the drug at feminist gatherings, established hotlines, and created manuals to provide women with information and support throughout the abortion process, often in countries where abortion was legally restricted. In Mexico, activists started 'acompa√±amiento,' which means accompanying a woman throughout her abortion process, regardless of legal risks. These efforts led to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, and the Socorristas en Red, an Argentinian accompaniment network, has become international experts on self-managed abortion with pills. </p>
