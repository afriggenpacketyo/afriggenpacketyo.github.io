          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin recounts her journey of finding love and reinventing her life after the sudden death of her first husband when she was 26. Initially believing she wouldn't remarry, she later reconnected with and married Steve Hasty, who encouraged her to pursue new, ambitious dreams. This support led her to transition from a traditional therapy practice to a successful career as a full-time author and speaker. Together, they embraced a complete lifestyle change, now living on a sailboat in the Florida Keys, a life she had never previously imagined for herself.</p>

          <p>The US Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This substantial prize ranks as the fifth-largest in the history of the game, continuing a winless streak that began on May 31. Winners have the option to receive the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or choose a lump-sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the astronomical odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million, the massive jackpot continues to attract widespread participation across 45 states.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details recent advancements in chronic pain research that focus on the brain as a primary source. The article highlights a shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience to identify objective biomarkers for subjective pain. This approach has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of pain and even use deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt pain signals before they intensify. While not yet widely available, these innovations demonstrate that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering hope for future non-surgical therapies.</p>

          <p>An exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History is highlighting the little-known story of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a military school near Santa Cruz. They fashioned surfboards from local redwood, replicating the koa and ulu boards they used at home, and demonstrated the royal sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their exhibition of "surfboard swimming" was documented in a local newspaper and inspired locals to take up the activity, planting the seeds for the sport's future popularity in America.</p>

          <p>Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's Chief Operating Officer, is leading the company's strategic shift from a consumer-focused phenomenon into a dominant enterprise-level business. Having joined in 2018 as the first business hire, Lightcap is now overseeing a major global expansion, with new offices in Brazil, Australia, and India to meet growing corporate demand. He has rapidly scaled the go-to-market team to over 700 people to help clients like Moderna and Morgan Stanley integrate OpenAI's models into their workflows. The article also touches on the complex dynamic with key partner and investor Microsoft, as the two companies increasingly compete in the enterprise AI space.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader initiative against single-use plastics, the Australian state of South Australia is banning the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The iconic packets, a staple in sushi takeaways, are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process effectively. This ban builds on previous legislation targeting plastic bags and straws, aiming to protect marine life and reduce pollution, as officials warn the flow of plastic into oceans could otherwise triple by 2040.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of the U.S. Open's signature cocktail, the Honey Deuce, has risen faster than the general rate of inflation over the past decade. Currently priced at $23, the vodka-based drink has seen its cost increase by 53% since 2015, when it was sold for $15. In comparison, the Consumer Price Index, a broad measure of inflation, has risen by about 36% over the same period. Despite its high price, the cocktail remains incredibly popular, with over 550,000 sold last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue for the tennis championship event.

          <p>For over five decades, painter Alex Katz has found his primary artistic inspiration in his wife, Ada, whom he has depicted in approximately 300 portraits. An exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 of these works, tracing their 50-year marriage of art and life. Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement, stayed true to his own brand of realism, with Ada as his central subject. Curators note his interest is less in emotional depth and more in style, fashion, and the interplay of light and form, creating detached portraits that he says act like a mirror, allowing viewers to see themselves.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay addresses the common feeling of guilt or misery experienced when personal success coincides with widespread global suffering. The author draws on ancient philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, where one member's pain is felt by all. However, the piece argues that this concept also implies a shared experience of joy, a concept known as "mudita" or sympathetic joy. It suggests that to avoid cynicism or depression, individuals should allow themselves to feel both the world's pain and its joys, recognizing that embracing moments of happiness is a form of resistance against despair.</p>

          <p>The IRS has provided guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, even if they don't take possession of the vehicle by the September 30 cutoff date. According to the new document, a taxpayer is eligible if they enter into a "written binding contract" to purchase an electric vehicle and make a payment on or before the deadline. This allows buyers to order a vehicle, sign a contract, and put down a deposit before the program expires, and still claim the credit when the car is delivered later. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has led to significant shortages and price hikes, even in its home country of Japan. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction, and retailers have doubled their prices over the last year. Japan's aging farming community is struggling to keep up with the labor-intensive cultivation process, prompting the government to consider subsidies. Major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated divisions to manage the supply chain bottleneck, while some cafes are educating consumers on using different grades of matcha.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay draws on a 1995 speech by Toni Morrison to argue that the historical struggle of Black Americans offers crucial lessons for combating the rise of fascism today. Morrison identified fascism not as a sudden leap but as a series of steps, including inventing an enemy and criminalizing them, a process she called the "succubus twin" of racism. The author contends that Black history is a story of resisting this racial fascism through unwavering belief in democratic ideals, diverse methods of resistance, and profound faith. This legacy provides a powerful model for confronting current authoritarian threats, urging a fight that is both political and cultural.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval ratings are at a 30-year low, some strategists see reasons for optimism, primarily due to President Trump's own increasing unpopularity. The analysis suggests a recovery plan focused on rallying public opposition to Trump, emphasizing economic issues like affordability, and organizing for midterm elections. A new generation of leaders like Gavin Newsom and J.B. Pritzker are emerging as vocal opponents, and polls show a slight Democratic lead for congressional races. The party is currently debating its direction, particularly on how to reconnect with working-class voters and navigate divisive cultural issues, but the primary motivator for voters may ultimately be opposition to the other side.</p>
