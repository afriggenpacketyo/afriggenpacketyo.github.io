Rather than being a destabilizing force repeating past disruptions, China is positioned as a primary builder of the world's green energy future in sectors like electric vehicles, solar, and wind power. The article highlights that China installed more solar capacity in 2023 than the rest of the world combined and is driving down clean energy costs globally.

          <p>The world-famous Barbie doll has its origins in a German comic strip character named Lilli, who was created in 1952 for the tabloid newspaper Bild to appeal to male readers. Lilli was portrayed as a sensual, high-class call girl and was later turned into a plastic doll in 1955, sold in bars and tobacco shops as a gag gift for men. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll while on vacation in Switzerland, bought the rights, and redesigned it for the American market, launching Barbie in 1959.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes a podcast interview with Mo Amer, the creator and star of the Netflix comedy series "Mo." The show draws heavily from Amer's own life as a Palestinian-American, exploring the complexities of the U.S. immigration system and the longing to return to a homeland. The discussion covers the experience of creating a sitcom based on personal and often fraught realities. It also touches on how Amer has been thrust into the role of a spokesperson for the Palestinian-American community, especially given the current political moment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing jumped 23% in the past week, reaching its highest level since April of the previous year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge was driven by a slight decrease in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate to 6.67% and a renewed interest in riskier adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which saw a 25% increase in applications. While homeowners are actively seeking to lower their payments, the lower rates did little to spur new home purchases, with purchase applications rising only 1%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from the University of Science and Technology of China has developed the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing, a significant advance in the field. The scientists created an AI-driven system capable of arranging over 2,000 rubidium atoms, which act as qubits, into perfect patterns with unprecedented speed. This achievement overcomes a major obstacle for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a promising approach due to the stability and control of neutral atoms. The milestone has been hailed as a major leap forward for large-scale quantum computation.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, explores the mysterious disappearance of 17 children from a suburban town, with suspicion immediately falling on their unmarried teacher, Justine. This review in The Atlantic analyzes how the film taps into a long-standing cultural trope that portrays single women as unstable, dangerous, and a threat to the social order. As the community scapegoats Justine, she emerges as the film's unlikely hero, doggedly investigating the truth. The film is praised for balancing its grim social commentary with dark humor and a resilient central performance.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a major $3 billion, five-year investment to expand its U.S. operations, which will add over 1,000 jobs and shift some production back to American plants. The plan involves moving the manufacturing of certain gas ranges from Mexico to Georgia and six refrigerator models from China to Alabama. Additionally, production of electric water heaters and some washing machines will be reshored from China to facilities in South Carolina and Kentucky, respectively. The company cited a long-term strategy of manufacturing close to its customers as the primary driver.</p>

While other companies like OpenAI and Yahoo have expressed interest, Perplexity's unsolicited bid is the first formal offer.

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of ancient whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, from a well-preserved 26-million-year-old skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast in Australia. The creature was about the size of a modern dolphin but was a fearsome predator with a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth, unlike its distant, filter-feeding modern relatives. The species was named after Ross Dullard, the local resident who discovered the fossil while walking on the beach in 2019. The discovery adds to the understanding of early whale evolution in a region known for its rich fossil deposits.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic reviews the reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill," which returns after more than 15 years with protagonist Hank Hill moving back to his old neighborhood. The review argues that the show's focus on neighborly relations and strong social ties feels like a comforting, almost fantastical ideal in today's politically fragmented America. While the show touches on modern annoyances, it largely avoids divisive culture-war topics, instead reaffirming its core message that belonging to a community is a worthwhile commitment. This focus on tolerance and mutual support makes the show's world feel both appealing and distant from reality.</p>
