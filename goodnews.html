          <p>A team led by Professor Li Hongge at Beihang University in Beijing has achieved a breakthrough in computing by starting mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip. This innovation overcomes the power and architecture walls faced by traditional chip technologies by merging binary and stochastic logic. The new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system enables unprecedented fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications, such as touch displays and flight systems. This development could also potentially sidestep US chip restrictions, marking a significant advancement in China's technological capabilities.</p>
