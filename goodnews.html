          <p>A California jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a lawsuit filed by a security guard who accused her of assault and battery. The guard, Emani Ellis, alleged that the incident occurred at a doctor's office in 2018 and left her with a facial cut, seeking significant damages. Cardi B testified that while a heated argument took place over privacy concerns during her pregnancy, it never became physical. After a brief deliberation, the jury found in favor of the rapper, concluding a trial that had gained widespread public attention.</p>

          <p>Retired UFC star Jon Jones has been cleared of charges related to a traffic incident in New Mexico after prosecutors formally dismissed the case. Jones had been accused of fleeing the scene of an accident in February, an allegation he consistently denied. His attorney stated that newly disclosed cell phone records proved Jones was not near the crash site, suggesting the accusation was falsely made by an intoxicated driver to avoid a DWI charge. The legal team expressed gratitude for the district attorney's review while noting concern over how the initial investigation was handled by police.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, can resume her position after being fired by former President Donald Trump. The court decided that FTC commissioners are protected from being removed by a president without cause, upholding nearly a century of legal precedent designed to insulate the agency from political influence. The 2-1 decision rejected the Trump administration's request to delay the ruling, allowing Slaughter to return to her role at the agency responsible for enforcing antitrust and consumer protection laws. The legal dispute is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that Google will not be required to sell its Chrome web browser as part of the remedy in a major antitrust case. However, the court ordered the company to share certain search data with its competitors and barred it from entering into exclusive default search engine contracts. The Department of Justice had sought a forced sale of Chrome after Judge Amit Mehta found last year that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in the online search market. The ruling is seen as a partial victory for Google, allowing it to keep key assets while imposing new restrictions.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Power and the Palace" by Valentine Low, details a series of claims about the British royal family's interactions with the political world and private lives. Among the anecdotes, the book alleges that Queen Camilla fought off a sexual assault as a teenager and that the late Queen Elizabeth II was privately in favor of remaining in the European Union. The book also describes negotiations over royal funding and the government's desire for a "maximalist" coronation for King Charles III. These revelations provide a behind-the-scenes look at the monarchy's relationship with power and politics.</p>

          <h2>Google's Stock Surges Over 8% as Antitrust Penalties Are Seen as Less Severe Than Feared</h2>

          <p>Alphabet's stock price jumped more than 8% after a federal judge issued remedies in its landmark antitrust case that were less severe than investors had anticipated. While the court found Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, it rejected the Department of Justice's most drastic proposal to force the sale of the Chrome browser. The ruling does impose new limits on Google's exclusive distribution contracts and requires it to share some search data with rivals. The market's positive reaction suggests relief that the company will avoid a structural break-up of its core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Authorities Warn of Rise in Parking Fine Scams and Offer Prevention Tips</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 19:37:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police forces and councils across the UK are issuing new warnings about an increase in parking-related scams, from fraudulent text messages to tampered payment machines. Scammers often send texts with urgent language and links to fake payment websites to panic victims into sharing financial details. Another common tactic involves placing "skimming" devices on parking machines to steal card information. To stay safe, officials advise verifying that any fine notice includes specific vehicle, time, and location details, never clicking on unsolicited links, and inspecting payment machines for any signs of tampering before use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals. The legislation also targets Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures to prevent the illicit drug trade. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Barr, the bill reflects a congressional effort to hold China accountable for its role in the U.S. opioid crisis. While supporting the bill, some Democrats emphasized that sanctions alone are insufficient and that effective diplomacy and law enforcement partnerships are also crucial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles for domestic law enforcement purposes was a violation of the Posse Comatus Act. The 1878 law generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian policing. During the trial, testimony revealed that a senior military commander's loyalty was questioned when he raised concerns about the legality and risks of the operation. The ruling is a significant rebuke of the administration's broad interpretation of presidential power and sets a precedent against using military personnel for routine law enforcement in U.S. cities.</p>

          <h2>New Green Party Leadership in UK Signals Potential Shift in Left-Wing Politics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The election of Zack Polanski as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales may reshape the landscape of left-wing politics in the UK. Polanski's brash and direct communication style contrasts with the more traditional approach of his rivals and could attract voters disillusioned with the Labour Party. However, this shift also presents challenges, as his left-wing focus might alienate more moderate or conservative-leaning voters in rural areas where the party recently gained ground. The development could lead to increased competition for voters among various left-wing factions, including a potential new party from Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals via a walkover after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew from their quarter-final match due to a knee injury. The withdrawal sets up a highly anticipated semifinal clash between Sabalenka and American fourth seed Jessica Pegula, a rematch of last year's final. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, has had a career marked by injuries and was unable to risk aggravating her current condition.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights how a winner's location can significantly affect their take-home prize. States with no income tax on lottery winnings, such as Florida and Texas, offer the highest potential payout after federal taxes are withheld. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the smallest return. The data also identifies the most and least frequently drawn numbers over the past 100 drawings, though officials emphasize that each drawing is a random and independent event.</p>
