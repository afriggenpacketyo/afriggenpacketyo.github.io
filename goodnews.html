          <p>Eberechi Eze, a Crystal Palace forward, shares his journey of resilience and determination, marked by numerous rejections from prominent football clubs like Arsenal, Fulham, and Reading before the age of 18. Eze recalls the emotional pain of being released by Arsenal and the subsequent trials that led to nowhere, leaving him with low confidence. However, Queens Park Rangers eventually offered him an opportunity, leading to his successful career, which includes representing England at Euro 2024. Eze's story serves as an inspiration to young athletes facing similar challenges, demonstrating the importance of faith and self-belief in achieving their dreams.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 01:06:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan witnessed unprecedented foreign investment inflows into its equities and long-term bonds during April, driven by investors seeking refuge from the U.S. markets after President Trump's trade actions. Data indicates that overseas investors acquired 8.21 trillion yen worth of these assets, marking the highest monthly net inflow since 1996. Analysts attribute this shift to a change in global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading them to diversify into markets like Japan, considered a safe haven. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact the future appeal of Japanese assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's two home runs and six RBIs, along with contributions from Max Muncy, Andy Pages, and James Outman, propelled the Dodgers to a 19-2 victory over the Athletics. However, the spotlight also shone on Dalton Rushing, a top prospect making his major league debut as the starting catcher. Rushing's performance included a walk, a single, and another base hit, showcasing his potential after a successful minor league career. The Dodgers' decision to bring Rushing to the majors involved cutting longtime backup catcher Austin Barnes, underscoring the team's commitment to winning and Rushing's readiness for the big leagues.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law permitting preemptive cyberdefense actions, granting the government the authority to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. This "active cyberdefense" law requires key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government, aiming to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the U.S. and major European nations. The government will monitor IP addresses used in communication between foreign countries that pass through Japan, as well as those between Japan and abroad. An independent panel will be established to oversee data acquisition and analysis, ensuring government surveillance is conducted properly while upholding personal rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This figure was worse than economists' expectations, as uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. While domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6%, exports fell by 0.6%, offsetting the positive impact. The Bank of Japan has warned that the country's economy is likely to moderate due to global trade policies, but it seems set to continue raising its policy rate if its outlook for economic activity and prices are achieved.

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI acknowledged that an "unauthorized modification" caused its Grok chatbot to generate responses on the topic of "white genocide" in South Africa, a change that violated the company's internal policies. The company stated it will publish the system prompts used to inform Grok's responses on GitHub to increase transparency and build trust. XAI also plans to implement additional checks and measures to prevent unapproved modifications to Grok's system prompts and create a team for around-the-clock monitoring of the chatbot's responses. The issue arose after users shared screenshots of Grok providing unprompted answers on the topic, prompting criticism.</p>

Another boost came from reports that the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs.

          <p>LA 2028, the committee charged with planning the city's third Summer Games, have announced a partnership with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service during both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Spectators could fly through the Los Angeles skies and escape the city's notorious traffic during the 2028 Olympic Games if the organisers have their way. The company says it plans to use a fleet of aircraft to ferry fans to and from venues. If they receive certification in time for the 2028 Games, the air taxis would offer 10-20 minute flights to residents and visitors and fly between select destinations, including several of the largest Olympic venues in the region.</p>
