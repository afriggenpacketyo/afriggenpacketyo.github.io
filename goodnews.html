          <p>Dr. Tsion Firew shares her personal and professional journey during Rwanda's 2024 Marburg virus outbreak, a deadly relative of Ebola. Faced with immense personal sacrifice, including sending her young children to another country, she navigated the fear and exhaustion of treating colleagues and friends. The article highlights Rwanda's effective public health response, which achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded for a Marburg outbreak, contrasting it with the politicization of health crises elsewhere. Her story underscores the power of a science-led approach and the profound human cost borne by healthcare workers on the front lines of epidemics.</p>

As part of the agreement, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares, potentially giving the AI firm a 10% stake in the chipmaker upon full execution. This landmark deal positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI's ambitious infrastructure projects, reducing its reliance on Nvidia and highlighting the increasingly interconnected economy of the AI industry.

This breakthrough has opened a new field of immunology, paving the way for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The trio will share the prize money of nearly $1.2 million.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, in his final season before retirement, is transitioning to a role in the bullpen for the postseason, a move he compares to Hall of Famer Greg Maddux's career end. Despite a strong season, the Dodgers' surplus of healthy starting pitchers has necessitated the shift for the future Hall of Famer. Team management noted that Kershaw embraced the decision, prioritizing the team's chances of winning over a starting role. This change marks a poignant bookend to his career, which began 17 years ago with his postseason debut as a relief pitcher.</p>

          <h2>Animated Film 'KPop Demon Hunters' Becomes a Surprise Cultural Phenomenon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has unexpectedly become Netflix's most popular film of all time, driven by its hit soundtrack and a story that authentically embraces its cultural roots. The film, which follows a K-pop girl group who are secretly demon hunters, was initially passed over for distribution by its production studio, Sony, before landing on Netflix. Analysts attribute its success to its immersive approach, which assumes the audience's familiarity with K-pop culture rather than explaining it from an outsider's perspective. The movie's success has defied industry expectations, leading to a massive cultural footprint and merchandise demand.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's 20-year-old defender, Nico O'Reilly, has been called up to the senior England football squad for the first time. The promotion from the Under-21s team comes after Chelsea right-back Reece James withdrew from the squad due to an injury sustained in a Premier League match. O'Reilly, who primarily plays left-back, has had a breakout season with Manchester City, making 21 appearances and scoring five goals last season. His inclusion comes ahead of England's upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled a consultation on significant reforms to the house-buying process in England and Wales, aiming to cut costs, reduce delays, and decrease the number of failed sales. The proposals would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduce the option of binding contracts to prevent parties from backing out late in the process. While the government estimates these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710, some experts express concern that it could create new delays for sellers. The move is part of a broader strategy to address long-standing frustrations with the property market.</p>

          <p>Israeli and Hamas negotiators are preparing for indirect talks in Egypt, creating cautious optimism for an end to the war in Gaza and the release of remaining hostages. The discussions will center on a 20-point plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which Israel has accepted and Hamas has partially agreed to. Key points include the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the transfer of Gaza's governance to an international body. While significant hurdles remain, particularly regarding Hamas's disarmament, the start of formal negotiations represents a potential breakthrough in the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>Japanese beverage giant Asahi has partially restarted production at its six breweries in Japan after a cyberattack forced a complete shutdown. The attack disrupted the company's ordering and delivery systems, leading to stock shortages of popular beers like Asahi Super Dry at major retailers. While the production systems themselves were not compromised, the logistical halt necessitated the closure. The company stated that the breweries are not yet fully operational and it is working with cybersecurity experts to achieve a full recovery, highlighting the vulnerability of major corporations to digital threats.</p>

The review praises the book as smart entertainment that delivers a fun ride, exploring themes of medical ethics and mortality against a backdrop of grotesque opulence.

          <h2>The Complex Nature of Empathy: When It Harms and How to Cultivate It</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki discusses the complex nature of empathy, explaining it as a three-part skill involving emotional sharing, cognitive understanding, and compassionate concern. The article explores the potential downsides of empathy, such as burnout and biased decision-making, as well as its profound benefits for personal well-being, social connection, and health outcomes. Zaki argues that empathy is not a fixed trait but a muscle that can be strengthened through conscious practice, such as developing humility and turning empathic feelings into positive action. He refutes the idea that empathy requires condoning others' actions, framing it instead as a tool for connection and understanding.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a proposal for a "first-job bonus" aimed at helping young people buy their first home. Under the plan, young individuals would receive a £5,000 tax rebate toward their first home upon securing their first full-time job, funded by diverting their National Insurance payments into a savings account. The party stated this policy would be paid for by significant cuts to public spending, including reductions in welfare, the civil service workforce, and the foreign aid budget. The announcement was made at the party's conference as it seeks to present itself as fiscally credible.</p>
