Investors are still betting on tech through broad market index funds, where tech stocks represent a significant portion. Despite volatility, experts suggest investors are becoming more accustomed to market fluctuations and are using traditional hedging strategies.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes of de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both fell by over 7%, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. The market selloff indicates that investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some analysts suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. The situation remains fluid, but the initial market reaction reflects a sense of reduced immediate risk. </p>

          <p>Retired Gen. Robert Spalding, a former B-2 pilot, shared details about the "Operation Midnight Hammer" strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, emphasizing a decade of planning and complex deception tactics. The operation involved the largest-ever deployment of B-2 stealth bombers and the first use of 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs in combat. The mission relied on keeping Iran unaware of the attack, using decoy bombers and accounting for potential data leaks from smartphones. The B-2's stealth capabilities and the pilots' rigorous training were crucial to the mission's success. </p>

          <p>Homeowners should carefully consider their options when borrowing against home equity this summer, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon. Understanding the differences between home equity loans and HELOCs is crucial, as is shopping around for the best rates and terms. It's important to use home equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-interest debt, rather than discretionary spending. Taking these steps can help homeowners improve their financial standing while utilizing their home equity wisely. (not investment advice)</p>
