          <h2>Cartier-Owner Richemont Reports Slowdown in Japan as Yen Strengthens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 03:44:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods company Richemont, which owns Cartier, has reported a 15% sales decline in Japan for its fiscal first quarter, a sharp reversal from last year's 59% jump. The downturn is attributed to a strengthening Japanese yen, which has reduced spending by tourists, particularly from China, who were previously drawn by the weaker currency. Despite the slump in Japan and its watch division, the company's overall revenue grew by 6%, driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry brands like Van Cleef & Arpels.</p>

          <p>The England cricket team has been fined and docked two World Test Championship points for maintaining a slow over rate during their recent victory against India at Lord's. The penalty, imposed by match referee Richie Richardson, caused England to drop from second to third place in the championship standings. Captain Ben Stokes accepted the verdict, which fines players five percent of their match fee for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart International, the creator of the popular Labubu toy line, fell by over 6% despite the company forecasting a profit increase of at least 350% for the first half of 2025. This negative market reaction suggests investors may believe the company's explosive growth has peaked and are taking profits. Analysts express caution, viewing the stock as potentially overvalued due to uncertainty about the long-term popularity of its intellectual properties, even as the company credits its success to global brand recognition and cost optimization.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the NHS in England has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over their roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and a prohibition on diagnosing patients to clearly distinguish them from doctors. This follows tragic cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors, prompting calls for greater clarity and safety in these expanding healthcare roles.</p>
