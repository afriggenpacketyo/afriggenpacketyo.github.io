          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee has criticized organizations that defend members under tax investigations, stating that such actions pressure authorities and expose their "ugly nature." Lee's remarks came in response to concerns about recent tax reviews on members of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, where at least 20 members were asked to prepay about HK$1 million. Lee emphasized that no one has the right to evade taxes, regardless of their profession, and that tax evasion could result in imprisonment. He reiterated the government's commitment to pursuing legal responsibility in accordance with the law.</p>

Lee outlined areas for improvement, emphasizing the need for prevention over rectification. The rail operator, majority-owned by the government, was fined HK$19.2 million following its third disruption in four months due to technical failures.

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth accelerating despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% compared to a year earlier, driven by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Beijing's efforts to support the private sector have helped offset some of the negative impacts from U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry increased by 9%, while household appliance manufacturers saw profits improve by over 15% due to a consumer subsidy scheme. (not investment advice)</p>

The series concludes with June starting to write the story that is the book, highlighting the circular nature of the narrative. Moss also notes that the ending is not truly an ending, as the war is not over and June's journey continues, with the story set to pick up 15 years later in "The Testaments."</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged this year due to economic uncertainty and safe investment demand. Central banks' purchases of gold have increased fivefold since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, marking a turning point in how they view the asset. Countries are experimenting with gold-backed digital assets and trading systems to bypass the dollar-denominated financial system. Gold is also being used by U.S. adversaries to evade sanctions or finance activities that counter U.S. national security interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has decided to allocate 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer amid rising inflation. This measure is part of a larger relief package designed to counter the adverse economic impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly on the auto industry. The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills, with critics suggesting the measures are aimed at boosting government support ahead of elections. The program aims to support companies and alleviate the financial burden on households.</p>
