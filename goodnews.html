          <p>The government is considering introducing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, including a potential two-hour cap on individual app usage and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones, noting the need to define a healthy online life for children and remove barriers to achieving it. Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, whose daughter took her own life after seeing harmful content online, criticized the government's delays in enacting tougher online safety laws, emphasizing the need for legislation that prioritizes safety over engagement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pomona College is seeing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the pervasiveness of technology on campus, with initiatives like tech-free classes, a Luddite Club, and students opting for flip phones. This pushback is driven by concerns that ubiquitous technology detracts from the close-knit community and learning environment that small residential liberal-arts colleges aim to foster. While acknowledging the need for technological literacy, proponents argue that limiting technology can enhance critical thinking and in-person interactions, differentiating Pomona from other institutions that emphasize tech access. The article explores the challenges and potential benefits of creating tech-free spaces within a modern college setting.</p>

The author, reflecting on their upbringing during Mao Zedong's era, notes that the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing on governance. This shift, coupled with China's rise as a global power, has diminished the perceived dangers of American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party through peaceful means.</p>

          <p>The poem, "Under a Supermoon," explores themes of perseverance, appreciation for the minute details of life, and the acceptance of life's exploding and birthing stars.

The speaker slows down and rejoices in the small things, recalling Blake's wisdom that a fool who persists in their folly becomes wise, suggesting a journey of endurance and finding meaning in the present moment.</p>
