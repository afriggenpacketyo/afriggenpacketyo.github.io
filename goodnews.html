          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has labeled President Trump's rhetoric on crime as "purely performative," firmly rejecting the president's offer to deploy federal troops to Baltimore. Moore argued that the administration's approach, which included federalizing D.C.'s police and deploying the National Guard there, is "not scalable," "unsustainable," and "unconstitutional" for other major American cities. He highlighted Baltimore's significant 22% decrease in homicides in 2025, attributing it to state investments in law enforcement and community efforts, and invited Trump to a public safety walk to discuss effective strategies. The governor emphasized that addressing crime requires proper resource allocation and proven tactics, not "theatrics" or "1980s scare tactics" from the Oval Office.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago political leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker, have strongly condemned President Trump's suggestion to deploy National Guard troops to the city to combat crime. Mayor Johnson labeled the approach "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound," warning it could "inflame tensions" and violate the Constitution, while highlighting a significant drop in Chicago's violent crime rates, including a 30% reduction in homicides. Governor Pritzker called Trump's threat a "test of the limits of his power and a trial run for a police state," asserting that Illinois had not requested federal intervention and that no emergency warrants such a deployment. This mirrors similar rejections from other "Blue States" regarding Trump's federalization of the D.C. police and deployment of the National Guard there.</p>

Summerfest, billed as the world's largest music festival, showcased 600 artists over nine days at 14 venues, featuring acts like Def Leppard, Hozier, and Benson Boone.

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York expressed strong opposition to gerrymandering, advocating for a nationwide ban and term limits to reform a "broken" Congress. He also addressed President Trump's threat to deploy National Guard troops to cities like New York, acknowledging the city's crime problems but emphasizing the need for prosecution and enforcement, not just federal deployments. Lawler further discussed the White House's plan to acquire a 10% stake in Intel, stating that while generally against government ownership in private companies, he sees it as a national security issue for semiconductor manufacturing and an attempt to secure a return on taxpayer investment.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish made a significant impact in his Everton debut, inspiring a 2-0 victory over Brighton at the club's magnificent new Hill Dickinson Stadium. On loan from Manchester City, Grealish, who will turn 30 in September, provided two assists within 52 minutes, matching his total from the last two Premier League campaigns. His performance, characterized by a renewed desire to take on defenders and carry the ball, earned him a standing ovation from over 50,000 fans. Manager David Moyes praised Grealish's immediate quality, marking an ideal start for both the player, who is motivated to impress England coach Thomas Tuchel for the upcoming World Cup, and the club as it embarks on a hopeful new era in its state-of-the-art home.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu achieved her first US Open victory since her remarkable 2021 title run, decisively defeating qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 to advance to the second round. This win marks a significant mental hurdle overcome after previous first-round exits and a withdrawal, showcasing her growth and newfound confidence under new Spanish coach Francisco Roig. The British No. 1 played a solid, clean match, minimizing unforced errors even in windy conditions, and effectively rushed her opponent's forehand, forcing a constant stream of errors. This confidence-building grand slam win, her 20th against lower-ranked players in the past year, sets her up for a potentially tougher challenge against the 24th seed, Veronika Kudermetova, in the next round.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, 33, is presenting an ambitious platform that includes significant tax hikes on the wealthy and businesses, free public transportation, universal free child care, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. While these proposals aim to address pressing urban challenges and appeal to a progressive voter base, the article suggests that many of them, like those of other politicians, have little likelihood of becoming tangible. Mamdani's vision is characterized as partly "fabulist," raising questions about the practical implementation and political feasibility of his wide-ranging policy agenda within the complex governance of New York City. The Economist implies a degree of skepticism regarding the attainability of such expansive promises.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of sentencing rules, which could see individuals convicted of crimes barred from pubs and sports matches, alongside driving and travel bans. This legislation, expected next month, aims to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding by restricting short prison sentences and introducing early release schemes for well-behaved inmates, inspired by US models. While Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood ruled out early release for serious offenders, the proposals have raised concerns among former judges and hospitality sectors about implementation and funding. The Ministry of Justice asserts new technology and increased probation officer recruitment will support these reforms.</p>

          <p>Prageeta Sharma's poem, "Irresistible Contentment," from her new book "Onement Won," delves into the speaker's introspective journey to reconnect with the fundamental essence of poetry, moving beyond superficial external expression. The verses vividly describe a yearning for a "golden silence" where the clamor of talk and sound gracefully fades, yet simultaneously acknowledge the "perversely sentient" and often "devilishly wrong" nature of language. The speaker reflects on the nightly hope that speech itself might ultimately reveal its "one true alphabet," leading to a profound, burning understanding. Ultimately, the poem suggests a transformative shift towards a "plateau of nested changes," seeking an "irresistible" inner renewal where letters of gold, perhaps anew, guide the poem's heartfelt core.</p>

Towering sound systems played reggae, dub, and drum and bass, creating an atmosphere of unity and celebration of Caribbean culture, with EastEnders star Rudolph Walker and TV chef Big Zuu among those enjoying the event.

          <p>Biographer Michael Wolff has revealed that during his first administration, President Donald Trump reportedly had confrontations with the Secret Service over his personal sleeping habits. According to Wolff, Trump insisted on installing a lock on his bedroom door, a request the Secret Service denied and subsequently removed the lock, citing crucial security protocols that require their unimpeded access to the president. This particular incident is not new, with similar accounts of Trump's desire for a locked bedroom door having emerged in 2019. Wolff also mentioned a separate, unspecified "fit" Trump had when White House domestic staff changed his sheets, further highlighting the president's reportedly unusual preferences regarding his private living arrangements and interactions with staff.</p>

Using an old utility trailer as a foundation, the month-long project prioritized efficiency, featuring a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed in a vaulted loft, and a kitchen area with a mini-fridge and folding faucet. The entire house, including an outdoor shower, is powered by roof-mounted solar panels. Kelly, who has stayed in the house during a snowstorm, demonstrates that creative thinking can yield functional living spaces with minimal square footage, challenging others to build even smaller.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $750 million for Monday's drawing, making it the 10th largest prize in the lottery's history, after no single player matched all numbers drawn on Saturday. The estimated cash value for the upcoming drawing is $338.6 million. Although the top prize went unclaimed, Saturday's drawing did produce several significant winners, including two $1 million tickets sold in Maine and Massachusetts, and one $2 million ticket in South Dakota due to the Power Play option. This marks the 36th consecutive round without a grand prize winner since May 31, driving the jackpot to its current impressive size and generating considerable public interest.</p>
