          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured their first trip to the American League Championship Series since 2016 by defeating the New York Yankees 5-2 in Game 4 of their division series. The victory, which took place at Yankee Stadium, was a result of a strong offensive performance and a strategic bullpen game where eight different pitchers were utilized. Key moments included a pivotal two-run single by Nathan Lukes in the seventh inning that extended Toronto's lead, effectively sealing the game. The Blue Jays will now face the winner of the series between the Seattle Mariners and the Detroit Tigers.</p>

          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, has announced a proposal to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private in a deal valued at over $37 billion. The move caused Hang Seng Bank's shares to surge by nearly 30%, while HSBC's own shares fell over 5% in Hong Kong trading. The offer prices Hang Seng shares at a significant premium over their recent average, reflecting HSBC's strategy to strengthen its presence in Hong Kong and streamline its corporate structure. The deal underscores HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong's status as a key global financial hub connecting international markets with mainland China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The agreement, brokered with the help of Qatar and Egypt, marks a significant step toward ending the two-year conflict. According to a senior White House official, the process will begin with an Israeli cabinet vote, followed by a military repositioning and then a 72-hour window for Hamas to release the hostages. Both Israeli and Hamas officials have publicly confirmed the agreement, expressing gratitude to the mediators involved in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank has agreed to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a move that significantly expands its footprint in artificial intelligence. The announcement caused SoftBank's shares to jump by as much as 13%, as the deal aligns with founder Masayoshi Son's vision for "Physical AI" and "Artificial Super Intelligence." This acquisition is part of a broader strategy by SoftBank to position itself as a central player in the AI revolution, complementing its ownership of chip designer Arm. The deal also means ABB will no longer pursue a separate public listing for its robotics division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from an Orleans Parish jail in May, was captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff with law enforcement. His arrest concludes a multi-agency manhunt that spanned several months for the convicted murderer. Authorities located Groves in the crawl space of a home after receiving a tip through Crime Stoppers and deploying a SWAT team. Groves, who was awaiting sentencing for multiple murders, is expected to be extradited back to Louisiana, where he will face additional charges related to the escape.

          <p>This opinion article argues that a joint bid by cities in China's Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Shenzhen, to host the Olympic Games presents a significant opportunity for regional integration. The author suggests that co-hosting the event would foster social cohesion by breaking down physical and cultural barriers, encouraging collaboration and a shared sense of identity among the distinct communities. Beyond showcasing the region's advanced infrastructure and economic dynamism, the Olympics could serve as a catalyst for inspiring youth and promoting health initiatives. The piece frames the potential bid as a powerful moment to redefine the area's future on a global scale.</p>

          <p>The 20-point peace plan proposed by President Trump outlines a phased approach to ending the Israel-Hamas conflict, beginning with an immediate cessation of hostilities and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw its forces to an agreed-upon line. The plan also calls for the complete demilitarization of Gaza under independent supervision and the establishment of a "technocratic" committee to handle governance, sidelining Hamas. Furthermore, it proposes creating an internationally-backed stabilization force and facilitating a massive influx of humanitarian aid and economic redevelopment for the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>A decade ago, Middle School 50 in Brooklyn was listed as persistently dangerous with declining enrollment, but Principal Benjamin Honoroff has engineered a remarkable turnaround by integrating debate into every class. The former debate coach's strategy has led to significant improvements in academic performance, with proficiency scores in English and math jumping from single digits to 60% and 70%, respectively. The school's debate team has also achieved national success, winning a championship title. By encouraging students to articulate their reasoning in all subjects, the program has deepened their conceptual understanding and fostered a vibrant, prideful school community.</p>

          <p>A former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, who was fired in 2023 amid a contentious dispute over books with LGBTQ+ and sexual themes, has won a $700,000 settlement. Terri Lesley sued the county after her termination, alleging that officials violated her First Amendment rights by siding with community members who demanded the removal of certain books from youth shelves. The county had claimed her dismissal was based on performance, not the book controversy. Lesley stated that she felt vindicated by the settlement and would never regret standing up for constitutional principles and against discrimination in public institutions.</p>

The visit comes amid online speculation about the 79-year-old president's health, fueled by recent images of a bruise on his hand and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency. His last physical in April declared him "fully fit," with his physician citing his golf victories as a contributor to his excellent health. The White House also noted that following the checkup, the president is considering a trip to the Middle East to help finalize the Gaza peace deal.</p>
