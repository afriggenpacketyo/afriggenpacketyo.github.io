          <p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva indicated that Ukrainian President Zelensky appears more willing to engage in peace discussions than in previous meetings, noting a similar sentiment from Putin. Lula emphasized the United Nations' crucial role in leading negotiations, advocating for the organization to regain its authority as a spokesperson for member states. This renewed push for a Brazil-China peace plan follows a rare alignment with the US on a ceasefire initiative in March. The six-point plan includes humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection, previously dismissed by Ukraine as "destructive."</p>

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, with Chinese automaker Chery Automobile's IPO debut up 11% and Xiaomi shares rising after new device launches. South Korea's Kospi was flat, but defense stocks increased, while Taiwan's Taiex fell, impacted by TSMC's decline amid Intel-Apple investment reports. US stock futures remained stable as investors awaited jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, saw its shares jump 11% in its Hong Kong debut after a $1.2 billion IPO, despite canceling its listing ceremony due to a typhoon. The automaker is rapidly expanding in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe, with its Jetour sub-brand entering Europe soon. Industry experts note Chery's growing strength and manufacturing presence in multiple countries, mitigating some risks from tariffs imposed by the US, Canada, and the EU on Chinese EVs. The company's diversified approach positions it well amidst global trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain FEMA grants. This decision is a setback for the administration's efforts to withhold funding from "sanctuary" cities and states. Twenty states, mostly Democratic, argued that tying critical disaster preparedness funds to immigration cooperation violated federal law and the Constitution. The judge found the policy "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the loss of emergency funds would cause irreparable harm.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has temporarily stayed the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm due to an avian flu outbreak. The farm owners, who have vehemently opposed the cull, appealed the order after police briefly arrested them for obstruction. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) had ordered the cull, citing the risk of virus persistence and mutation, but will now maintain custody of the birds pending the appeal. The case has garnered international attention, with figures like US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy intervening.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's massive investment in OpenAI, potentially up to $100 billion, will largely be used by OpenAI to lease Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs). This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread out the significant costs of building AI supercomputing facilities, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. The deal, described as "monumental in size," has raised concerns among some investors about the "circular nature" of AI boom financing, where money flows back to the capital provider. OpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, emphasized the need for partners like Oracle and Nvidia to address the dramatic shortage of compute capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Africa is experiencing a rapid expansion of its solar capacity, driven by a record influx of Chinese-made solar panels. An Oxford Economics study revealed a significant increase in imports, with 9,516 megawatts received in the first seven months of this year, up from 6,625MW last year. This surge, led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, is largely attributed to massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms. The falling costs of Chinese solar technology are enabling the continent to accelerate its transition to renewable energy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen is in disarray with a high ERA, prompting manager Dave Roberts to seek reliable options as the season concludes. Closer Tanner Scott and top right-hander Blake Treinen have struggled significantly, alongside other relievers. Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, 23, is rejoining the active roster after a five-month shoulder injury, unexpectedly becoming a potential playoff relief option. Sasaki's return follows mechanical tweaks and successful minor league appearances, with the team hoping his fresh arm can provide much-needed stability to their struggling relief corps.</p>

          <p>Facing falling cranberry prices and rising operational costs, Massachusetts cranberry farmers are increasingly participating in a state program to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands. This initiative, part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program, pays farmers for the conversion, allowing native plants to return. Over 500 acres have been restored in 15 years, with another 500 planned, offering environmental benefits like water filtration and storm resilience. The program provides a way for farmers to preserve their land and ensure its future, especially as a generation nears retirement.</p>

          <p>Researchers at a UK government lab have made a significant breakthrough in fusion energy, designing an exhaust system that dramatically reduces extreme heat within fusion reactors. This "Super-X divertor" creates a neutral gas buffer, providing more space to cool plasma before it hits reactor walls, crucial for making nuclear fusion practical. This advancement, a collaborative effort, addresses one of fusion's biggest challenges. Fusion energy offers a clean, nearly limitless power source without long-lasting radioactive waste, potentially playing a pivotal role in reducing fossil fuel reliance and accelerating renewable energy adoption.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, with its epicenter located near Mene Grande, an oil town in Zulia state.

Despite the strong temblor, there were no immediate reports of casualties or serious damage. While strong earthquakes are not common in Venezuela, approximately 80% of its population lives in seismic zones, making preparedness a continuous concern for the oil-rich nation.</p>
