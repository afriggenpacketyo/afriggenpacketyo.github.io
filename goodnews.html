          <p>Alibaba's new artificial intelligence model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained global popularity, positioning itself as a major competitor in the AI-assisted coding market. According to data from the AI marketplace OpenRouter, the model's usage share has surpassed 20%, second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. Alibaba claims its tool's performance is on par with the industry leader, attributing its success to extensive training on coding-related data and advanced reinforcement learning. This development comes as Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent are also launching their own AI coding tools.</p>

The talks also covered U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump hinting at providing "good protection" without specifying details. European leaders, particularly Germany's chancellor, pushed back against Trump's suggestion that a ceasefire was not a necessary precondition for further negotiations with Moscow.</p>

          <p>Following a summit with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump announced he had contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin arranging a bilateral meeting. Trump stated that after this initial meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, he would join them for trilateral talks. This development marks a potential breakthrough, as previous attempts to bring the two leaders together have been unsuccessful. While the Kremlin's official statement was more reserved, mentioning an increase in the level of representation in negotiations, Zelenskyy has expressed his readiness for a three-way meeting.</p>

          <h2>MLB Commissioner Suggests Geographic Realignment Could Accompany League Expansion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to geographically realign teams, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking at the Little League World Series, Manfred suggested that grouping teams into Eastern and Western conferences could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason formats. While such a change would likely face resistance from traditionalists, the commissioner argued it could enhance regional rivalries and improve broadcast schedules. The league is reportedly considering Nashville and Salt Lake City as leading candidates for new expansion franchises.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit led by Santa Clara County, California.

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has signed an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called "designer Xanax." The action makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to arrest individuals for its sale or possession. This state-level ban is part of a larger effort led by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is spearheading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to enact a nationwide emergency ban. The drug was linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year.</p>

          <p>A hastily arranged White House meeting brought together President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and several European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. The summit focused on two main points: the possibility of a ceasefire and the nature of future security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump promised "very good protection" for Ukraine and announced he was working to arrange a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a proposal Zelenskyy appeared open to. The meeting's tone was reportedly smoother than a previous tense encounter, but it concluded without concrete steps toward a comprehensive peace deal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for disaster-damaged properties. Currently, when a home is destroyed, insurance funds are often held in an escrow account by the lender, which can keep the accrued interest. This new legislation, now heading to the governor's desk, guarantees homeowners at least 2% interest on these funds while they are held during the rebuilding process. The bill aims to close a loophole in existing law and provide additional financial support to residents recovering from natural disasters.</p>
