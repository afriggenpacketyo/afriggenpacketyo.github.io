          <p>Toyota has announced that the 2026 RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine for the first time, but will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. This decision reflects the increasing popularity and demand for hybrid vehicles, with electrified vehicles accounting for 43.1% of Toyota's U.S. sales in 2024. The redesigned RAV4 will include interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to performance and technologies, and is set to go on sale later this year. Toyota's decision also comes amidst ongoing tariffs on vehicles imported into the U.S., posing challenges for the automaker.</p>
