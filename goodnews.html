          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, some top Wall Street analysts are recommending specific dividend-paying stocks as a source of stable income for investors. Companies such as Chevron (CVX), Rithm Capital (RITM), and AT&T (T) are highlighted for their consistent dividend yields and recent market performance. Analysts point to factors like Chevron's Hess acquisition, Rithm Capital's pivot to an alternative investment model, and AT&T's strong wireless subscriber growth as reasons for their positive outlook. The article presents these recommendations as potential options for investors seeking to bolster their portfolios against market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector is creating new billionaires at a historic pace, marking one of the largest wealth creation events in recent history. Startups like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Anysphere have seen their valuations soar, minting new paper fortunes for their founders and early investors. According to CB Insights, there are now nearly 500 AI "unicorns" valued at over $1 billion each, with a significant concentration of this new wealth in the San Francisco Bay Area. This boom is fueling a resurgence in the local economy, though most of the wealth remains in private companies, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for the wealth management industry.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are holding sales tax holidays in 2025, providing temporary relief for shoppers on specific items like back-to-school supplies and disaster preparedness goods. These events are politically popular, though some tax experts argue they primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their purchases, rather than stimulating broad economic growth. For many middle and lower-income families, however, these holidays offer a crucial opportunity to save on essential, big-ticket items as they face rising costs and potential price hikes from tariffs. Financial advisors suggest combining these tax breaks with other store promotions and rewards programs to maximize savings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a constant stream of negative news, there are many underreported stories of global progress that often go unnoticed due to a psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias. This evolutionary trait hardwires humans to focus more on threats and bad news, which can lead to a skewed, pessimistic worldview. The article argues that highlighting positive developments, such as a falling U.S. murder rate and fewer global deaths from extreme weather, is crucial. Embracing a mindset of realistic optimism is not about ignoring problems, but about fostering the resilience and motivation needed to believe that complex issues are solvable.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite called a chondrite, created a loud boom as it entered the atmosphere in June. Researchers at the University of Georgia analyzed fragments from the home and determined their ancient origins. The incident marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, and scientists believe modern technology and public awareness will lead to more such discoveries, aiding in the study of asteroids.</p>

The landmark, known to exiles as "el refugio" (the shelter), has been restored to its original style and now features interactive exhibits capturing the emotional journeys of those who fled Fidel Castro's regime. The exhibition, named "Libertad," includes hundreds of recorded testimonials from individuals who passed through the tower, sharing memories of their arrival and the challenges of starting a new life. The project aims to preserve this pivotal chapter of Miami's history for future generations.</p>

          <p>In her new book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her experience of living in a "middle place" of recovery from anorexia, a state between acute illness and complete wellness. Tarpley, who developed the disorder at age 11 after her mother's death, discusses how the pressure for a perfect, all-or-nothing recovery was detrimental. She argues that embracing imperfections and accepting that setbacks can happen has been key to living a full life. The book combines memoir with research to explore this nuanced reality, offering a perspective of hope and resilience for those who may never achieve a textbook definition of "full recovery."</p>

          <p>For individuals who struggle with a strict vegetarian or vegan diet but still wish to minimize animal suffering, there are ethically conscious alternatives to consider. This article suggests a "reducetarian" approach, focusing on making informed choices rather than adhering to an absolute rule. Key recommendations include choosing pasture-raised meat over products from factory farms, where animals endure extreme confinement and harsh conditions. Additionally, opting for meat from larger animals like cows over chickens can reduce the total number of lives affected, and selecting wild-caught fish is preferable to those from crowded fish farms, offering a pragmatic path to reducing harm.</p>

          <p>NASA's interim head, Sean Duffy, has directed the agency to develop a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor to be placed on the moon by the end of the decade. This initiative is seen as essential for establishing a permanent, long-term human settlement on the lunar surface, as solar power is insufficient during the 14-day lunar nights. The move is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a joint Chinese-Russian plan for a more powerful lunar reactor. A nuclear-powered moon base would support regular astronaut missions, scientific research, and potentially serve as a stepping stone for grander space exploration ambitions.</p>

          <p>In a cultural review, Atlantic staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker shares his current interests, from literature to music. He recommends Michael Young's 1958 satirical novel "The Rise of the Meritocracy," which critiques a society stratified by educational achievement, a theme he finds relevant today. He also expresses his enjoyment of the TV show "The Bear" for its tender portrayal of human struggle and its tribute to his hometown of Chicago. Additionally, he names Bob Dylan as a significant musical artist and highlights the ambiguous, dramatic nature of Mark Rothko's paintings as a cherished form of visual art.</p>

          <p>Facing threats to its traditional water sources from climate change, Southern California is planning a range of projects to ensure future water reliability and avoid a "Day Zero" crisis. With supplies from the Colorado River and Northern California projected to shrink, water agencies are focusing on diversifying their portfolios. Key strategies include building a massive wastewater recycling facility, capturing more stormwater, and restoring natural watersheds. These initiatives aim to create a more sustainable and resilient local water supply, though they come with significant costs and ongoing debates over investments in new transport infrastructure versus local, nature-based solutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities worldwide face increased flooding due to climate change, some are adopting the "sponge city" model, which uses nature-based solutions to absorb and manage stormwater. This approach, exemplified by a new park in Bangkok, contrasts with traditional "gray" infrastructure that quickly funnels water away. By creating more permeable surfaces, wetlands, and green spaces, cities can capture rainwater, reduce runoff, replenish groundwater, and create recreational areas. Los Angeles is also exploring this model through its Safe Clean Water Program, which funds projects to make the urban landscape more absorbent, though progress faces bureaucratic and financial hurdles.</p>

          <p>Amid the confusion and limitations of recycling, the concept of reusable food and beverage containers is gaining traction as a solution to the waste crisis. An estimated 50 billion single-use coffee cups are discarded annually in the U.S. alone. A recent pilot program in Petaluma, California, tested a city-wide system where customers could use and return reusable cups from various stores at no extra charge. The program, sponsored by major corporations, reported a successful return rate, suggesting that community-wide, incentive-free reuse systems can be more effective for the environment than single-use alternatives, even accounting for washing and transport.</p>
