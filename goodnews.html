          <p>A 10-mile stretch of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened to the public after being closed for years due to storm damage. Heavy rains in 2022 and 2023 caused slope failures, rock slides, and pavement collapse along the road. Further damage occurred in September 2024 due to the Bridge fire. Repairs included new guardrails, retaining walls, erosion control, and drainage systems, costing approximately $7.9 million. The reopening provides access to popular hiking trails and is expected to reduce littering and overcrowding. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked Donald Trump’s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have permission to live and work in the U.S., citing that the plaintiffs are likely to win their claim that the president’s administration’s actions were unlawful. The court upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans. The judges found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of TPS. The article notes that the Trump administration's move was part of a broader effort to reduce the number of immigrants in the country. </p>
