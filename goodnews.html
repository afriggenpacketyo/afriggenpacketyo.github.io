          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans, according to a company source. The plants in question are Nissan's main Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of its subsidiary Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka. These plants account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision to close the plants remains uncertain, as the company has yet to hold talks with labor unions, parts makers, or municipalities. The company is grappling with poor sales in the United States and China.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plan for tariffs on the world, announced on April 2nd, 2025, dubbed "liberation day" by his administration, quickly unraveled. The measures included a blanket 10% tariff on all imported goods and higher rates on specific markets. Global stock markets declined, and business leaders urged reconsideration. After a 90-day pause, tariffs were reinstated on China, but later reduced. The article also describes the impact of the tariffs on business and consumers, as well as the shifting justifications offered by Trump and his administration.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is focusing on voter fraud, with assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Recent charges have been brought against individuals accused of illegal voting, including non-citizens who mistakenly believed they were eligible. While Trump and his allies have claimed widespread non-citizen voting, evidence suggests these are isolated incidents. State audits have found minimal instances of non-citizen voting. The Justice Department press releases credit DOGE with assisting with the investigations into Jamiel and the Demydenkos, but it is not clear what role DOGE played, or whether DOGE also assisted with the arrest of Wallace.</p>

          <p>The article draws parallels between President Trump's approach to budget reconciliation and that of Ronald Reagan in 1981. Reagan's budget featured increases for the Pentagon and cuts to social safety nets, alongside historic tax cuts. This initiative, known as Reaganomics, aimed to reverse the growth of the federal government. The article also notes the presence of an unelected official with significant power, similar to Elon Musk's role in Trump's administration, with David Stockman serving as Reagan's budget director. The article also delves into the origins of budget reconciliation, tracing it back to the Congressional Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974.</p>

          <p>The author argues that the focus should shift from celebrating "rich lists" to addressing the issue of "extreme wealth" and its negative impacts on society. Wealth inequality has increased significantly, with the wealth of the richest far exceeding that of the average person. The author proposes the concept of an "extreme wealth line," suggesting a point beyond which wealth accumulation becomes harmful and should be curbed. They highlight the need for democratic discussions and policy interventions to address wealth inequality before it becomes too late.</p>

The AfD has been classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, but Merz believes it must be proven that the party is actively working against the democratic order.

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election. The outcome of the election will determine whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can take forward its plans, which have been stymied by the current president.
