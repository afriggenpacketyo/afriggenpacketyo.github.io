          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order came after the family was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives is unlawful. Soliman's wife is an Egyptian citizen with a pending EB-2 visa, and the family entered the United States in late August 2022.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels, making it the agency's largest operation of its kind. The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. The Squaxin Island Tribe supports the cleanup, as maintaining clean beaches and water are essential to their culture.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, published in Science Bulletin, details the structural evolution of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. Researchers gained insight into how feathers evolved during this era, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the UK have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth may protect us from dangerous infections. Research shows that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The study, conducted by University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, appeared to have a protective effect.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. It is not known whether taking medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice.</p>
