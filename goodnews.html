          <p>President Donald Trump announced that 600,000 Chinese students will be allowed to study at U.S. colleges, signaling a potential easing of U.S.-China relations amidst ongoing trade negotiations. This statement comes after earlier tariffs and visa restrictions, and a previous plan by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revoke visas for Chinese nationals tied to the Communist Party. Trump emphasized the importance of the student exchange and expressed optimism about improving relations with China, despite recent trade tensions and threats of further tariffs on Chinese goods like magnets. The move marks a notable shift in tone from the administration's earlier stance.</p>

          <p>Korean Air and Boeing announced a deal for 103 new passenger jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models. This agreement comes shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with President Trump, who has been advocating for increased business with American firms amidst U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. Korean Air CEO Walter Cho stated the new aircraft will modernize the fleet and enhance competitiveness as the airline merges with Asiana Airlines. The deal signifies a significant boost for Boeing and could be seen as a positive development in U.S.-South Korea economic relations despite trade tensions.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are urging a $1 billion annual investment from cap-and-trade revenues to support the state's high-speed rail project, which faces suspended federal funds and significant delays. State Senator Dave Cortese emphasized that consistent funding is crucial for the project's continuation. Proponents highlight the project's economic benefits, including creating nearly 15,000 jobs and generating $22 billion in growth, with projections of over a million jobs upon completion of the Los Angeles-San Francisco line. The project, billions over budget and decades behind schedule, is at a "crossroads," requiring long-term financial commitments to overcome past hurdles and secure its future.</p>

Kasatkina, who recently changed allegiances from Russia to Australia, acknowledged personal struggles but found her form in the second set. Joining her in breakout wins are Priscilla Hon, who secured her first Flushing Meadows victory, and Adam Walton, who upset 22nd seed Ugo Humbert for the biggest win of his career. These successes mark significant career milestones and promise their largest paydays yet for the Australian players.</p>

          <h2>Expert Offers Three Dynamic Rules for Improved Back Health and Posture</h2>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a doctor and BBC presenter, challenges outdated notions of good posture, suggesting that rigidly sitting upright can be detrimental. He proposes three key rules for better back health: prioritize movement, build strength, and adopt a healthier mindset. Instead of static positions, he advocates for regular breaks, stretching, and exercises like pilates or yoga to foster dynamic posture. The article emphasizes that back pain is often influenced by stress and lifestyle, not just desk setup, encouraging a holistic approach to well-being.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has once again scrubbed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to adverse weather conditions, following an earlier ground system issue. This mission is crucial for testing corrective upgrades after three previous catastrophic failures and aims to restore confidence in the rocket's viability for future moon missions. The flight plan includes rigorous tests of both stages, such as engine shutdowns and satellite deployment, with a focus on gathering data for reliability. A successful flight is essential for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing, as experts express concerns about the ambitious timeline and the complexities of in-orbit refueling.</p>

          <p>The UK government has approved plans to allow approximately 40 students from Gaza to travel to the UK for funded university scholarships, including nine under the Chevening scheme and about 30 with private funding. This initiative marks the first time Gazan students will be able to leave the territory to study in the UK since the Hamas-Israel war began in 2023. Significant logistical and political challenges remain, including securing Israel's approval for each student's departure and conducting visa checks in a third country. The decision follows extensive campaigning and comes amidst deteriorating UK-Israel relations over the recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, the co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, has entered a guilty plea to drug smuggling and conspiracy charges in a New York federal court. This marks a significant end to one of organized crime's most notorious careers. Zambada, 77 and reportedly in poor health, apologized for his actions, acknowledging the harm illegal drugs caused and admitting to corrupting Mexican officials. His plea comes after U.S. prosecutors confirmed they would not seek the death penalty, and his arrest last year followed an alleged double-cross by the sons of his former ally, 'El Chapo' Guzmán. He is expected to spend the rest of his life in a U.S. federal prison.</p>
