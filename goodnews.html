          <p>President Trump announced on social media his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the new surgeon general, replacing his initial nominee, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Trump praised Means' "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again) credentials and her collaboration with Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to address the chronic disease epidemic. Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, will reportedly work with Kennedy in another capacity within the department. The withdrawal of Nesheiwat's nomination followed scrutiny of her credentials and opposition from conservative activists who deemed her ideologically misaligned with the president.</p>

          <p>The film *Warfare* depicts a day in the Iraq War when Ray Mendoza's Navy SEAL platoon was trapped in a building after an IED injured two teammates. Mendoza, who co-wrote and directed the film with Alex Garland, interviewed platoon members to meticulously reconstruct the events, aiming for authenticity and to help a teammate who lost his memory of that day. The movie focuses on the protocols, emotions, and intense bonds among the soldiers, offering a realistic portrayal of combat rather than perpetuating stereotypes about veterans. For Mendoza and other members of the platoon, revisiting the incident through the film was a therapeutic process.</p>
