          <p>China plans to remove tariffs on nearly all goods from 20 more African countries, excluding eSwatini, offering duty-free access to its consumer market. This initiative was announced during a meeting in China attended by African ministers, coinciding with criticism of the United States' trade policies. Chinese President Xi Jinping stated China's commitment to extending zero-tariff measures to 53 African nations with diplomatic ties, building upon a previous policy benefiting 33 least-developed African countries. Representatives from China and African nations jointly accused the U.S. of disrupting the global economic and trade order. This move underscores China's growing economic influence in Africa.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan to hold colleges accountable for student loan debt by penalizing institutions whose students struggle to repay their loans. The risk-sharing plan would require colleges to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the loan debt their students do not repay. Schools would also be rewarded with PROMISE Grants for providing low-income students with a great value for their money. While the plan aims to incentivize better outcomes for students, concerns have been raised about data limitations and the exclusion of defaulted loans.</p>
