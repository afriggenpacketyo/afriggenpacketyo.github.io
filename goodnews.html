          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, announced plans to upgrade its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. This move aims to significantly lower the cost of electric vehicle batteries, as LFP technology does not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. The upgrade is part of GM's broader strategy to diversify its EV portfolio and scale production of more affordable electric vehicles. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to commence by late 2027, complementing GM's other investments in battery development.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongly convicted of murder at 19, spent over 28 years in a Louisiana prison where he taught himself law and became a "jailhouse lawyer." He provided legal assistance to hundreds of fellow inmates, helping many overturn their convictions while fighting for his own. With the help of the Innocence Project of New Orleans, Duncan was released in 2011 and later fully exonerated after new evidence revealed misconduct by the detectives in his case. Now a law school graduate, he runs the Light of Justice program, continuing his mission to help incarcerated individuals access the justice system.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a massive investment of "hundreds of billions of dollars" into artificial intelligence infrastructure, with the company's first AI supercluster, named Prometheus, set to come online in 2026. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to create industry-leading compute capacity and attract top AI talent to the newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs. The move signals a significant escalation in Meta's AI ambitions, as Zuckerberg aims to revamp the company's approach and compete more effectively with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Several other multi-gigawatt data centers are also in development to support this long-term vision.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has integrated its unofficial "secret menu" into its mobile app, making popular fan-created drink combinations directly available to its rewards members. This initiative introduces four initial customized beverages and streamlines the ordering process for both customers and baristas. The move is part of a broader strategy by CEO Brian Niccol to rejuvenate the brand and improve customer experience, following other changes like simplifying menu offerings and standardizing add-on pricing. To generate excitement, Starbucks is also running a contest for customers to submit their own custom drink ideas for a chance to win a significant cash prize.</p>

          <h2>New Federal Tax Law Reinstating Full Depreciation Expected to Fuel Private Jet Sales</h2>

          <p>A new federal spending bill is anticipated to create a surge in the private jet market by reinstating "bonus depreciation," a significant tax benefit for buyers. This provision allows businesses, including individuals who own jets through a company, to write off 100% of the purchase price of a new or used jet in the first year. Aviation brokers report a spike in interest from clients who were waiting for this tax change, which replaces the previous phased-out depreciation schedule. The stimulus comes as the private jet market has been normalizing after a post-pandemic boom, potentially boosting demand and sales.</p>

          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of long-term versus short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs). While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields, long-term CDs can generate substantially greater total returns due to the extended compounding period. For example, a $5,000 investment in a five-year CD at 4.20% could earn over $1,141, far surpassing the $220 earned from a one-year CD at 4.40%. The decision depends on a saver's financial goals, with short-term CDs offering flexibility and long-term CDs providing a way to lock in high rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer voiced confidence in CEO Brian Niccol's strategy of incremental store-by-store changes, a sentiment echoed by Citi analysts who raised their price target for the coffee giant. Conversely, Cramer supported Melius's "buy" rating for Texas Roadhouse, highlighting it as a rare growth story in the casual dining sector driven by strong customer traffic. He suggested the restaurant's stock, up only 5% year-to-date, represents a high-growth opportunity that investors are keen to get behind. (not investment advice)</p>

The ranking is based on empirical data across various factors, including low crime rates, air quality, health, worker protections, and inclusive laws. Vermont stood out for its strong protections for reproductive rights, which were enshrined in its constitution, and its welcoming policies. Following Vermont in the top five were Maine, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Connecticut, all of which scored highly for safety, health, and inclusiveness, demonstrating the growing economic importance of quality of life.</p>

Svyrydenko, 39, is credited with successfully negotiating a key mineral deal with the United States and has risen quickly through government ranks.

This placement means they will face Sweden in the quarter-finals, avoiding a match-up with historical rivals Germany. More significantly, it places them in the opposite bracket from the reigning World Cup champions and tournament favorites, Spain, whom they cannot meet until a potential final. While Sweden presents a formidable challenge, England's path to the final would then involve a semi-final against either Norway or Italy, creating a more favorable route on paper.</p>

Federal data shows women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured than men, a disparity linked to safety tests that primarily use dummies based on an average male physique. The proposed legislation would require the use of more advanced and diverse crash test dummies, including one simulating a smaller woman. Proponents argue this will provide crucial data to design safer vehicles for all body types, improving auto safety equity.</p>

Some experts suggest that short-term CDs remain a strong option, as banks are keeping their rates competitive in the current environment. Others argue that locking in a high yield with a long-term CD now could maximize earnings before rates fall. For those who are uncertain, building a CD ladder with staggered maturity dates is recommended as a balanced strategy to mitigate interest rate risk while maintaining some liquidity.
