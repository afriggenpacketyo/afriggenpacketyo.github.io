          <p>General Motors announced plans to integrate advanced software initiatives into its vehicles by 2028, including Google's Gemini AI assistant starting next year and a new "eyes-off" driver-assistance system. CEO Mary Barra detailed these efforts, which aim to transform cars into intelligent assistants, alongside a new centralized computing platform and expansion of GM Energy products. This announcement follows previous struggles with similar initiatives, but executives express confidence in the tangible nature of these upcoming products. The new ADAS system, featuring lidar technology, is expected to debut in the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV in 2028, promising enhanced safety and convenience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Western Alliance, a regional bank, stated that an alleged $98 million loan fraud, which caused a recent market selloff, is an isolated issue within its note finance business. CEO Kenneth Vecchione informed analysts that the bank has set aside $30 million in reserves and has since reverified titles and liens for other large loans, finding no irregularities. Regional banks, including Western Alliance and Zions, have seen a reprieve this week after reporting stable earnings and improved credit quality. Despite the bank's reassurances, analysts remain cautious, suggesting that investor concerns about isolated losses could cap future share gains for the regional banking sector.

          <p>Thames Valley Police announced that no charges will be brought against four men arrested for projecting images of Donald Trump and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The incident occurred in September during Trump's state visit to the UK, leading to arrests on suspicion of malicious communications and public nuisance. After an investigation, authorities concluded that no further action would be taken. Trump and Epstein were acquaintances in the 1990s and early 2000s, though Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with the deceased financier. The event highlighted public protests surrounding the visit.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Sophia James engineered a viral TikTok trend called "Group 7" as a "science experiment" to manipulate the platform's algorithm and promote her new single, "So Unfair." By posting a series of seven videos, she engaged millions of users who wanted to be part of the exclusive "Group 7." Celebrities and brands quickly adopted the trend, amplifying its reach. Experts like Karen North from USC explain that James's success stemmed from understanding TikTok's engagement-based algorithm and turning her promotion into an interactive game. This article showcases a clever strategy for leveraging social media for artistic promotion and audience participation.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's shares fell despite reporting robust third-quarter earnings, strong organic revenue growth, and a 15% expansion in its backlog to over $135 billion. The company exceeded revenue and EPS estimates and announced the acquisition of the remaining 50% of its Prolec GE joint venture for $5.275 billion, expected to enhance growth and profitability. Despite these positive indicators, the stock was caught in a broader sell-off of speculative energy assets. Jim Cramer advises investors to view this pullback as a buying opportunity, reiterating a "One" rating and a $700 price target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating a return to revenue growth after two consecutive declines, though fourth-quarter projections show a potential drop. The article highlights concerns from CEO Elon Musk regarding higher tariff costs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits impacting sales. Despite record deliveries of 497,099 vehicles in Q3, year-to-date deliveries are down. Analysts will closely monitor Musk's commentary on Robotaxi pilots, new lower-cost Model 3/Y production, and the adoption of premium driver assistance systems. Tesla's brand ranking has also declined amidst increased competition and Musk's political rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Study Reveals Wide Range of Physiological Side Effects Among Antidepressants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 13:42:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in The Lancet, analyzing over 58,000 participants, found that different antidepressants can cause a wide range of "clinically significant" physiological side effects. These include variations in weight change, heart rate, blood pressure, and total cholesterol, depending on the specific medication. For example, some drugs were linked to weight gain in nearly half of users, while others were associated with weight loss. The article emphasizes that these findings should not deter antidepressant use, which remains effective, but rather underscore the importance of tailoring treatments to individual patient health and preferences, with careful monitoring of potential side effects.</p>

          <p>The NFL has approved the sale of a 10% minority stake in the New York Giants to Julia Koch, valuing the team at a record $10.3 billion. This transaction sets a new benchmark for NFL team valuations. Additionally, Dean Metropoulos and Sixth Street Partners acquired an 8% stake in the New England Patriots for $9 billion, and Pete Briger Jr. bought a 3.2% stake in the San Francisco 49ers for $8.6 billion. These escalating valuations are attributed to expectations of significantly higher media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investors, boosting liquidity and setting a floor on team values within the league.</p>

          <p>A south-west London council has reversed a £150 fine issued to Burcu Yesilyurt for pouring coffee remnants down a street gully. Yesilyurt believed she was acting responsibly by avoiding spillage on a bus, but was fined under the Environmental Protection Act. The council, after reviewing body-worn footage, cancelled the fine, acknowledging it was a "minor contravention" and her appeal would likely succeed. Yesilyurt, who was "shocked" by the lack of public awareness regarding the law, called for clearer signage. The incident sparked a "huge" public reaction, highlighting the need for better communication about environmental regulations.</p>
