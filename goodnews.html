          <p>Wigan Warriors secured their first-ever Women's Challenge Cup title by defeating St Helens in a dominant performance. The Warriors scored seven tries, ending St Helens' four-year reign in the competition. Megan Williams and Mary Coleman set the tone early, followed by tries from Emily Veivers, Isabel Rowe, Eva Hunter, Grace Banks, and Anna Davies. This victory marks a significant milestone for Wigan and a first piece of silverware for coach Denis Betts, who had previously won seven Challenge Cups as a player. The game saw Wigan dominate their rivals, achieving a derby win on the grandest stage of Wembley finals, with St Helens only getting on the board through Katie Mottershead. The score reflects Wigan's utter dominance and is not an optimism score.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the significant strides made in cancer treatment, noting a substantial decline in age-adjusted cancer death rates in the US since 1991. The author uses the personal story of Jon Gluck, a multiple myeloma survivor, to illustrate how advancements in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence into a manageable condition. Contributing factors include reduced smoking rates, improved screening methods, and breakthroughs in immunotherapy. While challenges remain, particularly with rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people, the overall trend indicates a positive shift in the battle against cancer.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was apprehended after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, was captured 1.5 miles northwest of the Calico Rock prison following a nearly two-week manhunt. He briefly attempted to flee from officers but was quickly apprehended. Investigators are eager to question Hardin about his escape, which involved impersonating a corrections officer. His capture brings relief to the community, especially to the family of James Appleton, whom Hardin murdered.</p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming Spending Review is expected to reveal a significant increase in overall government spending, surpassing ¬£650 billion by 2029-30, which is roughly ¬£100 billion more than when Labour took office. The government is keen to highlight this increase compared to the Conservative years. However, the distribution of these funds remains a point of contention, with some departments, such as the NHS, receiving substantial allocations while others, like the Home Office, are struggling. The review will emphasize long-term projects, but short-term spending money will be tight, and the government faces pressure to present a convincing narrative to improve its public image.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, using Delaware's program as a case study. While time limits are intended to encourage self-sufficiency and increase turnover in the system, there's little evidence they consistently boost employment or help people move off subsidies. Delaware's program includes work requirements, financial support, and savings incentives. However, the success of time limits depends on the availability of affordable housing and additional support services. Other regions, like Tacoma, Washington, have abandoned time limits due to their ineffectiveness.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on Ncuti Gatwa's brief but impactful tenure as the Fifteenth Doctor on *Doctor Who*. Gatwa's casting as the first Black, openly queer, and African-born Doctor represented a significant departure for the series. His Doctor was more emotionally available and embraced a diverse range of fashion styles, bringing a new level of queerness to the franchise. Gatwa's performance allowed the series to explore themes of racism and privilege in ways that previous Doctors could not, marking a significant contribution to the show's legacy.</p>
