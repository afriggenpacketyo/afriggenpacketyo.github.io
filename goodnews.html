        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia at the G7 summit, aiming to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin and restrict Vladimir Putin's war efforts in Ukraine. The sanctions, designed to squeeze Russia's energy revenues and reduce funds for the illegal war, are expected to be unveiled alongside other Ukraine allies. However, it appeared unlikely that the US would join the move after Donald Trump signalled his opposition to further measures during the G7 summit in Canada, saying the sanctions "cost [the US] a lot of money". Starmer emphasized that Russia doesn't hold all the cards, indicating a strong stance against Russian aggression. </p>

The amendment maintains punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of the existing law, while Creasy's amendment differs.

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on global arms exports. This shift aims to deepen ties and enhance interoperability with allies and partners. By exporting arms, Japan can improve interoperability through standardized maintenance and joint training. This move also supports the development of Japan's defense industrial base, which has been struggling. Veteran investor David Roche suggests that building domestic capacity is crucial for Japan's security, especially given potential changes in U.S. defense policy. </p>
