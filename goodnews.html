          <p>Mohamed Salah's quest to break the Premier League's goal involvement record continues after a mixed performance. Despite approaching his 400th appearance for Liverpool, Salah missed a significant opportunity in a recent match against Brighton. While he showed promise earlier in the season, his form has dipped, scoring only one goal and providing one assist in the last eight matches. Despite this, Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, remains confident in Salah's ability to bounce back and secure the record, emphasizing his typically inhuman performance levels.

          <p>Researchers are deploying specially trained dogs to locate and eradicate spotted lanternfly egg masses in the United States. These invasive pests, harmless to humans but damaging to trees and fruit crops, have spread across the East coast and into the Midwest. The dogs, working in the Cleveland area, have already uncovered thousands of egg masses, potentially eliminating hundreds of thousands of lanternflies. The program, facilitated by a grant from the US Department of Agriculture, involves training dogs to identify the scent of the egg masses, helping to slow the spread of these destructive insects.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements received by Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, alleging that some celebrities were illegally paid for their support. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Bruce Springsteen, and Beyonce publicly denied receiving payment for their endorsements, stating that payments from the Harris campaign were for production costs associated with campaign events. Campaign law experts have stated that there are no Federal Election Commission regulations against campaigns paying celebrities for endorsements, as long as those payments are properly disclosed.</p>

          <p>Following the collision of a Mexican navy ship with the Brooklyn Bridge, officials have confirmed that the bridge's load-bearing elements sustained no significant structural damage. The NTSB is investigating the incident, which resulted in two fatalities, focusing on factors such as the crew's operation, the vessel's condition, and nautical elements like weather and tide. Preliminary data suggests the ship was attempting to sail south down the East River when it struck the bridge.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The judge ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, stating that the officials who replaced him were "illegitimately installed." The court found that the administration's actions to dismantle USIP, including terminating board members and dispersing its assets, were unconstitutional. The judge also noted that Trump used force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP headquarters, despite the agency not being part of the government's executive branch.</p>

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need to move on from "political fights" about Brexit and find practical solutions. The agreement aims to reduce paperwork and checks for food and drink imports and exports, while the UK government has unveiled a ¬£360m investment fund in coastal communities and the fishing industry.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump says a new revenge porn law will protect children online. The Take It Down Act criminalises posting "intimate images" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. Advocates for digital rights and free speech say it could lead to the censorship of legitimate content, including legal pornography, LGBT content, and government criticism.</p>
