          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced discussions to hire Sean Dyche as their new manager following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Dyche has emerged as the leading candidate after Postecoglou was sacked just minutes after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, which left the team in the relegation zone. While other names like Roberto Mancini and Marco Silva were considered, complications such as existing contracts and release clauses have positioned Dyche as the primary contender. The club is hopeful of finalizing the appointment soon to bring stability to the team after a turbulent season.</p>

          <p>A collection of newly discovered short stories by "To Kill a Mockingbird" author Harper Lee is set to be published, offering a window into her evolution as a writer. Found in her New York apartment after her death, these "apprentice stories" were written before her iconic novel and feature early versions of familiar characters and settings. Lee's family describes the works as showing "a brilliant writer in the making," revealing her craft and early explorations of themes that would later define her masterpiece, which famously centered on a Black man falsely accused of rape.</p>

          <p>Early sales data indicates that Apple's new iPhone 17 is outperforming its predecessor, with a 14% increase in sales in the key markets of the United States and China. According to Counterpoint Research, the standard iPhone 17 model is experiencing particularly high demand, attributed to significant upgrades including an improved display, more storage, and the new A19 chip. In China, sales for the base model have nearly doubled compared to the iPhone 16's initial launch period. The high-end iPhone 17 Pro Max is also seeing robust demand, especially within the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the first rugby league Ashes Test since 2003, dual-code legend Jonathan Davies reflects on Great Britain's memorable 1994 victory over Australia at Wembley. Davies, who scored a classic 50-metre try in that game, offers advice to the current England side, emphasizing patience, a strong kicking game, and seizing opportunities. The 1994 match is remembered for the home side playing with 12 men for nearly an hour yet still defeating the world champions. The article draws parallels between then and now, as the Kangaroos arrive as favorites for the series opener in London.</p>

          <p>Poland is being recognized as a significant economic success story within the European Union, consistently outperforming larger economies like Germany and France with strong GDP growth. Analysts attribute its success to effective integration into the EU, substantial funding for infrastructure, a welcoming business environment, and a robust domestic market driven by strong consumer spending. Despite this positive trajectory, potential challenges remain, including internal political divisions and the need for fiscal consolidation to manage a growing government deficit. The country's economic dynamism and strategic importance are increasingly drawing attention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Centrist candidate Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential runoff election, defeating right-wing rival Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga and ending 20 years of governance by the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Preliminary results show Paz securing 54% of the vote, capitalizing on voter frustration with the country's severe economic crisis. Paz plans to implement significant economic reforms, including ending the fixed exchange rate and phasing out fuel subsidies, but has promised a gradual approach to avoid sharp inflation. His victory, aided by his popular anti-corruption running mate Edman Lara, signals a period of major political and economic change for the nation.</p>

          <p>A couple in Pembrokeshire, Wales, who built a £150,000 eco-home must demonstrate they are living a genuinely green lifestyle or face having their house demolished. Their home was constructed under Wales' unique One Planet Development policy, which allows building on land not typically granted planning permission if residents can prove they are self-sufficient. Abigail and Marcus Beck will be monitored for five years and must meet strict requirements, such as producing their own energy and water and growing a significant portion of their food. The policy scrutinizes every aspect of their lives to ensure they maintain a low-carbon, sustainable existence.</p>

          <p>Using a groundbreaking camera with nanometer resolution and millisecond imaging speed, Chinese scientists have successfully captured the "kiss-shrink-run" process of communication between neurons. This achievement, published in the journal Science, provides a visual record of how synaptic vesicles transmit signals in the brain, a process that was previously too fast and small to observe directly. The findings have also helped resolve a long-standing scientific debate in neuroscience that has persisted for half a century. The research was led by teams from the University of Science and Technology of China and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that updated medical guidance recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies in children. The research, published in Pediatrics, analyzed health records and found a significant decline in allergy diagnoses after guidelines changed in 2015 and 2017. Previously, parents were advised to delay introducing allergens, but a landmark trial proved that early exposure dramatically reduces the risk of developing the life-threatening allergy. The findings offer strong real-world evidence that the public health effort is making a measurable impact on a growing health issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have discovered that the exceptional longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats are associated with a specific version of a protein involved in DNA repair, which is also present in humans. These rodents have a maximum lifespan of around 37 years, which is extraordinary for an animal of their size. Published in the journal Science, the findings suggest that this unique protein activation could provide a molecular basis for their long, healthy lives. This breakthrough could inspire new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving health and extending lifespan in humans by targeting similar anti-aging mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The British military will be granted new powers to shoot down drones that pose a threat to its bases in the United Kingdom. The new "kinetic option," to be announced by the Defence Secretary, is designed to enable faster and more decisive action against potential threats. This move follows a series of mysterious drone sightings over four British airbases used by U.S. forces last year and other disruptions across Europe. While the new authority will initially apply only to military sites, it could potentially be extended to civilian locations like airports in the future.</p>

Once over 100 points behind, Verstappen's recent string of wins has cut his deficit to McLaren's Oscar Piastri to just 40 points with five races remaining. For the first time this season, Verstappen acknowledged that winning a fifth consecutive title is a real possibility, citing improvements to his Red Bull car.
