          <h2>Chief Justice Roberts Defends Judicial Independence Amid Trump's Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts publicly defended the importance of an independent judiciary, emphasizing its role in checking the excesses of Congress or the executive branch. His remarks come amid criticism from President Trump and his allies, who have accused judges of overstepping their bounds, especially concerning rulings against the President's agenda. Roberts also reiterated his previous stance against calls for impeachment of judges due to disagreements with their decisions, asserting that impeachment is not the appropriate response and the normal appellate review process should be followed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should be aware of potential minimum draw requirements that could impact the cost-effectiveness of this borrowing option. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, or both, potentially leading to unnecessary interest charges. These rules can complicate repayment strategies, especially with variable-rate HELOCs, and borrowers should carefully review the fine print to ensure the terms align with their borrowing needs. Alternatives like home equity loans or waiting until ready to draw more funds may be worth considering.</p>

          <h2>Trump Unveils UK Trade Deal After Tariff Pause</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 14:27:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump unveiled the framework of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, the first since pausing "reciprocal" tariffs. The deal maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusts tariffs on UK autos, and aims to increase US exports. The White House says the deal creates a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for US farmers, ranchers, and producers. Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined remotely and called it an "incredible platform for the future," while some experts downplayed its impact.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged following President Trump's announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, driven by optimism about reduced trade barriers. Boeing shares rose due to the UK's agreement to buy airplane parts, confirming a thesis that its planes could reduce trade deficits. Goldman Sachs also saw strong gains, with investors betting that more trade deals are on the way, potentially boosting dealmaking activity. Goldman's president noted strong demand for capital markets transactions with a more certain economic backdrop.</p>

          <p>Amazon is now allowing pet owners to order prescriptions online for their dogs and cats through a partnership with Vetsource. The addition includes hundreds of commonly prescribed pet medications, ranging from flea and tick solutions to treatments for chronic conditions. Prescriptions are purchased via Amazon's storefront and require veterinarian approval, with Vetsource overseeing dispensing and delivery. This move puts Amazon into direct competition with Chewy and Walmart in the online pet pharmacy market.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US, but the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US has been scrapped. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, potentially easing the burden of his sweeping tariffs. The deal keeps the 10% tariff on U.K. imports but lowers tariffs on British autos. In exchange, the U.K. will ease trade barriers on U.S. agricultural products, like beef and ethanol, and fast-track U.S. imports through U.K. customs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the framework will boost trade, protect jobs, and open market access, but also acknowledged the need for further negotiations.</p>
