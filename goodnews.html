          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans from US dollars to Chinese yuan, a move anticipated to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. This decision, announced by Kenyan Treasury Minister John Mbadi, is seen by analysts as a potential precedent for other debt-stressed African nations, possibly drawing them closer to China. The loans, initially from the Export-Import Bank of China, financed the Standard Gauge Railway. While the new yuan loan terms, including interest rates, were not fully disclosed, Mbadi previously indicated a halving of rates from the existing 6.37% under the dollar agreement.

          <p>Redshirt freshman walk-on King Miller delivered a breakout performance, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown, powering USC to a decisive 31-13 win over No. 15 Michigan. Stepping in after injuries to USC's top two running backs, Miller's game-changing runs in the third quarter broke open the contest. This victory marks a significant rebound for the Trojans after a previous loss to Illinois and improves Coach Lincoln Riley's record against ranked teams. The defense also played a crucial role, stifling Michigan's offense and holding their standout freshman quarterback to just 207 passing yards and their rushing attack to 3.5 yards per carry, demonstrating a comprehensive team effort.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers secured their first postseason series win since 2018 by defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 in the decisive fifth game of their NL Division Series. Andrew Vaughn, William Contreras, and Brice Turang all hit tie-breaking or insurance home runs for Milwaukee. The Brewers employed an all-hands-on-deck pitching strategy, with five pitchers combining for a four-hitter. This victory sets up an NLCS showdown against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who previously swept the Phillies. The win was particularly sweet for Brewers fans, as it came against their arch-rivals and former manager Craig Counsell, who now leads the Cubs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are meticulously preparing for their NL Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, who defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their Division Series. The article outlines nine key concerns for the Dodgers, highlighting the Brewers' unique small-ball offensive approach, which emphasizes getting on base and making contact rather than relying on home runs. Milwaukee's pitching staff, known for developing talent, is also a major strength, ranking second in team ERA this season. The Dodgers, who were swept by the Brewers in July, face a formidable opponent with deep offensive and pitching rosters, making for a challenging series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shohei Ohtani's performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies has drawn criticism, prompting manager Dave Roberts to call for a "recalibration." Ohtani struggled, going one for 18 with nine strikeouts, primarily against left-handed pitching. While Ohtani acknowledged the Phillies' strong pitching, Roberts emphasized the need for Ohtani to improve his "at-bat quality," specifically regarding aggression outside the strike zone and passivity within it. The manager stressed that the team cannot win the World Series with such a performance, highlighting Ohtani's crucial role and the implications for the upcoming NL Championship Series.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and the return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, which has occurred for over a century, grants most people an extra hour. The change will happen at 02:00 BST on Sunday, October 26, 2025. While the nights are already drawing in, this change will abruptly bring sunset forward by an hour. Debates persist about making BST permanent, with arguments for economic boosts and reduced road accidents, but concerns remain about dark winter mornings, especially in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Maggie Kang, co-creator and co-director of the animated film 'Kpop Demon Hunters,' expressed excitement for potential sequels following the movie's unprecedented success. The film, which features a Kpop girl trio battling demon boy bands, has become Netflix's most-watched title, surpassing 'Squid Game' with over 325 million views. Its soundtrack also made history with four songs simultaneously in the US top 10, including the chart-topping anthem 'Golden.'
