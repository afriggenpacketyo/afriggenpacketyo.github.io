          <h2>Modern Lifestyles and Systemic Barriers Undermine Sleep Quality Despite Technological Advances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite modern comforts like climate control and comfortable beds creating ideal sleep conditions, many Americans still suffer from poor sleep. Factors contributing to this paradox include modern lifestyle choices like "revenge bedtime procrastination" and late-night screen use, as well as systemic issues. Environmental factors such as noise pollution, housing insecurity, and stress from discrimination disproportionately affect marginalized communities, creating significant sleep health disparities. The article suggests that while individual habits matter, addressing these broader societal and environmental barriers is crucial for improving national sleep quality.</p>

          <p>China and Serbia are set to hold their first joint military training exercise, marking a significant step in their deepening defense relationship. The drill is intended to enhance the combat skills of the participating forces and foster greater cooperation between the two militaries. This event represents China's first military exercise with a European nation since its joint training with Belarus last year. The partnership is notable as Serbia, a candidate for European Union membership, maintains close ties with Beijing and has no plans to join the NATO alliance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation rate dropped to 2.1% in June, a figure lower than anticipated and marking a continuation of its decline to a more than six-year low. This trend, largely driven by a decrease in food prices, provides the Reserve Bank of India with greater flexibility to consider further interest rate cuts to stimulate economic growth. However, officials remain cautious about potential risks, including weather uncertainties and the impact of global trade tensions. India is currently in negotiations with the U.S. to secure a trade deal and avoid potential new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has initiated a public consultation to explore turning the state-owned Post Office into a mutually-run, employee-owned business. This move is part of a broader effort to reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will examine how the Post Office can adapt to changing consumer needs, particularly in providing banking services as high street banks close. Proponents argue that a mutual model could prevent future scandals by giving staff a greater stake and role in decision-making.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $120,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional adoption. The rally is also fueled by anticipation of clearer U.S. regulations, as Congress begins deliberations on a series of crypto-focused bills during what has been termed 'Crypto Week'. Analysts believe that sustained interest from long-term institutional buyers could propel the cryptocurrency's value even higher in the coming months. The new legislation aims to provide a stable framework for digital assets, including potential federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, former Olympic diver and author Cassidy Krug discusses the challenges of navigating major life changes, a topic she explores in her new book, "Resurface." Krug shares insights from her own transition out of professional sports and from interviews with others who have faced significant shifts, like leaving prison. She emphasizes that transitions are inevitable, often involve a loss of community, and require redefining success. To overcome the paralysis of uncertainty, she recommends reframing fear as an opportunity and taking small, concrete steps to explore new interests rather than waiting for a new passion to appear.</p>
