Blake Snell is making progress in his throwing progression, and Shohei Ohtani remains on track to return after the All-Star break.

The other eaglet, Gizmo, remains in the nest, with her readiness for flight in the next few days uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pausing its plan to garnish people's Social Security benefits if they have defaulted on their student loans. The administration stated its commitment to protecting Social Security recipients who often rely on a fixed income. This decision is a reversal of a previous announcement to resume collection activity on the country's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause provides older student borrowers more time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. (not investment advice)</p>
