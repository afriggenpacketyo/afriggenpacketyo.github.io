          <p>European officials are scrutinizing the recently announced trade agreement between the United States and Britain to understand how the Trump administration might influence them to adopt stricter policies concerning China. The agreement, while not explicitly naming China, contains language on supply chain security, forced labor, and data security, which is interpreted as targeting Beijing's economic influence. Observers believe this deal could set a precedent for future trade negotiations, pushing countries to align with the U.S. on measures to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains, particularly in sectors like steel and pharmaceuticals.</p>

Mazzone's traditional approach contrasts with the modern emphasis on spin rates and pitch counts, which he believes has made baseball less exciting for fans.</p>
