          <p>The European Union is reportedly drafting "precise plans" to potentially send troops to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees, according to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. These plans, agreed upon during a meeting involving US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would include support from the United States, including intelligence and surveillance assets. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Germany is bracing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, indicating a lack of optimism for a swift resolution in 2025. This multinational troop deployment is intended to provide security for Ukraine after the war with Russia concludes. The article highlights the EU's proactive measures to ensure stability in the region. </p>

          <p>Dak Prescott addressed the trade of Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating he was not surprised due to the nature of the negotiations between Parsons and the Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones. Prescott expressed relief that a resolution was reached, as the situation had become a potential distraction for the team. The Cowboys received the Packers' next two first-round picks and All-Pro defensive tackle Kenny Clark in exchange for Parsons. Prescott communicated well wishes to Parsons after the trade, acknowledging that they will face each other in Week 4. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance on Monday as investors analyzed China's RatingDog manufacturing data for August, which indicated expansion at 50.5. This contrasted with the official manufacturing PMI, which showed a contraction for the fifth consecutive month at 49.4. Investors also monitored developments in India-China relations, with leaders agreeing to be development partners rather than rivals. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi experienced declines. </p>

          <p>A private survey indicated that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, driven by increased new orders and a recovery in export business. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index reached 50.5, exceeding economists' estimates. This signals the fastest expansion rate since March, rebounding from July's contraction. However, China's official manufacturing PMI showed a fifth consecutive month of contraction, coming in at 49.4. </p>

          <p>A report suggests that Australia's planned social media ban for individuals under 16 could be implemented using various technologies, but each method presents risks and limitations. The government's ban, set to take effect in December, aims to mitigate the harmful effects of social media. Under the new laws, platforms must take "reasonable steps" to prevent Australian children from creating accounts and deactivate existing ones. The report recommends a layered approach to age verification, highlighting that there is no single, universally effective solution. </p>
