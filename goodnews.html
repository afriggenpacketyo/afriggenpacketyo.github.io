          <p>The United States and China have mutually agreed to extend a pause on significant tariffs for another 90 days, temporarily averting a potential escalation in their trade conflict. President Trump confirmed the extension via an executive order, maintaining the truce that has kept massive duties on hold. China’s Commerce Ministry announced a reciprocal suspension of its additional tariffs on U.S. goods. This move continues the de-escalation that began in May, which prevented a major economic disruption by halting tariffs that had reached as high as 145% on some products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unconventional agreement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The deal, confirmed by the White House, allows the companies to sell specific advanced chips, like Nvidia's H20, to the Chinese market after previous restrictions were imposed due to national security concerns. President Trump described negotiating the deal directly with Nvidia's CEO, framing it as a beneficial arrangement for the country. This revenue-sharing plan represents a novel approach to export controls and technology competition with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to track the critically endangered axolotl in the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City. This method involves filtering water to find genetic traces of the elusive salamander, as traditional net surveys increasingly come up empty. Once abundant, the axolotl population has plummeted from 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014 due to pollution and habitat loss. While eDNA has been found in protected refuge areas, scientists emphasize that large-scale habitat restoration is crucial for the species' survival.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Characterizes Trump's 15% Cut from Chip Sales to China as a Form of Tariff</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has commented on the recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of their China-bound AI chip revenue, arguing it is not a novel policy. He equated the arrangement to another form of tariff, similar to other trade policies enacted by the Trump administration. While acknowledging a "pay-to-play" element, Cramer suggested the deal is a relatively benign form of government intervention in business. He concluded that allowing the chip sales to proceed is more significant than the revenue-sharing mandate, ultimately benefiting both the taxpayers and the companies involved.

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu lost a hard-fought, three-hour match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open. The final score was 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 in favor of the defending champion. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is seen as another strong sign of her resurgence, demonstrating she can compete at the highest level as she continues her comeback from past fitness issues. Her improved resilience and strong play suggest a positive outlook as she heads into the upcoming US Open, where she could be a seeded player.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix, continuing their relationship with the streaming giant. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, giving Netflix first right of refusal on projects rather than exclusive development rights. The partnership has previously produced successful documentary series like "Harry & Meghan" and is expanding to include Meghan's lifestyle brand, "As ever." Upcoming projects include a second season of her cooking show and a film adaptation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the South Park neighborhood of downtown L.A. The project, proposed by a New York developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not commented on a construction start date, reflecting a challenging financial climate for new development. High interest rates, tariffs on materials, and rising labor costs are creating uncertainty for builders, despite high demand for housing in the city.</p>

          <p>Sinclair, one of the largest TV station owners in the U.S., has announced it is conducting a strategic review of its broadcast business that could lead to a merger.

This move comes as the media industry anticipates potential deregulation under the Trump administration, which could facilitate more consolidation among broadcast companies. Sinclair's stock rose on the news, though the company noted there is no assurance a deal will be finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

Team captain Phil Salt compared his performance to that of England legend James Anderson, who was rested for the game. Baker's spell, which earned him player of the match, highlighted why the young talent is so highly rated in English cricket.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, effectively overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have imposed duties on certain gold bars from Switzerland. The customs ruling had caused the precious metal to hit a record high, as it would have applied a 39% tariff on 1-kilogram and 100-ounce bars used to back COMEX futures contracts. Following the president's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures fell sharply. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had previously warned that the tariffs could negatively impact the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>
