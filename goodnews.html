          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada Garcia, a co-founder of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, has pleaded guilty to a range of federal charges in the U.S., including drug trafficking, gun offenses, and money laundering. During his court appearance, Zambada expressed profound remorse for the extensive harm that illegal drugs have inflicted upon the populations of both the United States and Mexico. The 77-year-old cartel leader, who was arrested in July 2024, is now expected to face a life sentence, with his sentencing scheduled for January. This significant plea represents a major victory for U.S. law enforcement in its ongoing efforts to dismantle powerful transnational criminal organizations and bring their leaders to justice.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett confirmed to CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, but he met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss increased cooperation for more efficient freight rail. This follows a new partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX for coast-to-coast services. The news caused CSX shares to drop about 5%, as previous speculation had fueled a surge in railroad stocks. Buffett aims for collaboration to achieve benefits similar to a merger without the acquisition cost, focusing on mutual operational benefits for both companies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back EV incentives and a recent slowdown in U.S. sales, Ford is investing $5 billion in a new EV platform to produce a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000 by 2027. This ambitious move challenges the current trend of expensive EVs and indicates automakers believe in the long-term growth of the electric vehicle market, especially globally. The article suggests that a lower price point, rather than environmental regulations, will ultimately drive widespread EV adoption, showcasing a strategic shift to capture a broader market.

          <p>The Oval Invincibles have effectively clinched their place in Sunday's men's Hundred final after a convincing six-wicket victory against London Spirit at The Oval. The two-time defending champions are now four points clear at the top of the table, making it highly improbable for them to be overtaken due to their superior net run-rate advantage. Key performances included Jordan Cox's 47 runs from 27 balls and Donovan Ferreira's rapid 24 runs from just nine balls, showcasing the team's strong batting lineup. They now await their opponent in the eliminator round, appearing well-positioned for a third successive title.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved significant box office success with a two-day theatrical sing-along release, generating an estimated $16 million to $20 million domestically. Despite this, industry experts believe it's an "eventizing" one-off and unlikely to change Netflix's core strategy of prioritizing streaming over extended theatrical runs. The company uses these releases as marketing tools for its platform, often negotiating unique terms with theaters, though it did not partner with AMC for this film. The film's success highlights the value of theatrical events for generating publicity and cultural buzz. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the share of union-represented workers in California has remained stable at 16-18% over the last two decades, contrasting sharply with a nationwide decline in union membership. This stability is attributed to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry at large hospitals and at companies like Starbucks, with significant gains for the Service Employees International Union. While some sectors like grocery and film production saw declines due to automation and production slowdowns, California's proactive union activity has largely helped maintain its membership density, showcasing a resilient labor movement in the state.</p>
