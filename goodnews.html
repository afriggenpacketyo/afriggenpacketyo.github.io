          <p>Startup founders share their experiences bouncing back from business failures, highlighting the immense pressure and emotional toll involved. Serial entrepreneur Ismael Dainehine and others discuss the challenges of admitting failure, disappointing investors, and laying off employees, which can lead to an identity crisis for those deeply invested in their ventures. A Rutgers Business School study even found an "entrepreneurship penalty," where recruiters are less likely to hire former business owners. However, many find that the diverse skills gained from running a business, like multitasking and time management, make founders excellent employees. Redefining success and focusing on a deep sense of purpose are crucial for resilience and moving forward after setbacks.</p>

          <p>China is actively relaxing its visa-free entry rules to significantly boost its tourism sector and attract more foreign visitors. Passport holders from 55 nations, including Australia, Russia, Indonesia, the United States, and several European countries, can now enjoy stays of up to 10 days when transiting through international airports. Furthermore, an expanding list of foreign nationals is permitted to remain for up to 30 days without needing a visa. This initiative, exemplified by the recent announcement allowing Russian citizens a 30-day visa-free stay, aims to streamline entry processes and signals a deliberate effort to enhance international engagement and economic activity.</p>

          <p>Ionic Rare Earths, an Irish company, is pioneering a method to extract valuable rare earth oxides from recycled industrial magnets, crucial for cleaner energy and military technology. This innovation aims to reduce Western reliance on China, which currently controls 60% of global supply and 90% of processing. Managing director Tim Harrison emphasizes their unique position as the only non-Chinese company doing this separation, offering a rapid solution to an immediate problem. The company plans to extract nearly 441 tons of oxides annually, potentially supplying 200,000 electric vehicle motors and securing a stable supply chain, with commercial production targeted for 2027.</p>

He also discusses his decision to move to America late in his playing career, which helped him transition into management by offering a different perspective on the game. Away from the pitch, Iraola emphasizes the importance of his family, who sacrifice much to support his career, and finds escape in reading and cycling.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada is more than a championship match; it's a critical moment for the future of women's Test rugby. England, the top-ranked team, benefits from substantial funding, including 32 full-time professional contracts and the world's best domestic league, leading to a dominant win record. In stark contrast, Canada, ranked second, operates on a fraction of England's budget, with players earning significantly less and relying on crowdfunding for World Cup preparation. This disparity raises questions about whether Canada's success could encourage other cash-strapped unions to pursue more nimble, targeted preparation, potentially undermining the argument for full-time professionalism across the sport.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, is pushing for an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the European Union to improve the public finances ahead of the autumn Budget. She argues that an exchange scheme for young workers would significantly benefit the economy, foster growth, and support businesses. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to stay for two years without a right to remain, similar to existing agreements with other countries. Reeves also urged the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic impact of this scheme into its forecasts, hoping to reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her highly anticipated film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to capture the "primal" and "sexual" feelings she experienced reading it as a teenager. Fennell, known for her provocative films like "Saltburn," revealed her gothic and stylized approach, evident in the erotically charged trailer featuring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. She describes Brontë's 1847 novel as "difficult, complicated, and devastatingly sexy," acknowledging her own "extreme masochism" in adapting such personal and beloved material. Despite taking liberties, Fennell stressed her determination to preserve Brontë's original dialogue, calling it "the best dialogue ever."</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy for Huntington's disease has shown remarkable success in slowing the progression of the illness by 75%, offering "unbelievable hope" for patients and their families. Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt was diagnosed in 2011, describes the news as "winning the lottery 10 times over," transforming their outlook on growing old together and seeing their children mature. Huntington's, a cruel neurodegenerative disease, previously had no treatment, leading to devastating physical and mental decline. While the therapy is still in early stages and faces hurdles for NHS approval, scientists are optimistic it could also have broader implications for treating other neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's and dementia.</p>
