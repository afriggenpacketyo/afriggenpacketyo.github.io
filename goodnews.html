          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time during Friday's practice session for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Despite leading, Norris expressed concern over the tight competition, stating the field was "a bit close for my liking." The high-speed Monza circuit presents a different challenge compared to last week's race at Zandvoort, with drivers testing the limits of their low-downforce setups. Norris's teammate Oscar Piastri also showed strong pace, finishing fourth despite missing the first practice session.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, driving a significant increase in ticket sales for lottery courier services like Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported that 15 million Powerball tickets have been ordered through its platform during the current jackpot run, with sales increasing 130% in a single day this week. This surge provides a major boost to DraftKings, which acquired Jackpocket in 2024 to cross-sell customers into its sports betting and iGaming offerings. The massive prize highlights the lucrative, if unpredictable, nature of the lottery business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback and reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen has signed a new endorsement deal with New Balance, ending his long-standing partnership with Nike. Allen announced the move in a letter to his hometown of Firebaugh, California, a community that will benefit from the deal through New Balance's commitment to fund its youth sports programs. The signing is a significant win for New Balance, which has been aggressively expanding its roster of high-profile athletes across various sports.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This decline offers potential relief for homebuyers who have been facing high borrowing costs and stubbornly elevated home prices. The drop brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year, potentially saving homeowners hundreds of dollars on monthly payments. However, economists remain uncertain if this decrease will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses are set to face Australia's Wallaroos in a crucial Women's Rugby World Cup match, with England heavily favored to continue their undefeated streak against the Australians. The match holds significance for both teams, as England aims to fine-tune its strategy for the knockout stages while Australia seeks to secure its own spot. A key player for Australia is 18-year-old fullback Caitlyn Halse, the youngest Australian to play in a World Cup, who has been a standout performer. The game also marks a poignant moment for Australia's English coach, Jo Yapp, who will be leaving her role after the tournament.</p>

          <p>A new image captured by the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The photograph reveals that the comet's coma and tail have become significantly more extended, indicating increased activity as it approaches the sun. Scientists are using the opportunity to study the comet's composition through its light spectrum, hoping to learn more about its origins from another star system. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>In an article for The Atlantic, novelist Lauren Grodstein reflects on her visit to Tbilisi, Georgia, where she witnessed mass protests against a pro-Russian government. The experience reshaped her understanding of democratic resistance, particularly the perseverance of citizens protesting despite the high likelihood of failure. Drawing parallels to the current political climate in the United States, Grodstein questions when personal accommodation to government priorities must give way to active opposition. She concludes that the fight for democracy is a long-term, perhaps lifelong, commitment, a lesson she learned from the resilience of the Georgian people.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson is reflecting on her long-standing career in her new memoir, "Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music." Gibson, who at 17 became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard No. 1 hit, credits her late mother, Diane, for her success. She recalls how her mother, who acted as her manager, secured a loan to build a home studio where she demoed her famous songs. Gibson also discusses navigating the music industry's pressures and her decision to eventually record independently, which she says has led to a new era of creative thriving.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 12:38:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot climbs to an estimated $1.8 billion, potential winners face a substantial tax bill that will significantly reduce their take-home prize. The winner can choose between an $826.4 million lump-sum cash option or an annuity paid over 30 years. Regardless of the choice, there is a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding upfront, which amounts to over $198 million on the cash prize. Because the winnings place the recipient in the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a much larger tax payment will be due, potentially reducing the final amount by millions more.

          <p>The city of Norwalk in Los Angeles County has agreed to repeal a controversial local ordinance that banned the construction of homeless shelters and other services for the poor. The decision is part of a settlement to end a lawsuit filed by the state of California, which argued the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. In addition to repealing the law, Norwalk will allocate $250,000 for new affordable housing and submit to increased state monitoring of its housing policies. The settlement marks a victory for state officials cracking down on local governments that attempt to block housing for homeless residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot at a historic $1.8 billion, an analysis shows that a winner's location significantly impacts their net prize after taxes. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not levy state income tax on lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep more of their prize. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. All winners face a mandatory 24% federal withholding, with the total federal tax burden reaching up to 37%. The data highlights the crucial role state tax policy plays in the ultimate value of a massive lottery win. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Determining a "good" monthly retirement income for 2025 depends heavily on individual circumstances like location, lifestyle, and health, rather than a single universal number. Financial experts often suggest aiming for 75% to 85% of pre-retirement income, but the current U.S. median retirement income is closer to $3,900 per month. With inflation and rising costs, many retirees may need to supplement their Social Security benefits. This article explores strategies for creating additional guaranteed income streams, such as annuities, reverse mortgages for homeowners, and optimizing Social Security by delaying claims until age 70.

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, ambitious compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be valued at up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The package involves awarding Musk 423 million shares if the company achieves aggressive milestones, including reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization and mass-producing its robotaxis and humanoid robots. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to void his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. The board argues the new plan is essential to retain Musk and incentivize his focus on Tesla's future growth. (not investment advice)</p>
