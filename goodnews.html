          <p>Michigan‚Äôs attorney general, Dana Nessel, announced on Monday that she was dropping all charges against seven pro-Palestinian demonstrators arrested last May at a University of Michigan encampment. The announcement came just moments before the judge was to decide on a defense motion to disqualify Nessel‚Äôs office over alleged bias. The protesters and their supporters had previously alleged bias in Nessel‚Äôs office, arguing that the university recruited her because she was a political ally. The article notes that the Guardian‚Äôs investigation revealed concrete evidence of conflicts that defense attorneys argued factored into the prosecutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, in his push to convince the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The average gas price is actually over $3.00 a gallon. The article explains that Trump's claim is likely based on the price of RBOB gasoline futures, which does not reflect what drivers pay at the pump. The article also notes that the average pump price may fall below $3 a gallon soon.</p>
