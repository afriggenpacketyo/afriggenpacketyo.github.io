          <p>Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley have been released from prison after receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump. The couple had been serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud, with Todd receiving a 12-year sentence and Julie a 7-year sentence. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, played a key role in appealing to the Trump administration for the pardons. The Chrisleys were also ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution for their fraudulent activities, which involved providing false information to banks and fabricating financial documents. The family's story will continue with a new reality series on Lifetime, marking a new chapter after their imprisonment.</p>

          <h2>Planning Regulations Eased to Facilitate Heat Pump Installations in UK Homes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 19:11:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, seeks to lower household bills and reduce planet-warming emissions by making heat pump installations easier, particularly for terraced homes. Consumer groups, however, caution that the upfront costs and potential need for upgrades to older housing stock remain significant barriers, especially for renters and leaseholders. The government aims to provide 300,000 households with energy efficiency upgrades through the Warm Homes Plan, but electricity costs need to be addressed to make heat pumps more economically viable.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to invest over ¬£1 billion in battlefield technology and establish a new Cyber Command as part of its strategic defense review. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) aims to enhance decision-making speed on the battlefield by developing a Digital Targeting Web that connects soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that the technology will leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and software, drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine. The UK's military cyber operations will be overseen by the new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command, reflecting the changing nature of warfare.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported strong fiscal first-quarter results, exceeding revenue expectations and providing optimistic guidance for the future. The company's revenue grew 7.6% year over year, driven by its plan to acquire data management company Informatica for $8 billion. Salesforce introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents and achieved significant savings through internal use of its Agentforce agent, leading to the reassignment of 500 customer support workers. Management expects continued growth in adjusted earnings per share and revenue for the upcoming quarter and has raised its full-year forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% revenue jump to $44.1 billion, despite U.S. government restrictions on AI chip sales to China. The company's net income rose 26% to $18.78 billion, exceeding Wall Street's sales expectations. Nvidia projects continued growth, driven by its newest AI chip, Blackwell, with revenue expected to rise 50% in the current quarter.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge, Richard Leon, struck down one of President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive orders, which targeted law firms he disliked. In his 73-page opinion, Leon used numerous exclamation points, a punctuation style frequently used by Trump, to emphasize his points. He described the Trump administration‚Äôs arguments as ‚Äúabsurd!‚Äù and memorably wrote: ‚ÄúThe Order shouts through a bullhorn: If you take on causes disfavored by President Trump, you will be punished!‚Äù The judge ruled in favor of the law firm WilmerHale, finding Trump's attacks on law firms unconstitutional.</p>
