          <p>Philadelphia Phillies player Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming just the 21st player in MLB history to do so. The performance set a new franchise record with nine RBIs and propelled him to the top of the National League's home run leaderboard with 49 for the season. Schwarber's historic night was pivotal in the Phillies' dominant 19-4 victory. He joins Mike Schmidt as the only other Phillies player to accomplish this feat, which last occurred in 1976, marking a memorable moment for the team and its fans.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it is temporarily modifying its AI chatbot policies for teenage users as it faces a Senate investigation into potentially inappropriate conversations. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses related to sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent romantic discussions, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move follows a report that internal documents permitted "sensual" conversations with minors, which Meta has since called erroneous. Advocacy group Common Sense Media recently issued a risk assessment advising against teen use of the AI until fundamental safety failures are addressed by the company.</p>

          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the June home invasion and robbery at the residence of rapper Macklemore. During the incident, two men entered the home through an unlocked door and used bear spray on the nanny while the rapper's three children were present. The investigation, a collaboration between multiple law enforcement agencies, led to the discovery of stolen items, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders ring, at a local jewelry store. The suspect was initially arrested for a separate robbery, and authorities are investigating links to other high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities in the area.</p>

The proposed maps are part of a Democratic strategy to gain more House seats in California. Solis has already secured a formidable list of endorsements from prominent figures, signaling strong establishment support for her potential candidacy.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his college class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a dock on Long Island, New York. Al DiStefano, now 77, had long considered the 1969 Fordham University ring lost forever. It was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector, who then used the engravings to track down DiStefano through a university alumni group on Facebook. The discovery and return of the palladium ring has been described as a "miracle" by DiStefano, highlighting a remarkable story of loss, chance, and kindness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded August on a positive note, with the S&P 500 advancing roughly 2% for its fourth consecutive monthly gain. However, the final week of the month ended with a slight decline, breaking a four-week winning streak as investors took profits ahead of the Labor Day weekend. Market activity was influenced by Nvidia's strong earnings report, which was met with some investor scrutiny, and the latest PCE inflation data that showed persistent price pressures. Despite the weekly dip, the overall monthly performance reflected underlying market strength amid ongoing economic uncertainty and anticipation of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision.

          <p>Paleontologists have identified one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, a 165-million-year-old species named Spicomellus, which is the world's oldest known ankylosaur. Based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco, the herbivorous dinosaur was covered in long, bony spikes that were uniquely fused directly to its rib bones, a feature unseen in any other known vertebrate. This elaborate armor, which researchers have likened to a "punk rocker," challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs. Scientists had previously believed that their defensive armor developed gradually over time, but this early specimen suggests a far more complex and bizarre beginning.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has been reelected in a landslide victory, four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. In 2020, Braxton became mayor-elect after running unopposed, but the incumbent government refused to recognize his authority. Following a federal lawsuit and settlement over the town's decades-long practice of appointing officials without elections, this week's vote was the first held since the 1960s. Braxton's decisive win is seen as a significant turning point for democratic governance in the small, majority-Black town.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months, setting up a high-stakes contest. The seat, formerly held by a Democrat, is crucial as Democrats currently hold a slim 19-18 majority in the chamber. A Republican victory would result in a tied Senate, potentially allowing the GOP to block parts of Whitmer's legislative agenda in her final year as governor. Whitmer had faced criticism for the long delay in calling the election, which will now take place with a primary in February and a general election in May 2026.</p>
