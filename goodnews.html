          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko to become the country's new prime minister, aiming to significantly renew the government's work amid the ongoing war with Russia. Svyrydenko, 39, is credited with successfully negotiating a key mineral deal with the United States and has risen quickly through government ranks. Her appointment, which requires parliamentary approval, would make her the second female prime minister in Ukraine's history. The move is part of a broader cabinet reshuffle as Zelenskyy seeks to strengthen Ukraine's leadership.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has requested an inspector general review of a costly expansion project for the central bank's Washington, D.C. headquarters. The project has drawn sharp criticism from the White House, with officials accusing the Fed of "fundamental mismanagement" and "excess spending" on what was initially a $2.5 billion renovation. The Fed, which is self-funded and not reliant on taxpayer money, has defended the project as necessary to remediate safety hazards like asbestos and bring the buildings up to modern code. This internal review follows public pressure and accusations of fiscal irresponsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has minimized U.S. concerns that China's military could utilize his company's advanced AI chips, arguing that China cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. In a CNN interview, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to maintaining America's global tech leadership, as half of the world's AI developers are in China. His comments come as he navigates the delicate relationship between Washington and Beijing, attempting to maintain market access while complying with U.S. restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses may have secured a more favorable draw in the Euro 2025 knockout stages by finishing second in their group, a result some fans were hoping for. This placement means they will face Sweden in the quarter-finals, avoiding a clash with eight-time champions Germany. More significantly, they are now in the opposite side of the bracket from World Cup winners and tournament favorites, Spain, whom they cannot meet until a potential final. While Sweden presents a tough challenge, this path avoids two of the strongest contenders for the title in earlier rounds.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act" to address a significant disparity in vehicle crash safety, where women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured than men. The legislation aims to mandate the use of advanced crash test dummies that better represent the female population, as current tests primarily use a dummy based on an average-sized male from the 1990s. Proponents argue that using dummies reflecting female anatomy and size is crucial for gathering data to design safer cars for everyone. The push for equality in testing comes as safety advocates call for urgent updates to federal standards.</p>

          <p>Despite its stock price dipping, industrial manufacturer Dover received a strong endorsement from Citi, which named it a "Top Pick" and raised its price target to $226 per share. Analysts believe the market is underappreciating Dover's potential for growth, citing a portfolio of high-margin businesses that are showing positive demand trends in areas like biopharma and beverage can making. The stock's recent weakness may be linked to President Trump's tariff threats, as a significant portion of Dover's costs originate in Europe. However, the company has previously managed tariff impacts through mitigation and pricing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's export growth accelerated in June, partly due to a rush of orders from U.S. companies trying to stock up before a potential reinstatement of higher tariffs in August. While exports to the United States still fell by 16% year-over-year, this was a significant improvement from the 34.5% drop in May, indicating a temporary surge in activity during a 90-day tariff truce. However, the overall outlook remains uncertain as trade talks have shown little progress. The data shows that despite the trade war, China's global trade has continued to grow, with exports to Southeast Asia and Europe increasing significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the right certificate of deposit (CD) term. Some experts suggest that short-term CDs remain a strong option, as banks are currently offering competitive rates on them in anticipation of future rate drops. Others argue that locking in a higher yield with a longer-term CD now could be advantageous before rates fall. For those uncertain, a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms, is recommended to balance access to funds with securing favorable long-term rates.

The deal, facilitated by Germany and paid for by European allies, provides Ukraine with a sophisticated weapon it has previously used.

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements surged by 60% in June compared to the previous year, reaching their highest level in over a decade. This significant increase may be an early sign that Beijing is relaxing its stringent export controls, potentially as a result of recent behind-the-scenes agreements with the United States on the flow of critical minerals. The move follows reports that China had issued six-month export licenses to select American manufacturers.
