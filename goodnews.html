          <p>Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu utilized AI-generated avatars based on Baidu's generative AI model for a livestreaming session on Baidu's e-commerce platform, generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million). The avatars, trained on five years of videos, mimicked their jokes and style, resulting in higher sales compared to Luo's previous livestream. Luo expressed amazement at the effectiveness of the digital human technology, noting its potential impact on the influencer market. This collaboration between Baidu and Luo Yonghao demonstrates the growing capabilities of AI in sales and marketing. Optimism is tempered by the potential job displacement in the influencer industry.</p>

The judge ruled that the states were likely to succeed on their claims that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage. The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. The ruling follows Trump's calls to cut off federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions that do not cooperate with ICE.</p>
