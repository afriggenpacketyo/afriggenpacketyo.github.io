          <p>London Pulse has won its first-ever Netball Super League championship, defeating Loughborough Lightning 53-45 in the Grand Final at London's O2 Arena. The victory prevented Lightning from achieving a third consecutive title and completed a treble for Pulse, who also won the regular season and the Netball Super Cup. A standout defensive performance by Funmi Fadoju, who was named player of the match, was crucial to the win. The match also saw 16-year-old Gracie Smith become the youngest player to feature in a Grand Final, highlighting a momentous day for the London club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant failure of the electronic line-calling system disrupted a fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, causing controversy on the court. The system failed to make an "out" call on a clear long shot from Kartal at a critical moment in the first set, forcing the umpire to replay the point. Pavlyuchenkova, who argued a game was "stolen" from her, expressed frustration that the chair umpire did not overrule the system's error. Although she ultimately won the match, the incident has sparked debate about the reliability of the new automated system.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. While the immediate storm warnings have been canceled, the system is still expected to bring heavy rainfall to the Carolinas through Monday. Forecasters anticipate 2 to 4 inches of rain, with some areas receiving up to 6 inches, which raises concerns about potential flash flooding as the weather system moves inland. Authorities had previously warned residents about the possibility of minor coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes, urging caution on the roads.</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle crash in Herriman, Utah, ended in a dramatic explosion after an SUV struck a Domino's Pizza restaurant and ruptured a gas line. Two occupants of the SUV were rescued by courageous bystanders just minutes before the vehicle and building were engulfed in flames. The subsequent explosion destroyed the Domino's and caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, but no one was inside the building at the time. While multiple people from the initial accident were hospitalized, no injuries were reported from the explosion itself, and firefighters on the scene were unharmed.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has indicated that the "rough outlines" of several international trade deals are becoming clear as a key tariff deadline approaches. With a 90-day pause on sweeping U.S. tariffs set to expire, Hassett stated that some deals will be finalized this week, while letters will be sent to other nations where negotiations are less advanced. He suggested that President Trump's threat of high tariffs has successfully incentivized countries and companies to increase their economic activity within the U.S. The administration's strategy aims to secure more favorable trade terms.

          <p>A veteran analyst has updated stock price targets for AMD and Super Micro Computer, highlighting their growing roles in the artificial intelligence sector as alternatives to the dominant Nvidia. AMD is gaining traction with its new Instinct MI350 series GPUs, which are reportedly being tested by major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. Concurrently, Supermicro is solidifying its position in AI infrastructure, evidenced by a massive $20 billion deal to supply its liquid-cooled GPU racks for new AI campuses.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first home victory at a chaotic and rain-affected British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Norris took the lead after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, was given a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. Piastri had led for most of the race but finished second after serving the penalty during his final pit stop. In a surprising result, Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg secured his first-ever podium finish in his 239th race, holding off Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton to take third place in front of a record crowd.</p>

          <p>Thailand is offering to significantly increase its trade with the U.S. and slash its $46 billion trade surplus by 70% over five years in an effort to avoid steep American tariffs. The proposal comes as a July 9 deadline approaches, after which Washington has threatened to impose a 36% levy on Thai imports if a new deal is not reached. According to Thailand's finance minister, the country is hoping to secure a baseline tariff rate of 10% but would find a rate between 10% and 20% acceptable. The revised offer is expected to be submitted before the deadline. (not investment advice)</p>
