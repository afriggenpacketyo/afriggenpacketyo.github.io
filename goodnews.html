          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned numerous generals, admirals, and their respective staffs from around the world to an urgent, rare meeting in Quantico, Virginia, next week. This significant gathering, confirmed by U.S. officials, is highly unusual due to its substantial size and the short notice provided, indicating a critical agenda to be addressed by the Secretary of War. While regular senior military leader meetings are common, an assembly of this magnitude on such short notice is considered unprecedented. The specific details regarding the topics of discussion remain undisclosed, contributing to the heightened attention surrounding this event and signaling potentially pressing global security concerns that require immediate high-level coordination.</p>

          <p>England and Canada have confirmed unchanged teams for the Women's Rugby World Cup final this Saturday at Twickenham, promising a highly anticipated clash between the world's top two sides. England's Red Roses, led by Zoe Aldcroft and boasting a record 32-Test winning streak, seek to reclaim the title they last won in 2014, having lost the previous two finals. Their opponents, Canada, a semi-professional team that partially crowdfunded their World Cup campaign, are making their first final appearance since 2014. The match is poised to be a landmark event for women's rugby, with a sold-out Twickenham expected to host a record-breaking crowd of 82,000.</p>

          <p>Interpol has successfully identified "the woman in pink" as Liudmila Zavada, a Russian national, two decades after her body was found by a road in Barcelona, Spain. Her identification was a direct result of Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, launched in 2023 to resolve cold cases of women murdered or found under suspicious circumstances across Europe. Spanish police submitted the case in 2024, leading to a fingerprint match by Turkish authorities and subsequent DNA confirmation from a relative. Zavada was 31 when she died, and her case's resolution provides renewed hope for the 44 other women still awaiting identification through this crucial international initiative.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department's final revision of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data. This figure, higher than previous estimates, indicates a strong rebound from the first quarter's 0.6% drop. Consumer spending significantly buoyed the economy, rising at a 2.5% pace, surpassing earlier projections and demonstrating continued resilience despite broader economic challenges like tariffs. This unexpectedly strong GDP performance suggests the economy remains on solid footing, potentially dampening the Federal Reserve's urgency for additional rate cuts planned for late 2025 and early 2026.

          <p>The return to school has prompted renewed concerns about head lice infestations, which affect up to 12 million U.S. children aged 3-11 annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clarifies that head lice spread mainly through direct head-to-head contact, not poor hygiene, and cannot jump, hop, or fly. Prevention involves avoiding sharing personal items and close contact during activities. Symptoms, such as scalp itching, can take up to six weeks to manifest. Various treatments exist, from FDA-approved over-the-counter products to professional services, and experts stress that lice are not a health hazard, urging schools to update policies that unnecessarily exclude affected students.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned that U.S. stocks are "fairly highly valued," a sentiment that caused markets to dip slightly. His remarks indicate that, by various measures like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, stocks appear overvalued. The S&P 500 currently trades at a 41% premium to its 20-year average P/E, suggesting prices are significantly higher than historical norms. While a long-term, diversified approach is typically advised for everyday investors, Powell's comments underscore a professional concern about market sustainability.

The telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument revealed gas and dust with extraordinary detail, while its Near-Infrared Camera showcased vibrant stars illuminating bright cosmic clouds.

The positive jobless claims data, alongside a revised 3.8% GDP growth in the second quarter and a rise in durable goods orders, points to a resilient underlying economy.

This generation utilizes an expanded lexicon, featuring terms like "sneaky links," "zombies," and various "situationships," which reflect a more fluid and individualized approach to romantic and sexual encounters. While some older generations find these evolving dynamics complicated, Gen Z prioritizes autonomy and self-discovery, exhibiting less pressure to conform to traditional sexual or relationship milestones. However, experts observe a paradox: despite being more open about sexual topics in general, many Gen Zers struggle with vulnerability and direct communication of preferences in intimate settings, often adopting a "nonchalant" attitude to avoid perceived emotional investment.</p>
