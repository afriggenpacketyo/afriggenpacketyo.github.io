        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound, betaine, as a key factor in how long-term exercise slows the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine is produced in the kidneys during exercise and works by inhibiting an enzyme linked to inflammation and organ aging. This discovery provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential for future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the effects of exercise.</p>
