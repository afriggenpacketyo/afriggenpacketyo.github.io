        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals of the French Open, continuing his pursuit of a record 25th Grand Slam singles title. Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, overcoming moments where he felt "a little bit flat," as he put it. Norrie, despite playing in the last 16 at Roland Garros for the first time, couldn't capitalize on his opportunities, particularly in the second set when he led by a break. Djokovic is set to face Alexander Zverev in the next round, a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final where Zverev won after Djokovic suffered a hamstring injury.</p>

          <p>Opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June 2025 could be a prudent financial move, offering protection against potential interest rate cuts and stock market volatility. While the Federal Reserve has paused rate cuts in the first half of 2025, analysts anticipate cuts later in the summer, potentially reducing CD interest rates. A long-term CD provides a fixed interest rate, shielding savings from market instability and ensuring predictable returns. Depending on the term and rate, savers could earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest, making it a simple and safe way to grow money (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen reports that consumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend, observed across all income brackets in the meals and beverages category, suggests people are tightening their wallets amid economic uncertainty. The increase in home cooking mirrors the economic anxieties experienced during the pandemic's initial phase, marked by widespread disruptions in spending and employment. The trend comes as economists and Wall Street analysts consider the potential impacts of President Trump's tariff policies on consumer sentiment and the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, erupted on Monday, sending a massive plume of ash and lava into the sky. The National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology noted increasing explosions from the volcano's southeast crater, eventually leading to a lava fountain. While the summit area was closed to tour groups as a precaution, officials stated that the pyroclastic flows posed no danger to the population. Mount Etna has erupted frequently in recent years, often covering nearby towns in volcanic dust but without causing major problems.</p>

This upgrade comes after Boeing's stock has already seen significant gains over the past seven weeks, driven by positive trade deal announcements, including a major order from British Airways' parent company. Analysts believe Boeing is poised to benefit from further trade deals, and improvements to operations that CEO Kelly Ortberg has put in place.

          <p>Stephen Curry, despite being a four-time NBA champion and two-time MVP, admits to experiencing impostor syndrome, highlighting that even high-achievers face self-doubt. Curry, son of former NBA player Dell Curry, said he didn't grow up with the expectation of playing in the league due to his stature and underdog mentality. He has embraced his underdog status as motivation and found success both on and off the court, leading Thirty Ink and giving back through his nonprofit Eat. Learn. Play. Curry acknowledges the pressure of balancing his various commitments and strives to be a better husband and father while managing his public image.</p>
