          <p>New York City is moving forward with its 'Trash Revolution' by requiring large residential buildings in West Harlem to use large bins on the street instead of piling trash on the curb. The initiative aims to improve sanitation and reduce the presence of garbage bags on sidewalks. Mayor wants to expand the bin system citywide, seeking to transform the city's approach to waste management. The new system is intended to create a cleaner and more organized urban environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. The decision is a significant victory for gun safety advocates, upholding a ruling by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that the state can constitutionally prohibit the sale and possession of these weapons. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, expressing their desire to address the issue nationwide, while Justice Kavanaugh expects the high court to weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the near future. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons.</p>

          <p>Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain tech startup, has successfully closed a $650 million funding round. The funding will be used to expand the company's technology to more patients and develop new devices that enhance the connection between biological and artificial intelligence. Neuralink is developing a brain-computer interface (BCI) called Telepathy, which involves inserting 64 threads into the brain to record neural signals. Five patients have already been implanted with Neuralink's technology and can control digital and physical devices with their thoughts, which has been the company's stated goal since its inception.</p>

          <p>One of the two eaglets born to famed bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow in Big Bear, California, has successfully taken its first flight. The eaglet, named Sunny, was observed jumping off a branch and flying away, while her sister, Gizmo, remained in the nest. Friends of Big Bear Valley noted that the eaglets had been practicing for their first flight by flapping and jumping on the outer rails of their nest. Both eaglets are female and are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own.</p>
