        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As countries like South Korea pivot towards stablecoins, questions arise about their difference from central bank digital currencies like China's e-CNY. The digital yuan is a state-controlled currency intended for small, domestic retail payments and is not exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, with issuers holding reserve assets to back their value, representing a fundamentally different approach to design, purpose, and management within the digital currency landscape.

          <p>This opinion article suggests that despite the high-profile victory of a democratic socialist in a New York primary, the true future leaders of the Democratic Party are pragmatic, center-left figures like gubernatorial nominees Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. The author contends that their focus on kitchen-table economics, coalition building, and winning in competitive districts offers a more viable path to building durable majorities than ideological purity tests. The article posits that their success demonstrates a winning formula based on persuasion over performative politics.</p>

          <h2>The History of Barbecue Traced from Indigenous Caribbean Roots to American Tradition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The quintessential American tradition of barbecue has its origins with the Indigenous Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean. The term itself derives from the Ta√≠no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used for slow-cooking meat over a fire. Spanish explorers later adapted the word to "barbacoa" and spread the cooking method, which has since evolved into diverse regional styles across the United States. This rich history connects the modern July Fourth cookout to a culinary practice that predates European arrival in the Americas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill, passed by the Senate, proposes to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to bolster the domestic chip supply chain and incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand their American operations. The move builds on the 2022 CHIPS Act but reflects the administration's preference for using tariffs and tax incentives to onshore production, potentially accelerating the trend of chipmakers increasing their U.S. investments.

This politically charged decision is a direct challenge to Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next Dalai Lama, setting the stage for potential rival claimants.</p>

If the deal is approved, Santander intends to fully integrate TSB into its UK operations, creating Britain's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While decisions on branding are pending, Santander has a history of absorbing the brands of banks it acquires, and the deal is expected to lead to job cuts and branch consolidation as the two networks are combined to create efficiencies.</p>

Beijing believes that regulating this behavior is crucial for fostering innovation, improving product quality, and promoting the exit of outdated industrial capacity, thereby stabilizing the world's second-largest economy.
