        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that President Trump's policies and the global turmoil they created influenced the Australian election, bolstering the re-election of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, his presence was felt throughout the campaign, particularly concerning the cost-of-living crisis. The leader of the conservative opposition, Peter Dutton, earned the nickname "Temu Trump" for espousing some of Trump's ideas, contributing to his defeat. The election results reflect a rejection of Trump-like politics in Australia, favoring sensible, centrist approaches.</p>

          <p>Native American women are reclaiming the tradition of facial tattoos, known as inchunwa, as a symbol of cultural identity and commitment to their communities. The Inchunwa Project is working to revitalize the practice among south-eastern Indigenous nations, offering retreats and resources for those interested in receiving or learning about the tattoos. Receiving inchunwa is a deeply personal and spiritual experience, often reflecting an individual's journey and connection to their ancestors. The revitalization efforts are part of a broader movement to reclaim traditions after the colonial era and forced assimilation.</p>

Both Bowman and Jones lead independent and fulfilling lives, underscoring the importance of support and opportunity rather than pity or stereotypes for individuals with autism.
