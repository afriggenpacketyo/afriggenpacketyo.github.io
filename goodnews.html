          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Factors contributing to the rally include concerns about broader macro concerns, such as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.

          <p>China has urged the European Union to provide a ‚Äúfair‚Äù playing field for businesses after Brussels proposed a handling fee on every small parcel that enters the bloc, most of which come from the country‚Äôs rapidly expanding e-commerce firms. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas. For parcels sent to a European warehouse to be stored, the fee would be only 50 cents per parcel. The fee would add around 3 billion euros of income to Brussels‚Äô budget.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng are set to extend their blistering rally of nearly 80% this year, according to analysts, as the Chinese electric-vehicle maker introduces newer models and moves toward profitability. Xpeng's shares in Hong Kong surged over 10% Thursday following upbeat earnings and stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts expect Xpeng to turn profitable in the fourth quarter this year, thanks to its strong sales momentum and pipeline of new models. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock and pegs target price at 150 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
