          <p>Jen Pawol made history by becoming the first female umpire to officiate a Major League Baseball regular-season game, working at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was celebrated by family and friends, and she received a warm reception from players and fans. Following the game, the 48-year-old donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Pawol's promotion comes after years of umpiring in the minor leagues, and her achievement has been praised by MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred as a testament to her dedication.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner publicly responded to a social media user who criticized her for attending an Oasis concert without her two children. Turner pointed out the existence of shared custody arrangements with her ex-husband, Joe Jonas, suggesting the children were with their father. The exchange occurred on a post where Turner shared photos from the concert, and her witty clap-back received significant support from her followers. The article notes this follows her and Jonas's finalized divorce and a period where Turner felt unfairly portrayed in the media as a bad mother.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years, defeating American JJ Spaun in a sudden-death playoff at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis. The 45-year-old won on the third extra hole after both players finished the tournament at 16-under-par. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a lead but finished tied for third, still seeking his first PGA Tour win. Rose's triumph marks his 12th title on the tour and makes him the first player in his 40s to win this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England find jobs within the National Health Service (NHS). The plan aims to simplify regulations, allowing NHS trusts to hire graduates based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise, addressing a situation where there are more graduates than available positions. Nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the initiative but stressed that its success depends on actual job creation. However, NHS Providers, representing trusts, raised concerns about how these new measures would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

Lance demonstrated growing confidence, using his mobility to extend plays and scoring a five-yard rushing touchdown. In contrast, Taylor Heinicke, his main competitor, appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The article also highlights strong performances from edge rusher Caleb Murphy and undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rogers, who had two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, making a strong case for a roster spot.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed for Adidas Originals appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans but was reportedly produced in China without their partnership or credit. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, and the country's culture ministry is in discussion with Adidas about restitution. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in collaboration with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed from social media.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a recently divorced father on how to handle paying his ex-wife her $150,000 share of their home's equity. The caller, who has an exceptionally low 2.25% mortgage rate, was considering a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to cover the payment. Ramsey made a rare exception to his anti-debt stance, agreeing that restructuring the debt to a HELOC was a sensible way to pay the ex-wife. However, he also questioned the caller's emotional attachment to the house, suggesting that keeping it for the sake of his young children might be misguided. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Historian Rana Mitter Discusses the Underestimated Impact of World War II on Modern China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, argues that the impact of World War II on the nation is frequently underestimated in both China and the West. In this article, he explains that Japan's invasion during the war was a pivotal event that shaped contemporary Chinese politics, society, and culture. According to Mitter, the conflict effectively destroyed the infrastructure and communications networks that had been built in the 1920s and 1930s. This devastation forced China to essentially start over in its development after the war concluded, profoundly influencing its subsequent trajectory.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive, ruling that commercial fishing remains illegal in the expanded areas of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had allowed fishing in waters protected by President Obama in 2014. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public comment process for changing the rules. The ruling is being celebrated as a major victory for the protection of the monument's unique and vulnerable marine ecosystems and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>UCLA police have arrested a suspect on campus in connection with a series of incidents being investigated as potential hate crimes since February 2025.

The suspect faces burglary and weapons charges, with a possible hate crime enhancement, though it was not immediately clear if they were affiliated with the university.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer as Trent Rockets secured a five-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers, continuing their undefeated start in the men's Hundred cricket tournament. The 20-year-old first made an impact with the ball, taking two wickets for 23 runs to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest total of 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase, which the Rockets completed with four balls remaining. Despite a mid-innings wobble against the Superchargers' spinners, the Rockets' depth saw them comfortably to their target.</p>
