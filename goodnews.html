Waabi anticipates deploying fully driverless trucks on routes across the U.S. Southwest by the end of the year, a region chosen for its high freight volume and favorable weather conditions. Ron will continue as chairman of Uber Freight, which will now be led by Rebecca Tinucci. The shift underscores a broader industry focus on automation for increased efficiency and safety.</p>

          <p>HMRC, the UK's tax authority, has confirmed its use of artificial intelligence to monitor social media posts as part of criminal investigations into suspected tax cheats. The agency stated that this technology will enable staff to spend less time on administration and more on assisting taxpayers, while also better targeting fraud and evasion to increase public funds. HMRC emphasized that AI would not replace "human decision-making" and is subject to legal oversight. Experts, however, warn of potential risks like mistaken identity due to fake or hacked accounts, stressing the continued necessity for human intervention to ensure appropriate decisions.</p>

E.l.f. has achieved 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and is recognized as the top color cosmetics brand in the U.S. by units sold, and a favorite among Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennial consumers. The Rhode acquisition will expand E.l.f.'s market presence into Sephora stores this fall.

          <p>A recent US-China tariff truce has provided temporary relief, but experts warn that significant breakthroughs in trade negotiations remain unlikely in the short term. Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING, suggests that while neither party benefits from a re-escalation of tariffs, a "grand bargain" to resolve all issues once and for all is improbable, predicting continued extensions and adjustments. President Trump indicated a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping later this year if both sides can progress on a trade deal. The situation underscores the ongoing difficulty and resilience test for trade relations between the two superpowers, suggesting a prolonged period of negotiation.</p>

          <h2>Employee Happiness Identified as Key Driver of Business Performance, Not Management Fads</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 11:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article introduces a "management anti-fad" that prioritizes employee happiness to boost business performance, challenging traditional, often ineffective, management fads like Six Sigma. Recent research, including studies by the investment-research firm Irrational Capital, demonstrates a strong correlation between employee well-being and increased productivity and profitability. The firm identified six key factors of employee satisfaction—innovation, direct management, organizational effectiveness, engagement, emotional connection, and organizational alignment—which consistently outperform extrinsic rewards like pay in boosting stock price. The article advocates for managers to focus on these human-centric elements, emphasizing that treating employees as more than machines leads to lasting organizational success and improved quality of life.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Guidance on Money Market vs. High-Yield Savings Accounts Amid Rate Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 10:55:07 EDT</div>
        </div>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve moves forward with rate cuts, financial experts are advising savers on the optimal choice between money market accounts (MMAs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Both offer variable, above-average interest rates and FDIC insurance, providing a safe place for savings. A key distinction is that MMAs typically include a debit card and check-writing capabilities, though they might require higher minimum balances or tiered rates. HYSAs often have lower barriers to entry and are generally recommended for emergency funds or short-term savings goals due to their ease and flexibility. It is crucial for individuals to compare APYs, minimums, and accessibility features to align with their specific financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Strategic Options for Managing Required Minimum Distributions in Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 10:53:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With year-end approaching, many older Americans must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their pretax retirement accounts starting at age 73, facing IRS penalties if they don't. For retirees who don't immediately need the money, several strategic options exist. Experts suggest reinvesting RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, favoring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for their tax efficiency and ease of tax-loss harvesting. Charitable individuals aged 70½ or older can utilize qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) for a tax-free transfer directly to eligible non-profits, satisfying RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, RMDs can be contributed to a 529 college savings plan for family, offering state tax benefits and legacy planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is reportedly "adamant" about leaving the club to join Liverpool this summer, despite Newcastle having rejected a substantial £110 million bid. While BBC Sport could not independently verify the player's extreme stance, it is understood that joining the Premier League champions remains the 25-year-old Swede's "determined" ambition before the September 1 transfer deadline. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has indicated that Isak will not be involved in his current plans, suggesting the striker is expected to miss the Premier League opener against Aston Villa. Isak, who scored 27 goals in 42 appearances last season, has three years remaining on his current deal.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly intensifying its pursuit of Crystal Palace and England center-back Marc Guehi, who has one year remaining on his contract with Palace. Club chairman Steve Parish indicated a potential sale this summer to prevent the defender from leaving on a free transfer in 12 months. Sources close to the situation suggest that Liverpool has held initial talks regarding a potential deal for the 25-year-old. If an agreement is reached between the clubs, Liverpool may still need to persuade Guehi on the level of playing time he would receive, which is a crucial consideration for him in a World Cup year, given his regular role at Palace.</p>

The company continues to gain significant market share, particularly in its running segment, and has seen strong growth in key markets like the U.S. and China, where sales grew approximately 50% in the second quarter.
