          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have reached a 'framework' deal regarding TikTok, suggesting potential U.S.-controlled ownership of the platform. President Trump confirmed a deal was reached on a 'certain' company that young people wanted to save. The agreement, made during trade discussions, addresses concerns over TikTok's foreign adversary-controlled application status, which led to a law prohibiting its distribution in the U.S. Bessent indicated that Trump and President Xi Jinping will discuss the terms of the deal on Friday, while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested the September 17 deadline for ByteDance to divest may need to be pushed back. This framework aims to resolve national security concerns while preserving the app's popularity. The agreement is a sign of progress in trade relations between the two countries. Optimism is moderate as it is a financial deal with good intentions.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a jump after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his purchase of 2.57 million shares, totaling approximately $1 billion, his first open market stock acquisition since February 2020. This move is seen by traders as a sign of confidence from Musk, despite analysts' mixed opinions on the stock's future. Tesla's stock has faced challenges this year due to slumping sales and the end of certain incentives for electric vehicles. Musk's purchase coincides with the company seeking shareholder approval for a new pay package that could be worth up to $975 billion, contingent on ambitious milestones. This insider purchase signals Musk's commitment to Tesla's long-term vision, particularly in autonomous driving, A.I., and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The watermelon has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian resistance due to its colors mirroring the Palestinian flag, which was once banned in the occupied territories. During the 1980s, Israeli authorities prohibited the display of the Palestinian flag, leading artists to use watermelons as a subversive alternative. The fruit has since appeared in various forms of art and protest, representing Palestinian identity and solidarity. While the watermelon has also been used in the United States to stereotype Black people, its use in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and on social media serves as a potent symbol of support. The article highlights the complex and evolving symbolism of the watermelon in different cultural contexts. The optimism score reflects the ongoing struggle and resilience of the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's designation of a condominium as a "vacation home" in a loan estimate may weaken allegations of mortgage fraud by the Trump administration. Trump has sought to remove Cook from the Fed, claiming she designated two properties as primary residences simultaneously. Cook has sued to block her firing, and a court has granted her an injunction to remain in her position. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the matter, and the White House has not commented on the issue. The optimism score reflects the legal and political uncertainty surrounding the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

Earlier this month, Tesla released a proposed pay package for Musk that would potentially make him the world's first trillionaire if he hits aggressive targets. The company has seen a plunge in sales this year, partly due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. (not investment advice)</p>
