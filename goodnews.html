          <p>A U.S. federal court has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut approximately $2.2 billion in research funding to Harvard University. The judge ruled that the move violated the university's First Amendment rights, suggesting the administration used claims of antisemitism as a pretext for an ideologically motivated action against the institution. While acknowledging Harvard could have better addressed antisemitism, the ruling blocks the government from withholding any further federal funding or payments on existing grants, marking a significant legal victory for the university.</p>

The lawsuit claimed that the shift to online learning disproportionately harmed Black and Latino students. The settlement mandates small-group tutoring, regular assessments, and more transparent reporting on student progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled against forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser as part of the remedy in a major antitrust case, causing parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. While the judge deemed Google a monopolist, the decision spared the company its most severe potential penalty, calling a divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." However, the ruling does impose other limits, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to help restore competition. The Department of Justice called the remedies an important step forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Advanced DNA Testing Permitted in Gilgo Beach Serial Killer Trial, Setting New York Precedent</h2>

          <p>A judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing, can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This decision sets a legal precedent for New York state courts, allowing prosecutors to present evidence connecting Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on victims' remains. The defense challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, but prosecutors hailed it as a major victory. This cutting-edge forensic technique allows for DNA extraction from degraded samples previously considered unusable.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress and their families from trading or owning individual stocks. The Restore Trust in Congress Act consolidates several previous proposals and would require lawmakers to sell their individual stocks shortly after taking office, with significant financial penalties for violations. The bill has garnered support from across the political spectrum, and its backers are threatening to force a floor vote if leadership does not bring it up for consideration, reflecting growing public pressure for such a reform.</p>
