          <p>The business travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed to go public, aiming to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol "NAVN." According to its S-1 filing, the company, formerly known as TripActions, reported $613 million in revenue over the last twelve months, serving over 10,000 customers. This move comes as the IPO market shows strong signs of recovery, with 2025 being the most active year for public offerings since the boom in 2021. Navan's filing highlights its significant growth and its use of AI to streamline corporate travel and expense processes for major clients like Unilever and Adobe. (not investment advice)</p>

Elliott has expressed support for Workday's management and new CEO Carl Eschenbach, suggesting a collaborative approach rather than a hostile takeover.

          <p>A partnership between Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, led by Turki al-Sheikh, and TKO Group Holdings is set to launch Zuffa Boxing, a venture aiming to dominate the sport. This initiative seeks to create a league-style structure, moving away from boxing's reliance on disparate promoters and sanctioning bodies, similar to the UFC model. The collaboration's first major event was the Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight, designed to establish the Zuffa brand despite anticipated financial losses underwritten by Saudi's Public Investment Fund. The plan raises questions about fighter compensation and control, as it could centralize power and alter the economic landscape of professional boxing.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data reveals that Tampa, Florida, experienced the fastest growth in median household income among major cities, with a 15% increase between 2023 and 2024. Four California cities—Long Beach, San Jose, San Francisco, and Fresno—also ranked in the top ten for income growth, largely driven by the high-paying tech sector. While the national median income saw a modest rise of just over 1%, these urban centers demonstrated significantly more economic volatility and potential for wage expansion. However, in some cities like Baltimore, substantial percentage growth did not elevate the median income above the national average. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have called on the UK government to establish emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the significant backlog of asylum claims and reduce reliance on costly hotel accommodations. During their annual conference, the party's home affairs spokesperson, Lisa Smart, outlined a plan that also includes doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite application processing. The concept is inspired by the temporary Nightingale hospitals created during the COVID-19 pandemic. The party also proposed opening more accessible police desks in public venues like supermarkets to improve community policing and make crime reporting easier for the public.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-pound American bomb from World War II was successfully defused in Hong Kong after being discovered at a construction site in the busy Quarry Bay district. The discovery prompted the evacuation of thousands of residents from approximately 1,900 households while police conducted the delicate, day-long operation to neutralize the device. No injuries were reported. The presence of such ordnance is a lingering legacy of the war, during which Allied forces bombed the then-Japanese-occupied city to disrupt military supply lines. Similar discoveries of unexploded WWII bombs continue to trigger large-scale evacuations across Europe and Asia.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic conclusion to the heptathlon at the World Championships in Tokyo, Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson shared the bronze medal with American Taliyah Brooks after both athletes finished with exactly 6,581 points. This marks the first time a world medal in the event has ever been split between two competitors. The emotional victory represents a continued resurgence for Johnson-Thompson, who suffered a career-threatening injury at the same stadium during the Olympics four years ago. American Anna Hall secured the gold medal, while Ireland's Kate O'Connor claimed a historic silver, her country's first-ever global multi-event medal.</p>

          <p>A retired grandfather's severe and persistent heartburn, which led to a fear of eating and significant weight loss, was ultimately diagnosed as mesenteric ischemia, a rare and serious condition. The illness is caused by narrowed arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine, leading to intense pain and malnutrition. After initial tests failed to identify the problem, a stomach scan revealed the condition, which his doctor had only seen once before. He was successfully treated with a minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in the affected artery, allowing him to eat normally again and highlighting the importance of patient self-advocacy.</p>

          <p>A surge in private market valuations, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom, has pushed a group of seven leading tech startups to a collective worth of $1.3 trillion. OpenAI leads the pack, with other major players like SpaceX, Anthropic, and Databricks seeing astronomical markups over the past year. According to Forge Global, this growth reflects genuine revenue increases, not just speculation, as AI firms attract the vast majority of all private-market capital. With such easy access to funding, these companies have little incentive to go public, instead remaining private while still having a significant impact on public markets through major contracts and partnerships.

          <p>Meta has unveiled its next-generation Ray-Ban smart glasses, the first consumer version to feature a built-in display, priced at $799. The device projects a small, translucent screen onto the right lens, allowing users to read messages, see photo previews, and view live captions. A key innovation is the accompanying EMG wristband, which detects electrical signals from hand muscles to enable gesture-based controls, such as pinching to open an app or rotating fingers to adjust volume. While the technology marks a step toward Meta's vision of augmented reality, the initial hands-on experience suggests the display is more for simple utility than immersive entertainment.</p>

          <p>Two German states, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, have passed new legislation to modernize funeral practices, reflecting changing societal attitudes toward mourning. The updated laws in Rhineland-Palatinate will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from cremation ashes. These changes cater to a growing demand for more personalized and less traditional memorial options, as cremation rates rise and the role of traditional cemeteries diminishes. The reforms have been welcomed by undertakers but have drawn criticism from Christian churches over concerns about dignified remembrance.</p>

According to the National Hurricane Center, the system is currently moving northwest over open waters and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. While it is not expected to make landfall in the Caribbean or the U.S., its projected track indicates it could pass east of Bermuda early next week as a stronger storm.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, widely regarded as the greatest pitcher of his generation, has announced his retirement after an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw was a constant force of excellence, leading the team through a tumultuous period that included a bankruptcy before its current era of sustained success. His career is decorated with three Cy Young Awards and a World Series championship, and his career 2.54 ERA is the lowest among pitchers with as many innings in the last century. His final season saw the Dodgers clinch a 13th consecutive postseason berth, a testament to the franchise revival he helped spearhead.</p>
