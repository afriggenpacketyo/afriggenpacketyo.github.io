          <p>Snowflake, a data analytics software maker, has announced its acquisition of Crunchy Data, a startup specializing in cloud-based database software, for approximately $250 million. Crunchy Data provides access to a cloud-hosted version of the PostgreSQL open-source database, which offers security and performance enhancements. This acquisition follows Databricks' recent announcement of its intent to acquire Neon, another PostgreSQL-based software company, highlighting the growing importance of PostgreSQL in the data analytics landscape. Snowflake plans to provide early access to a PostgreSQL database service, simplifying data movement into Snowflake for easier query execution on larger datasets, which will help them benefit from corporate spending to deliver artificial intelligence agents that carry out tasks on their own.

          <p>President Trump is promoting his "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a solution to what he calls the "four disastrous years" under former President Joe Biden. The bill, already passed by the House, aims to balance the budget, cut taxes, unleash American energy, and secure the border, Trump stated. Key provisions include increased border security, deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants, and the repeal of Biden's EV mandate. Senate Republicans are now reviewing the bill, with potential changes that may be challenging for House Speaker Mike Johnson to accept. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will expedite legislation to fast-track national projects to bolster Canada's economy in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The plan involves narrowing down a list of "nation-building" projects, including pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors, to be approved within two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's economy and autonomy, making it the strongest in the G7. This initiative follows Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and the auto sector, with plans to further increase levies on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts is nearing his return to the Dodgers' lineup after recovering from a fractured toe, participating in full pregame drills and expected to be available off the bench. However, Tyler Glasnow's progress has stalled due to general body discomfort after throwing his first bullpen session since going on the injured list with shoulder inflammation. Glasnow's return timeline is uncertain, while Blake Snell is making progress in his throwing progression and could begin throwing bullpens soon. Michael Kopech is completing a minor-league rehab assignment, and Kirby Yates is scheduled for a live batting practice, offering potential bullpen reinforcements.</p>

          <p>One of Big Bear's famed bald eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow, had one of their two eaglets take flight from the nest. The eaglet, Sunny, was seen jumping off a branch, flapping her wings and flying away, while her sister, Gizmo, remained behind. Sunny's flight was the result of days of practice, and young eagles often return to the nest after their first flight. Both eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, before venturing off on their own.</p>

          <p>NPR is asking parents to share the songs they sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that finds singing to babies lifts their moods and improves their overall well-being. The study found that infants who are sung to are happier throughout the day. Parents are encouraged to sing any type of song, not just lullabies, as anything that gives a baby a chance to hear their parent's voice is beneficial. NPR wants to know what songs help calm babies or put a smile on their face, and is inviting parents to upload recordings of themselves singing to their babies.</p>
