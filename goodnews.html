          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis held a massive rally in Tel Aviv, expressing profound gratitude to Donald Trump for his pivotal role in brokering a ceasefire and hostage return deal with Hamas in Gaza. US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the vast crowds, confirming that the hostages "are coming home," while many in attendance voiced their discontent by booing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Under the terms of the agreement, Hamas has a 72-hour window, beginning Friday night, to release all 48 remaining hostages, with 20 believed to be alive. This significant rally highlights strong public sentiment regarding the peace deal and leadership amidst ongoing regional tensions and the complex humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her initial shock and subsequent profound understanding of her 86-year-old mother, Patsy Cohen's, decision to donate her body to medical science after death. Her mother pragmatically views this act as a heartfelt way to express gratitude to medical professionals who saved her life and to help train future doctors, stating, "I'm not going to be wasted, it's going to do some good." Owen's documentary delves into Cardiff University's anatomy center, providing rare access to observe how medical students learn from real bodies and exploring the emotional journey for families of donors. The article highlights the crucial importance of such donations for medical education, the declining rates in recent years, and the long wait families may experience before a funeral can be held, ultimately inspiring Owen to make the same decision.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of travelers are actively utilizing AI chatbots like ChatGPT to plan various aspects of their holidays, from suggesting unique destinations to crafting detailed itineraries, as revealed by a recent ABTA report. Alan Smith, 62, successfully leveraged AI to discover Castro Urdiales, a charming Spanish seaside town that became a highlight of his family trip, appreciating its efficiency in consolidating travel information. However, other users, such as Hannah Read, experienced inaccuracies, like being advised of a non-existent ferry route from the UK to Norway, highlighting AI's limitations. Experts caution users to always fact-check AI recommendations and understand that while these tools have a valuable place in travel planning, they should not be relied upon entirely due to potential errors and their inherent tendency to be overly encouraging.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's rapid ascent has established it as a $500 billion goliath, exhibiting an unprecedented dominance in Silicon Valley unlike any previous tech giant, fundamentally reshaping the AI industry. The privately held company, with its secretive financials and unrivaled ability and willingness to spend capital, is aggressively investing across the entire AI stack, from data center development to consumer applications and hardware. CEO Sam Altman's whirlwind of massive infrastructure deals with partners like Nvidia and product rollouts, including the Sora AI video app and Codex, highlights its aggressive expansion and vertical integration. This rapid growth creates a "gold rush mentality" but also significant uncertainty for entrepreneurs navigating a market where OpenAI's immense momentum and strategic moves are redefining competitive dynamics.

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint expected to significantly redefine its infrastructure spending and investment strategy after decades of rapid, large-scale expansion. Previous plans, such as the 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package in 2009, spurred massive public works projects that helped economic growth but also contributed to local government debt, a persistent financial pressure. The upcoming iteration aims for more tech-driven and people-focused projects, seeking to address these financial burdens while continuing to leverage digital infrastructure as a key driver of economic growth. This comprehensive document will inform high-level policy priorities and is poised to shape the country's development trajectory and economic landscape for the next half-decade, reflecting a new era of strategic planning.

          <p>England's cricket captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and spinner Sophie Ecclestone are delivering "statement performances" in the World Cup, positioning England atop the table unbeaten ahead of major matches against India and Australia.

While England's schedule has been favorable, their strong and well-rounded bowling attack, particularly the spin trio, is proving highly effective on slow surfaces. This early success provides a significant confidence boost for the team, demonstrating their potential as underdogs and setting a strong foundation as they prepare for tougher competition in the tournament.</p>
