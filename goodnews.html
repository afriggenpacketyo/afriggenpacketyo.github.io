          <p>JPMorgan Chase is introducing a new wealth management tier, J.P. Morgan Private Client, aimed at affluent Americans with at least $750,000 in deposits and investments, with a focus on those having $2 to $3 million in balances. This initiative includes refurbished brick-and-mortar bank branches in upscale locations across New York, California, Florida, and Massachusetts, acquired from First Republic. The goal is to capture a larger share of affluent households' investment dollars, currently only at 10%, despite banking relationships with half of the 19 million affluent households in the U.S. The service emphasizes personalized, concierge-level service with dedicated bankers, similar to the approach that made First Republic successful.</p>

          <p>Ambience Healthcare, an AI startup, has announced a new medical coding model powered by OpenAI that surpasses physician benchmarks by 27%. The model identifies ICD-10 codes by listening to patient encounters, reducing billing errors and improving clinician efficiency. With approximately 70,000 ICD-10 codes, the model aims to streamline administrative tasks and make healthcare safer and more cost-effective. According to Ambience's head of engineering, the model is intended to liberate doctors and coders from administrative burdens rather than replace them.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates are currently offering higher returns than the inflation rate, making them an attractive savings option. The national average CD yields as of May 27, 2025, are 1.99% APY for a 1-year CD, 1.69% APY for a 3-year CD, and 1.70% APY for a 5-year CD, but top CDs offer significantly higher rates. To secure a good CD rate, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and explore short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve means short-term CDs currently have higher interest rates than longer-term options.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has downplayed an incident in which his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam. Video footage of the event circulated online, prompting Macron's office to initially deny its authenticity before confirming it as genuine, with Macron later stating that he and his wife were joking around. Sources close to the president described the incident as a harmless "squabble" and blamed pro-Russian accounts for the negative commentary surrounding the event. Macron is on a Southeast Asian tour, pitching France as a reliable alternative to the U.S. and China amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "bags fly free" policy, introducing a $35 fee for the first checked bag and a $45 fee for the second, effective for flights booked on or after May 28. Business Select/Choice Extra and A-List Preferred customers will still receive two free checked bags, while A-List and Chase Rapid Reward credit card members will get one free checked bag. Additionally, flight credits issued on or after May 28 will expire within six months or a year, depending on the fare type, marking a change from the previous policy of never-expiring flight credits.

It's important to compare different accounts, considering not only interest rates but also fees, to maximize your savings and prepare for future financial needs, such as emergencies.

          <p>Businesses are using the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing the duty price by stripping out the cost associated with the middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, the sales must be carried out at arm's length, and there must be proof that the item was destined for the U.S.</p>

As well as playing a key role in England's Euro 2022 victory, she was vice-captain as they reached the 2023 World Cup final, saving a penalty in their defeat by Spain. She used her platform to speak out, discussing her personal mental health struggles while collecting her award at the Fifa Best event in 2023. Her most notable intervention came when she called out Nike for failing to sell England women's goalkeeper shirts before the World Cup, which led to a petition gathering more than 150,000 signatures and the sportswear giant making a U-turn.</p>

          <p>A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gathering momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence. In just the last few weeks, Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power as part of a major policy shift, Spain reportedly signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power. The burgeoning trend appears to be driven, at least in part, by some of the costs associated with renewables, notably solar and wind technologies.</p>

Open-heart surgery was performed to remove the thickened pericardium, relieving the pressure on his heart. Mauceri has since recovered and returned to conducting, feeling stronger than ever.</p>
