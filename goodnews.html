        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, identifying it as the group responsible for the April Pahalgam attack in India that killed 26 people. U.S. officials described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. India has welcomed the decision, viewing it as a strong affirmation of U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. The designation is seen by experts as a sign of deepening support for India following the attack, which targeted mostly Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir and escalated regional tensions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:51:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has for the first time used visual effects created by generative artificial intelligence in an original production, the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI was used to create a scene of a collapsing building, allowing the team to complete the sequence ten times faster and at a lower cost than traditional methods would have allowed. This development comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry regarding AI's potential to replace human workers and its use of existing work to generate content. The move was announced as Netflix reported strong quarterly revenue and profit growth.</p>

          <h2>Space Sector Investment Rallies in Second Quarter, Driven by Defense Interest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:50:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investment in the space technology sector saw a significant surge, reaching $3.1 billion in the second quarter, marking a substantial increase from the previous period. This rally is largely attributed to sustained interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment, with U.S. firms capturing 70% of the funding. The report from Seraphim Space highlights that year-to-date investment in U.S. space companies has already surpassed the total for all of 2024. The sector is also seeing new public listings, with companies like Firefly Aerospace filing to go public, indicating robust investor confidence and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, which can detect faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This biomimetic technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, offering significant advantages for military and industrial applications. Infrared sensing is crucial for detecting objects through smoke, fog, or dust. The fire beetle's unique heat-sensing organ evolved for reproductive purposes, as the warmth from wildfires is necessary for its larvae to hatch, providing a powerful model from nature for technological innovation.</p>

          <p>Despite being engaged in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the Hamas attack, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rebounded and is now up over 200% from its low, buoyed by strong foreign investment and renewed confidence after its conflict with Iran. The country's tech sector, which constitutes 20% of its GDP, and a growing defense industry have been key drivers of this economic resilience. The OECD forecasts 4.9% growth for Israel's economy in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a late-night session, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a $9 billion spending cuts package, sending the legislation to President Trump's desk for his signature. The bill, known as a rescissions package, passed 216-213 and will block funds previously allocated for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans celebrated the vote as a victory for fiscal responsibility and a step toward cutting "woke" initiatives. The process was marked by intense debate, with Democrats attempting to force votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which Republicans accused of being a political tactic.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood notion that adults have everything figured out. Instead, he embraces the lesson that most people are simply "winging it" through a continuous process of becoming. He draws parallels to the French comedy show "Bref," whose recent sequel explores the deeper, slower themes of middle age. The author contemplates the gains and losses of an immigrant life, the importance of chosen family, and navigating personal growth in a world facing immense political and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by building and successfully operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. Zhang, who had managed a riverside dock for years, was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to act on his lifelong fascination with invention. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly bought steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black submarine, now glides through the local river, representing a remarkable achievement born from a personal dream and rural ingenuity.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and matching economists' expectations. This easing was partly due to a slight moderation in the rapid increase of rice prices. Despite the slowdown, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, the economic outlook is complicated by potential U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming Upper House election.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have been "free-riders" on U.S. defense spending in the past but stated that they are now committed to increasing their own contributions. In an interview, Merz said that the message from the Trump administration to do more has been heard and that Germany is now significantly boosting its defense budget. This shift is framed by the threat from Russia's war in Ukraine. Merz is also working to strengthen a triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France to create a more independent and capable Europe.</p>
