        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS has secured a legal victory allowing it to continue distributing Sony's 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Jeopardy!' while its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television continues. A Los Angeles judge initially ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but an appellate panel has paused that order pending the appeal. CBS argues that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, while Sony claims CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and underfunded the shows. These game shows remain highly successful despite the decline in traditional TV viewing.</p>

          <p>Amid intensified immigration enforcement in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization. The rise in applications is driven by a desire for protection against deportation and an opportunity to promote civic participation in upcoming congressional elections. Community organizations report a surge in interest since the Trump administration expanded ICE operations. Academics note that this moment presents an opportunity to advance electoral participation and counterbalance President Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever suffered their worst loss of the season to the Washington Mystics in their first game without Caitlin Clark, who is out with a quad injury. The Fever's offense struggled, scoring their lowest point total of the season. Clark, who is averaging 19.0 points, 9.3 assists, and 6.0 rebounds, is expected to miss at least two weeks. DeWanna Bonner led the Fever in scoring with 21 points off the bench, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Mystics' strong performance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the United States through Biden-era programs. The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members, and their relatives. The judge stated that terminating these legal pathways was likely unlawful and could sow discord across the country. The decision is a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups who sued to stop the administration's efforts to strip legal status from various groups.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry due to the H20 export ban. (not investment advice)</p>

Ishiba has pledged to support the U.S. in reviving its shipbuilding industry.</p>

The projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to speed through the planning process. However, they could still be more than a decade away from opening, and overriding local objections can be unpopular. Scientists warn that household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from the south of Scotland, raising hopes that they might nest in the area.

The birds have also been sighted in the North Pennines, the Lake District, and other areas. The population in the south of Scotland has risen to approximately 50, and satellite tagging allows the project to track individual birds.</p>
