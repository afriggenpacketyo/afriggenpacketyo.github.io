          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing, with a cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, following no winners in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This historic accumulation marks the sixth time the Powerball jackpot has surpassed $1 billion in its 33-year history, drawing immense public attention and participation across 45 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The continuous rollover, with no grand prize winner since May 31st, has fueled the prize's growth, significantly boosted by increased ticket sales leading up to each drawing. Despite the daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million, hopeful participants continue to purchase tickets for the Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday drawings, dreaming of life-changing wealth.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite growing economic concerns. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed, though Nidec Corp shares plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also gained on positive household spending data, while South Korea's Kospi saw a modest increase. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 reversed course to fall, reflecting volatile trading conditions. Global bond markets remain under pressure, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% after a court ruling on tariffs, adding to the complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner continued his dominant US Open title defense, sweeping past fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets (6-1, 6-4, 6-2) to reach the semi-finals. Sinner, praised for his consistent and scintillating form, prevented Musetti from converting any of his seven break points while hitting 28 winners on Arthur Ashe Stadium. This victory extends the top seed's remarkable streak to 26 consecutive matches won at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments, showcasing his formidable presence. He is now scheduled to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in Friday's semi-final, as he aims to continue his impressive championship campaign.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that Chinese citizens hold a more nuanced view of their nation's role in global affairs than often perceived by Americans. While optimistic about China's future, economy, and military, nearly half of respondents expressed interest in a shared leadership role, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence with the United States. This perspective suggests potential avenues for reducing US-China tensions, despite ongoing skepticism among the Chinese public about American intentions. However, the survey authors cautioned that some findings might be influenced by self-censorship, reflecting the complexities of public opinion in China.</p>

Jackson consistently denied these allegations, calling them a "political hit job." The Navy confirmed the reinstatement, citing a review of applicable reports and appreciating his distinguished service.

          <p>A long-lost 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his death while escaping in 1940, after which his collection was seized by Hermann Göring. The painting was discovered last month in an online real estate listing, unwittingly uploaded by a daughter of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who escaped to Argentina. This recovery brings a measure of justice to the Goudstikker family and highlights ongoing efforts to repatriate stolen art.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled illegal the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, calling it "a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities." Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard's argument that the freeze was retaliatory, violating First Amendment protections after the university rejected demands for reforms. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars their enforcement, preventing the halt of critical research projects across various fields. While acknowledging Harvard's past issues with antisemitism, the judge concluded that fighting antisemitism was not the administration's "true aim," but rather a pretext for ideological motives.</p>
