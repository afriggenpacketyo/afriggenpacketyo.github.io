          <p>This essay reflects on the brief but impactful career of Ritchie Valens, a foundational figure in rock 'n' roll who died at 17 in a 1959 plane crash. It highlights his innovative ability to blend traditional Mexican sounds with American rock, doo-wop, and soul, creating timeless hits like "Donna" and "La Bamba." The article also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," emphasizing how the film's re-recorded soundtrack by Los Lobos introduced his music to a new generation. Valens' work is credited with paving the way for future Latino artists to achieve mainstream success.</p>

          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu has advanced to the third round of Wimbledon after a commanding win over the 2023 champion, Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu described it as one of her best matches in a long time, a performance that sets up a highly anticipated clash with world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite entering the tournament with tempered expectations due to a difficult grass-court season and a back injury, her confidence appears renewed. Her strong play, particularly her forehand and movement on grass, has positioned her as a formidable opponent in the upcoming high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's influential boxing promoter, Turki Alalshikh, has suggested that former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will come out of retirement for a fight in 2026. Fury, who retired in January after a second loss to Oleksandr Usyk, has also fueled speculation by posting about what 2026 might bring. While Alalshikh hinted at a potential third fight with Usyk in Riyadh, Fury himself expressed a desire for a rematch in England, citing unfairness in his previous bouts. He also mentioned a potential record-breaking fight against fellow British boxer Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium if he decides to return.</p>

          <p>During a visit to a cancer support center, Catherine, Princess of Wales, shared her personal experience with cancer recovery, describing it as a "rollercoaster" with difficult periods. The princess, who announced her cancer diagnosis last year and is now in remission, emphasized the value of support networks for patients after their clinical treatment ends. She noted that while patients often put on a brave face, the recovery phase can be challenging as they are no longer under direct medical care but cannot yet function normally. Kate has been gradually resuming her public duties while focusing on her full recovery.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked President Trump's executive order that effectively banned migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The judge ruled that the president overstepped his authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor existing immigration law grants him the power to bypass legal processes for asylum applications. The administration had justified the ban by declaring illegal immigration an "invasion." The ruling, which has been stayed for two weeks to allow for an appeal, is a significant setback for Trump's restrictive immigration agenda and was praised by civil liberties groups as a protection for those fleeing danger.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the institution will continue after his death, confirming that his reincarnation should be found according to traditional Buddhist practices. Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, he stated the process should be handled by his Gaden Phodrang Trust, signaling that China should not interfere. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese rule and is expected to anger Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next Dalai Lama. This sets the stage for a potential future conflict with two rival Dalai Lamas: one chosen by Tibetan monks and another appointed by China.</p>

In contrast, 23-year-old Sonay Kartal is thriving, reaching the third round after a dominant win, continuing her impressive rise in the world rankings over the past year. Kartal, who largely self-funded her early career, is now set to face French qualifier Diane Parry as she aims to reach the fourth round for the first time.</p>

          <p>A new poll from the University of California, Irvine, indicates that former Vice President Kamala Harris would be the frontrunner for California governor if she decides to enter the race. Harris was the choice of 41% of respondents against an unnamed Republican and led a field of announced candidates with 24% support, despite 40% of voters being undecided. Her high name recognition and favorability ratings give her a significant advantage over other candidates, many of whom remain largely unknown to voters.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a new 10-year plan for England's National Health Service (NHS) aimed at shifting patient care out of hospitals and into local communities. The plan involves creating a network of 200 new neighborhood health hubs staffed by a mix of healthcare professionals, intended to provide more convenient access to services. The goal is for the majority of outpatient care, including scans and follow-up appointments, to occur in these community settings by 2035. While the government says the plan will reduce hospital waiting lists, nursing and doctor unions have raised concerns about staffing and funding for the new services.</p>

          <p>The Griffith Park Pool, a historic Los Angeles landmark built in 1927, will be demolished after being closed since 2020. City officials discovered a severely cracked foundation that was beyond repair, preventing the pool from retaining water. A new $28-million project is planned to replace it with two smaller, modern pools and a splash pad, along with a reconstructed pool house. While local residents have been frustrated by the closure of the popular community resource, the new plan promises a year-round aquatic facility, with construction hoped to begin in summer 2026 and finish by early 2028.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that prevented migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. In his ruling, Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president exceeded his legal authority and cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system." The policy was based on an executive order from January in which President Trump declared the border situation an "invasion." The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal, but the ruling represents a significant legal obstacle to the president's restrictive immigration agenda.</p>
