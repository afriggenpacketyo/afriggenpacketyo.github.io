          <p>Two Caribbean countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Haiti and St. Lucia, sent delegations to a high-level forum in Beijing, indicating a flexible approach by China in engaging with Taiwan's allies. While Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that relations with these countries remain stable, the presence of their representatives at the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum highlights Beijing's ongoing efforts to exert diplomatic pressure. Analysts suggest that this participation doesn't necessarily signal a shift in allegiance, but rather a pragmatic approach to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for a presidential election that will determine the future of the pro-European, center-left government's reform plans. The current president has been blocking the government's initiatives, leading to disappointment among voters. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, who is supported by the opposition Law and Justice party. The outcome will decide whether the government can move forward with its agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing social policies.</p>

The Angels capitalized with two-run performances from Yo√°n Moncada and Nolan Schanuel.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report that raised concerns about his mental acuity. Hur's report, based on interviews conducted in October 2023, noted Biden's memory lapses and described him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." In response, Biden asserted that he knew what he was doing and didn't need Hur's recommendation. The report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, leading to increased scrutiny and eventually, Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.</p>

He also surrounded himself with friendly audiences and used his events to blast Democrats and falsely claim he won the 2020 election.
