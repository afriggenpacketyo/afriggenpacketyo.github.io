          <h2>Details of UK-US Tariff Agreement Revealed</h2>

          <p>The US and the UK have reached a tariff deal on some goods, but a blanket 10% tariff on most UK goods entering the US remains. The agreement cuts tariffs on UK exports like cars, steel, and aluminum, but is not a full free-trade agreement as US President Trump lacks the authority to sign such an agreement without Congress approval. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while steel and aluminum tariffs are scrapped, benefitting firms like British Steel. Negotiations will continue on pharmaceuticals and digital services tax, with the UK and US agreeing to work on a digital trade deal. There are no changes to food standards as of yet, and the article does not mention whether the UK will drop its 10% tariff on US cars.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has secured a trade agreement with the United States by cultivating a relationship with President Trump. The agreement, the first between the US and another country since Trump imposed tariffs, is a political victory for Starmer, who has avoided criticizing Trump and acted as a bridge between Europe and the US. The article notes Britain had other advantages in dealing with the United States. The deal could help buoy Britain's economy but also presents hurdles, including to efforts to reset trade relations with the European Union after Brexit.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, motivated by global challenges and Andrew Carnegie's views on wealth. The Gates Foundation, founded with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, has already given away over $100 billion and will close at the end of 2045 after Gates gives away virtually all of his wealth. Despite the increase, Gates notes that philanthropists cannot cover the multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by wealthy countries. He wrote that it is unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, buoyed by news of a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and the UK. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its status as a "bouncebackability asset" amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Antoni Trenchev of crypto exchange Nexo notes that Bitcoin is supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and demand from spot-ETF investors. The article suggests that Bitcoin's resilience will be tested further in an uncertain global environment, citing rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to cutting rates.</p>

The task force, in collaboration with member states, is analyzing customs data and shipping records to monitor potential changes in trade flows. The EU is focusing on sectors with industrial overcapacity and a high risk of dumping, and is prepared to use rapid-fire safeguarding measures, including import quotas and high import duties, to protect its industries from the second-order impacts of Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Shopify's stock slipped after the company reported mixed first-quarter results and issued soft guidance for the current period, with CFO Jeff Hoffmeister noting tariff uncertainty. Shopify expects gross profit and revenue to grow at a slower pace than analysts had anticipated. The company has some exposure to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, but the expiration of de minimis is not expected to have a "meaningful impact" in the near term. Hoffmeister said consumers who purchase from Shopify businesses skew higher income, with more than half of buyers in the U.S. having incomes above $100,000.</p>

The author proposes cultivating a "quiet ego," defined as a self-identity that incorporates others without losing the self, characterized by charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope. The author provides strategies for acquiring these virtues, including asking what others need that only you can provide, seeking improvements in your environment, questioning your own assumptions, and detaching from your emotions.</p>

          <p>A woman accused of having an illegal abortion has been cleared by a jury. Nicola Packer, 45, cried as she was acquitted of "unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing" with the "intent to procure a miscarriage". Isleworth Crown Court heard she took abortion medicine at home during a coronavirus lockdown, in November 2020, when she was about 26 weeks pregnant. The legal limit for taking medication at home to terminate a pregnancy is 10 weeks, while the outer limit for abortions in England, Scotland and Wales is 24 weeks, apart from in certain circumstances.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates plans to give away most of his fortune by 2045, accelerating his charitable giving through his foundation. The Microsoft co-founder said his foundation has already given $100 billion and expects to spend another $200 billion over the next two decades. Gates cited Andrew Carnegie's views on the duty of wealthy people to return their fortunes to society. Gates criticized the US, UK and France for cutting their foreign aid budgets and accused Elon Musk of being responsible for the deaths of children through his cuts to the US aid budget.</p>
