          <p>Apple supplier Foxconn has been granted approval by the Indian government to establish a $433 million chip manufacturing joint venture with HCL Group. The plant, located in Uttar Pradesh, is projected to be operational by 2027 and will produce display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and other electronics. This deal aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift toward India, seeking alternatives to China amid ongoing trade tensions. The facility is expected to produce up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million display driver chips monthly, significantly boosting India's semiconductor industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy demonstrated stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. This period precedes the implementation of US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes in April, raising concerns about the sustainability of this growth rate. Business investment saw a nearly 6% increase, and the service sector performed well, suggesting robust economic drivers beyond just manufacturers selling to the US ahead of tariffs.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul announced that Germany is willing to align with US President Trump's call for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. This statement was made during a NATO foreign ministers' gathering in Turkey, where Wadephul emphasized Berlin's acceptance of the 5% target in principle. The current NATO commitment is at least 2% of GDP, a target that many member states still fail to meet.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in response to near-record high rice prices. This move involves releasing 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned. The decision comes amid concerns about potential hoarding by wholesalers and farmers anticipating further price increases. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements to encourage greater participation in auctions, addressing a shortfall in rice distribution following high temperatures in 2023 and increased consumption due to tourism.</p>

The discovery underscores the document's significance in the evolution of Western notions of rights and freedoms. The Magna Carta, originally issued in 1215, represents a cornerstone of constitutional history and limits the power of the monarch.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced significant growth due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. Despite potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry, the IMF expects limited impact on Denmark because most of its drug products are neither produced nor pass through the country. The economy is expected to moderate in the coming years, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system where most value is in intellectual property.</p>

Harvard obtained the document in the 1940s for just $27.50, the equivalent of just over $470 (‚Ç¨420) today, according to a US Department of Labor inflation calculator. The new insights on the document come as Harvard University has been barred from receiving new federal grants by the Trump administration, which many critics see as violating some of the key principles enshrined in the Magna Carta.</p>
