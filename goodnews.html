          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the approximately $527 million financial penalty against President Trump and his co-defendants in his civil fraud case, ruling the fine was "excessive" and violated the Eighth Amendment. While the monetary judgment was vacated, the court upheld other sanctions, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation. New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced her office will appeal the decision to the state's highest court, emphasizing the ruling still found that the president violated the law.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is beginning to move away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions and dangerous surf to the Outer Banks. While the Category 2 storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., storm surge warnings remain in effect, and authorities continue to caution against swimming along most of the East Coast due to life-threatening rip currents. The storm's path is forecast to take it between the U.S. and Bermuda before it weakens and becomes post-tropical by the weekend.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has launched a new drone delivery service called "Zipotle" in the Dallas area, in partnership with logistics provider Zipline. The service uses small, autonomous aircraft to deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes, aiming to provide faster and fresher food. Initially available to a limited number of customers, the drones can carry orders up to 5.5 pounds and deliver them by hovering at 300 feet and gently lowering the package. This initiative represents a significant step into automated aerial delivery for the fast-casual restaurant chain.</p>

          <p>The Trent Rockets secured a six-wicket victory over the Oval Invincibles, keeping their slim qualification hopes alive in The Hundred women's cricket tournament. Despite a mid-innings wobble while chasing a target of 110, Heather Graham's unbeaten 19 runs helped guide the Rockets to their target with 16 balls remaining. The Invincibles' innings was hampered by a slow start and the loss of key wickets at crucial moments, with Meg Lanning's 45 being the standout performance. Both teams must now win all their remaining games to have a chance at advancing.</p>

          <p>The draw for the 2025 US Open has been announced, with British number one Jack Draper and top female player Emma Raducanu both set to face qualifiers in their opening matches. Draper, who had a breakout run to the semi-finals last year, is in a bracket that could see him face world number one Jannik Sinner in the quarter-finals. Raducanu, returning to the site of her 2021 title victory, could potentially meet 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the third round. Other British players, including Katie Boulter and Cameron Norrie, have also learned their first-round opponents.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Piece Imagines Donald Trump's Ideal 'Woke-Free' Museum</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 12:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical article, written from the perspective of Donald Trump, critiques modern museums for focusing on what he terms "WOKE" topics like slavery and past injustices rather than success and the future. In a humorous and exaggerated tone, the piece imagines a perfect museum filled with future-oriented, fictional objects like hoverboards, lightsabers, and live dinosaurs, while completely avoiding historical introspection. The parody suggests the ideal museum experience would be more akin to an Apple Store, emphasizing brightness, positive reinforcement, and a complete lack of critical engagement with the past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) remain historically attractive, offering a stable investment option with fixed returns. A $25,000 deposit could yield returns ranging from approximately $269 for a 3-month term at 4.30% to over $5,250 for a 5-year term at 4.20%. Unlike savings accounts with variable rates, CDs lock in a rate for the entire term, providing predictable growth for savers who do not need immediate access to their funds.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 12:03:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July, contrary to analyst expectations of a decline, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. The rise is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This photo essay delves into the varied and complex lives of parents after their children have left home, a phase commonly known as the "empty nest." Through intimate portraits and interviews with 14 individuals and couples in Los Angeles County, the project reveals that this transition is not a singular experience of loss. For some, it is a period of rediscovery and freedom, while for others it brings loneliness or is complicated by children who return home. The stories highlight that the term "empty" often fails to capture the rich emotional landscape of grief, relief, and reinvention that defines this stage of life.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'Moral Offsetting' for Meat Consumption Through Charitable Donations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new philanthropic trend, termed "moral offsetting," suggests that individuals who feel guilty about eating meat can donate to anti-factory farming charities as an alternative to changing their diet. This concept, likened to carbon offsets, was popularized by a recent successful fundraiser that raised over $2 million for the cause. Proponents argue it's a pragmatic way to fund a resource-poor movement, given that few people are willing to go vegan. However, critics worry it may absolve consumers of personal responsibility and reinforce the low value placed on the lives of farmed animals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines five key teachings from the Baha'i faith that offer a framework for achieving a happier life, applicable to people of any belief system. These lessons include having faith in the future, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth, and seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting physical pleasures. The teachings also emphasize that true well-being comes from making others happy and adhering to timeless virtues rather than chasing novel trends. The author notes that these principles are consistent with findings from social science on post-traumatic growth and the psychological benefits of altruism.</p>
