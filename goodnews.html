          <p>Despite a strong month for stocks in May, investors are showing skepticism about the U.S. equities market, according to exchange-traded fund flows. Inflows into equity ETFs have decreased by more than half since the market recovered from April losses, suggesting underlying fears remain due to trade uncertainty and tariff battles. Investors are largely moving their money into ultra-short duration bonds, indicating a cautious stance on U.S. equities. While retail investors with a long-term focus have continued buying U.S. stocks, interest in tech ETFs and cyclical stocks has waned, with income-producing equities becoming less attractive due to rising bond yields.

          <p>Reality TV star Kristin Cavallari has described her decision to cut her father out of her life as "the best decision I've ever made," citing a significant weight lifted from her. She explained that the decision came after years of feeling uncomfortable around her father, who she says constantly put her down as a child and crossed boundaries with her children. Cavallari shared that she had been wanting to distance herself for a long time and that it wasn't until he "crossed the boundary with my kids" and wouldn't apologize that she pulled the trigger. She emphasized the importance of removing people who bring hurt and sadness from one's life, even if they are parents.</p>

O'Leary advises individuals to track their income and spending over a 90-day period to identify overspending and debt accumulation.

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act is facing opposition from Senate Republicans, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, who are concerned about its impact on the national debt. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by more than $1.5 trillion, it is projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt. These senators are pushing for deeper cuts than those in the House-passed bill, potentially complicating its passage in the Senate, where Republicans can only afford three defections. The White House defends the bill, citing its potential to save $1.6 trillion over 10 years, and accuses scorekeepers of using "shoddy assumptions."</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida divers who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. The men believed the longline was illegal and freed the animals before reporting the incident to state wildlife officials, but federal prosecutors argued the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase the convictions, allowing the men to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S.</p>

The ruling, made by a Trump appointee, is the latest to limit the administration's practice of rapidly deporting people accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The judge ruled that the government hasn't provided adequate notice for individuals to challenge their deportation. The Supreme Court has also weighed in, stating that people need a chance to challenge their deportation under the law.</p>

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs. The agreement establishes the price that will be paid for delivering water supplies, ending years of disputes in court.

The dispute was largely about the price the Water Authority pays MWD for an exchange of water, and the settlement provides greater fiscal certainty and new opportunities to move water to communities that need it most.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that the closures would severely hamper USDA‚Äôs ability to support farmers, who rely on these offices for loans, grants, and technical assistance. The original closure plans were part of broader efforts to reduce government spending, but the reversal ensures continued access to essential resources for California's agricultural sector. The agency supports optimizing building capacity and consolidating underutilized offices to reduce inefficiencies, while continuing to prioritize frontline services for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.</p>
