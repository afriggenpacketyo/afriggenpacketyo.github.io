          <p>Chicago Cubs rookie Matt Shaw had a standout game against the New York Mets, shortly after facing criticism from Mets broadcasters for attending the memorial service of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. Shaw, who was friends with Kirk, defended his decision to attend the service by citing the importance of his Christian faith. In the subsequent game, he went 3-for-4 with a home run, contributing significantly to the Cubs' 10-3 victory. The announcers had previously called his choice to leave the team during a playoff race "weird" and "unprecedented," sparking a debate among sports commentators.</p>

          <p>Apple's latest operating system, iOS 26, includes new features aimed at reducing the overwhelming volume of spam calls and texts that have made many users hesitant to answer their phones. A new AI-powered call screening feature, which is off by default, has Siri interact with unknown callers to determine their identity and purpose before the phone rings. Additionally, an enhanced text filtering system automatically sorts messages into categories like "Known Senders," "Unknown Senders," and "Spam," similar to an email inbox. While these tools offer more user control, they also add complexity and may not be a complete solution to the pervasive issue of scam communications.</p>

Manager Pep Guardiola brought the two academy graduates onto the pitch in the second half of the 2-0 victory. Jaden, 19, is a midfielder, while Reigan, 17, is a winger; both have been with City's youth setup since the age of eight. The event was celebrated by fans and highlighted the club's commitment to developing young talent from its academy system.</p>

          <h2>Education Researcher Argues AI Has Not Increased Overall Cheating Rates in Schools</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 06:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern that generative AI is fueling a crisis of academic dishonesty, an education researcher argues that the data tells a more nuanced story. Citing studies conducted before and after the release of ChatGPT, the article suggests that while AI has become a new method for cheating, overall rates of academic misconduct have not significantly increased from already high historical levels. The research indicates that a small percentage of students use AI to complete entire assignments, but many more use it for tasks like generating ideas or improving their writing. The author suggests the focus should be on understanding why students cheat and adapting educational practices for an AI-integrated world.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to provide customers with more transparent information about ticket prices. The inquiry was launched after fans complained about unclear and escalating costs for the Oasis reunion tour, where a tiered pricing system led to confusion. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," it determined the company may have misled consumers. Ticketmaster will now have to disclose 24 hours in advance if tiered pricing is used and provide more detailed price information to fans waiting in online queues.</p>

          <h2>New York Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani Uses FIFA Ticket Prices to Promote Affordability Agenda</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is leveraging the issue of high FIFA World Cup ticket prices to connect with voters and advance his progressive platform focused on affordability. He recently launched a petition demanding a price cap on resale tickets for the 2026 World Cup matches in the New York area, aligning the issue with his broader campaign promises like rent freezes and free public transit. This move is seen as a shrewd political strategy to engage a younger, progressive-leaning demographic through the popular appeal of soccer. The article suggests this approach could serve as a blueprint for left-leaning politicians to re-engage with sports, a domain often utilized more effectively by the political right.</p>

          <p>As part of the California Climate Credit program, millions of residents will see a significant reduction on their October electricity bills. The credit, which can be over $50 for customers of major utilities like PG&E and Southern California Edison, is derived from the state's cap-and-invest program. This system requires large industrial polluters to purchase allowances for their greenhouse gas emissions, with a portion of the revenue returned directly to ratepayers twice a year. The program is set to be extended through 2045, with officials anticipating that the credit amounts will increase in the coming years.</p>

          <h2>The Concept of 'Lavender Marriages' Evolves from Historical Necessity to Modern Social Trend</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "lavender marriage," historically used to describe marriages of convenience that allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to hide their orientation in repressive societies, is being repurposed by a younger generation on platforms like TikTok. Originally a survival tactic in places like early 20th-century Hollywood, these unions provided a heteronormative cover. Today, some young people are using the term to describe platonic partnerships aimed at achieving financial stability, companionship, and shared domestic life without the pressures of romantic or sexual expectations. While this modern trend reflects shifting views on relationships, some critics argue it overlooks the painful history of oppression that made such arrangements necessary.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Eight Safety Tips for Pedestrians and Cyclists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising traffic fatalities involving pedestrians and cyclists, transportation safety experts are emphasizing the importance of "defensive walking and cycling." Key recommendations include being highly visible, especially at night, by using lights and walking against traffic if no sidewalk is available. It is also crucial to be predictable, use designated crossings, and avoid distractions like headphones or phones. Experts advise looking in all directions, including behind, before crossing an intersection, as turning vehicles pose a significant hazard. Ultimately, the advice stresses that while drivers have a responsibility, individuals must take ownership of their own safety on the road.</p>
