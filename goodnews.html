          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon for approximately 20 seconds, resulting in two commercial jets aborting landings at Reagan National Airport. The incident occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement, which affected communication as the helicopter approached the Pentagon. An Army official said there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic. The FAA declined to comment on the incident, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>

He argues that as the United States becomes more focused on its own interests, AI could become a bargaining chip, making it crucial for Japan to develop its own defense-related AI solutions. Japan's Defense Ministry has already outlined basic policies for AI use in defense, but concerns remain about credibility and misuse.</p>

          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarket operators are boosting sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, following similar moves by Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. The decision reflects consumer interest in cheaper alternatives due to rising prices and supply concerns, with the hope that increased choice will boost overall rice consumption. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed the sale of U.S.-grown rice as "historic" for American farmers and timely for Japanese consumers facing food price concerns.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States increasingly recognizes Japan's economic importance after holding trade talks with U.S. officials. Akazawa emphasized the significance of economic security issues, like supply chains, in the discussions and urged the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan. The talks coincided with the approval of Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, signaling a potential shift in U.S. attitudes towards Japanese investment. While Japan seeks the elimination of all additional tariffs, compromises may be necessary to secure an early agreement.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. The move aims to address rising rice prices that have impacted households amid broader inflation. The government intends to begin procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons from its reserves. It is uncertain whether this measure will lead to an overall drop in rice prices, given the limited amount of reserves.</p>
