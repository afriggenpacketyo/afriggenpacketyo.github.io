          <p>Kim Kardashian testified in a Paris court regarding the 2016 armed robbery in which $10 million worth of jewelry was stolen from her. Kardashian recounted being tied up and held at gunpoint, fearing for her life during the intrusion, and her friend Simone Harouche testified about hearing Kardashian pleading for her life during the attack. Ten individuals face charges including robbery and kidnapping, with some admitting involvement in the heist. The robbers, dubbed "the Grandpa robbers" due to their age, remain largely at large, and the jewelry has not been recovered.</p>

          <p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has proposed expanding trade cooperation with Latin American countries beyond commodities, focusing on emerging areas like clean energy, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Speaking in Beijing, Xi emphasized China's role as a reliable partner amidst global turbulence and protectionism, indirectly referencing tariff threats from the Trump administration. The announcement follows a provisional reduction of tariffs between China and the United States, and Xi's remarks signal China's intent to strengthen ties with Latin America as a countermeasure to U.S. influence in the region. The article notes potential competition with Elon Musk's Starlink through a proposed Brazil-China partnership to launch low-orbit satellites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) voted to void David Hogg's election as vice chair, citing a procedural challenge, although the vote follows internal criticism of Hogg's plans to primary older Democratic lawmakers. Hogg stated the DNC has pledged to remove him, viewing the vote as a fast track to that effort. The decision to potentially remove Hogg comes after he announced plans to spend $20 million to primary older Democratic lawmakers in blue districts to make room for new Democratic leaders. Hogg's strategy sparked controversy, with some criticizing it as divisive and prioritizing internal conflict over defeating Republicans.</p>

          <p>India's headline inflation rate slowed to 3.16% in April, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline. The reading was lower than March's data of 3.34% and below economists' expectations. Food inflation, a key metric in the country, also dipped to 1.78% in April. Analysts suggest that while food prices will remain stable, core inflation may rise due to increased gold prices, which have surged amid global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car.

Counter-terrorism police are leading the inquiry, treating the fires as suspicious, though Starmer no longer lives at the Kentish Town home, which is currently rented out.</p>

The antiquities, spanning centuries of Egyptian civilization, were recovered through a three-year effort involving Egypt's consulate in New York, the New York District Attorney's Office, and U.S. security agencies. The collection also includes jewelry, a granite foot fragment, ivory and stone figurines, and a gold coin dating back to the reign of Ptolemy I. The artifacts were seized in separate investigations beginning in 2022 and held at Egypt's consulate in New York until their return to Cairo.</p>

          <p>Despite significant government investment and efforts to reshore manufacturing, American manufacturers are struggling to fill open positions. There are nearly half a million open manufacturing jobs, and companies cite recruiting and retaining workers as their top challenge. Factors contributing to this shortage include a tight labor market, the need for specific skills, an aging workforce, and outdated perceptions of manufacturing jobs. Some argue that higher wages are necessary to attract workers, while others emphasize the need for better training and apprenticeship programs to address the skills gap.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used executive powers to order sweeping cuts to prescription drug prices in the U.S., aiming to align them with prices in other developed countries. The order directs the health secretary to negotiate price reductions with pharmaceutical companies, potentially targeting slimming drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. While the plan has faced skepticism and legal challenges in the past, it keeps pressure on pharmacy benefits managers and aims to allow drugmakers to sell directly to patients. The pharmaceutical industry is likely to resist the changes, warning of potential impacts on investment in research and development.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Happiest Place On Earth," unearths early maps and designs of Disneyland, revealing discarded ideas and the evolution of the park's core concepts. The book traces the development of Disneyland from early ideas of placing the park next to the studio in Burbank to gradual advancements of the theme-park form. Some of the early explorations included uranium hunting and an early design for Main Street. A few maps have been shown before but a lot of these have not been seen before.</p>

          <h2>California's Homelessness Policy Reconsidered</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is reconsidering its "housing first" policy to allow funding of sober living homes, amid growing evidence that many homeless individuals prefer sober environments. Assemblyman Matt Haney is pushing legislation to amend the policy, allowing local jurisdictions to channel up to a fourth of their state homelessness funds to residential programs that practice sobriety. While some support the change, others express concern about chronic complaints about bad operators who abuse insurance or summarily evict residents who relapse. The bill requires the state Department of Health Care Services to establish certification of recovery homes and adopt standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trip to the Middle East promises to be filled with pageantry and purchases, with Saudi Arabia vowing to invest about $600 billion over the four years of Trump‚Äôs presidency. Trump is bringing business leaders for a Saudi-U.S. business summit, and the UAE has pledged $1.4 trillion in U.S. investment packages over the next decade. Qatar is in discussions about the ‚Äúpossible transfer‚Äù of a luxury Boeing 747-8 to replace Air Force One. Israel is watching the visit with consternation, expecting Trump to hear an earful from Arab governments on its continuing conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza and the role Israel is playing in the future of Syria.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump's border security policies, there's a push to allow more workers from abroad to address labor shortages. Business advocate Bob Worsley argues that a secure workforce is as crucial as a secure border and suggests bigger legal avenues for immigration. Worsley, a Republican, emphasizes the economic benefits of immigration, particularly for industries like hospitality, construction, and agriculture. He hopes that with the border secured, Trump will focus on fixing the dysfunctional immigration system.</p>
