          <p>In a recent interview, Victoria Beckham described her family as more traditional than people might realize, emphasizing the importance of shared family time and supporting one another's endeavors. She explained that she prioritized being present for family dinners even when it meant returning to work afterward and believes it's healthy for her children to see both parents dedicated to their careers. The article also touches upon persistent rumors of a rift between the family and their eldest son, Brooklyn, and his wife, Nicola Peltz, which the family has previously downplayed.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new technique that has successfully analyzed old biological samples, including cancer tissues that were stored for nearly a decade in suboptimal conditions. This breakthrough could potentially allow for the study of historically significant but chemically damaged specimens, which were previously considered too degraded for detailed analysis. Co-corresponding author Li Yang of BGI-Research even speculated that, with this technology, an attempt could be made to analyze Albert Einstein's preserved brain, though acknowledging the significant challenges involved.</p>

The acquisition comes after Pfizer's own obesity drug candidates faced significant setbacks, and it provides the pharmaceutical giant with access to Metsera's promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments. This strategic move is expected to accelerate Pfizer's entry into a market dominated by competitors like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Recent Trump-Xi Call Suggests a Shift Towards Managed Rivalry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that a recent phone call between Presidents Trump and Xi signals an emerging phase of "managed rivalry" between the U.S. and China. Despite ongoing strategic competition and fears of escalating conflict, the pragmatic and constructive tone of the conversation suggests both nations are accepting a degree of mutual dependence. The author posits that this shift is driven by the reality that all-out economic conflict would be mutually devastating, necessitating a framework of cautious competition and accommodation that is essential for global stability.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has pardoned Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian activist and political prisoner. Abd el-Fattah, who has spent most of the last decade imprisoned for his activism, became a symbol of opposition to the government's crackdown on dissent. His release follows years of international campaigns and repeated hunger strikes that drew global attention, particularly during the COP27 climate summit hosted by Egypt. His family, well-known activists themselves, had lobbied extensively for his freedom, including meeting with the British Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>A new mutual defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is unlikely to disrupt Riyadh's significant energy relationship with India, a key crude oil consumer and regional rival of Pakistan. A source familiar with the matter stated that India would continue to buy Saudi oil, explaining that Riyadh is diversifying its security alliances without compromising crucial commercial ties. The source also dismissed speculation about Saudi Arabia moving away from the U.S. dollar for oil trading, reinforcing the greenback's foundational role in its exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the enduring popularity of the self-help industry, a market valued at over $45 billion that encompasses books, courses, and digital content. Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro notes that while the genre has evolved to include more research-backed authors like Brené Brown, its core appeal remains the promise of self-betterment. However, the article questions whether the intense focus on individual optimization and productivity is healthy, suggesting that it may lead to isolation by neglecting the crucial role of community and interpersonal relationships in personal well-being.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid downplayed a second consecutive week of sideline confrontations with tight end Travis Kelce, stating that he loves his player's passion. During the Chiefs' victory over the Giants, Reid and Kelce were seen in a heated exchange, similar to an incident the previous week. Reid suggested the team needed more of that emotional energy and praised Kelce's all-in attitude, noting his own role is sometimes to be the "policeman." Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also affirmed the strong relationship between the coach and star player.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging President Donald Trump to support an international proposal to raise the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. In a letter, Cruz argued that the current policy forces thousands of experienced pilots into early retirement annually and that the U.S. should lead the effort for the change at an upcoming UN aviation meeting. The proposal is opposed by the Air Line Pilots Association, which cites health risks and potential cognitive decline in older pilots as safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the long-held narrative that marriage and two-parent households are the primary solution to racial inequality. Her research reveals that Black children raised in two-parent families still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts in education and employment outcomes. The book argues that this is due to persistent structural racism and vast disparities in wealth and resources, suggesting that policy focus should shift from marriage promotion to addressing these deeper systemic issues.</p>

Most importantly, Williams was not sacked once, a significant improvement for a quarterback who was the third-most sacked in NFL history last season.</p>
