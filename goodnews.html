        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, credit card interest rates continue to climb, reaching the highest levels since December. The average annual percentage rate (APR) is now just over 20%, with new cards averaging 24.3%. Experts suggest this trend is due to card issuers mitigating their exposure against borrowers who may default, along with increased consumer demand for credit amid economic uncertainty. Consumers carrying a balance from month to month are most affected by these high APRs, as they only kick in for new loans and not old debts; even an eventual Fed rate cut may not provide much relief.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing low student loan rates for the fall of 2025 requires preparation and comparison, starting with maximizing federal funding options by completing the FAFSA. Private lenders offer various student loan products, so comparing APRs, fees, and repayment terms is essential. Optimizing one's credit profile, using a cosigner, and taking advantage of rate discounts can further lower rates. Considering shorter repayment terms can also lead to lower rates, but it is important to balance this with affordability.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers in the United Kingdom have taken a significant step towards legalizing assisted dying, with Parliament approving a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales to end their lives. The bill permits individuals aged 18 or older with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval from two doctors and a review panel. Supporters argue that it provides a compassionate choice for those suffering, while critics fear potential pressure on vulnerable individuals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing a new national priority voucher plan to expedite drug reviews for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." The plan aims to cut review times to one to two months by allowing companies to submit drug applications before final clinical trial results. In the program's first year, the FDA will give vouchers to companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While this move is seen as positive for the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the risks of speeding up drug reviews and potential political influence.</p>

          <p>The assisted dying bill, which would legalize assisted dying in some circumstances in England and Wales, has cleared all of its initial stages in the House of Commons. It now has to go through all the stages it went through in the Commons in the House of Lords. Supporters of the bill feel there's a majority in favor in the Lords, but until peers actually vote, that's just an informed guess. One of the biggest worries, for supporters of assisted dying, is that the Bill could run out of time.</p>

          <p>Today's vote on assisted dying is hugely significant, as it now looks highly likely that assisted dying will be introduced in England and Wales. The vote by MPs to approve Kim Leadbeater's bill is arguably the biggest vote regarding bodily autonomy since the legalisation of abortion in Great Britain in 1967. The Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill will now go to the Lords, where it is likely to spend several months undergoing the same line-by-line scrutiny that it did before MPs. Under the proposals, mentally competent, terminally ill adults in England and Wales with a life expectancy of less than six months would be eligible for an assisted death.</p>

          <p>A court case against England goalkeeper Khiara Keating has been dropped nearly a year after she pleaded not guilty to possessing canisters of nitrous oxide. The 20-year-old Manchester City goalkeeper was charged with possession of a Class C drug on 18 June last year after an investigation by Greater Manchester Police. Greater Manchester Police has confirmed the case has been discontinued. Keating said she's relieved the charges have been dropped and is looking forward to focusing fully on the Euros and spending time with her family.</p>
