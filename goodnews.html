          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, is defending his proposal to open five city-operated grocery stores, one in each borough. He asserts that the plan is not meant to oppose private grocery and bodega owners but to create a "public option" that can increase competition and lower food prices for New Yorkers. Mamdani envisions a partnership with existing store owners, helping them with issues like rent and insurance, while addressing food affordability. The proposal has drawn criticism from business owners and economists who fear it represents a move toward socialism.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has reached an agreement to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a deal that could be worth up to a club-record £42.5 million. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London. Ouattara reportedly sought a move after not having a prominent role at Bournemouth, where he scored nine goals in 37 appearances last season. The signing comes after Brentford's previous bid for another winger, Omari Hutchinson, was rejected by Ipswich.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major cities, smaller county-level markets are becoming a crucial engine for consumption. Residents in these lower-tier areas often have lighter financial burdens and greater confidence, leading to stronger purchasing power and a willingness to spend on items like imported goods and electric vehicles. Experts suggest this "consumption upgrade" in previously overlooked regions is vital for China's goal of shifting toward a consumption-driven economy. This trend highlights a significant, untapped potential within the country's vast domestic market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down two directives from the Trump administration that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and universities. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI programs. The ruling found that the administration's guidance, which framed DEI as discriminatory, constituted a "sea change" in regulation that was implemented without following proper procedures, thereby chilling constitutionally protected speech among educators.</p>

          <p>While the consumer rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model was met with criticism, it is finding significant success in the enterprise sector, its primary target market. Startups and major companies like Box are adopting GPT-5 for its speed, lower cost, and improved performance on complex tasks like coding and logical reasoning, challenging rival Anthropic's dominance. OpenAI has expanded its enterprise sales team to capitalize on this demand, aiming to build a sustainable business by locking in corporate customers.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reversed its decision to use expedited removal proceedings against Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a Guatemalan woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Her lawyers successfully argued in a lawsuit that fast-tracking her deportation without a court hearing was illegal, as such procedures are reserved for immigrants with less than two years of U.S. residency. The case raised concerns that the Trump administration was attempting to expand its authority to speed up deportations, but the government ultimately moved her to regular proceedings.</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares worth about $1.6 billion. The move is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has struggled this year amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The investment aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's shares saw a significant jump in after-hours trading.

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive approach to treatment. Under the new advice, medication is now recommended for individuals with systolic pressure in the 130-139 range if lifestyle changes alone are not effective after three to six months. The guidelines also shift from recommending moderate alcohol consumption to suggesting complete abstinence due to evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. The changes emphasize early intervention to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia.</p>

The move would represent another instance of the U.S. government taking direct equity stakes in key industries to advance national security and economic priorities. (not investment advice)</p>
