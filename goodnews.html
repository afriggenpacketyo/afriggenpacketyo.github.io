This gift represents the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution. The funds are intended to advance a revolutionary approach to cancer research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, building on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising. The donation underscores the Knights' extensive history of philanthropy, with their lifetime giving estimated in the billions of dollars.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:38:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation soaring past $430 billion. A key driver of this growth has been significant government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which now account for over half of its revenue. Despite its massive valuation, Palantir's revenue remains a fraction of other tech giants, leading to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280, indicating investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its AI-powered tools.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2018, boys in the UK have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, with boys at 28.4% compared to girls' 28.2%. This narrow but significant reversal is partly attributed to the growing popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are studied by a higher proportion of boys. Maths, the most popular A-level for the 12th consecutive year, awards a significantly higher percentage of top grades compared to other subjects. Meanwhile, humanities and arts subjects have seen a continued decline in popularity among students.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for her invention of a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless people stay warm. She conceived the idea at age 12, and engineering firm Thales later developed it into a working prototype, with units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. The honor, a partnership with Lego, also saw Rebecca immortalized as a mini-figure. She expressed shock and honor at the recognition, hoping her story encourages other young girls to pursue their ideas in STEM fields.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and placed its police under federal supervision, legal experts suggest such a move would be much harder to execute in other cities. Washington, D.C.'s unique status as a federal district gives the president direct authority over its National Guard and the ability to control local police in emergencies. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard units, and federal law largely prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. This legal framework presents a significant obstacle to Trump's threats of similar interventions in cities like Chicago or Los Angeles.</p>

          <h2>The Atlantic Explores the Evolving, Centuries-Old Definition of 'Genius'</h2>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic's archives delves into the historical quest to define "genius," a concept that has shifted dramatically over centuries. The term originally referred to a person's guiding spirit but evolved in the 19th century into a label for extraordinary, almost magical talent in individuals like chess prodigy Paul Morphy. The piece explores how the rise of genetics and the problematic theories of eugenics, pioneered by Francis Galton, attempted to scientifically classify and even breed genius. Ultimately, the article concludes that genius is not just a matter of heritable traits but is also profoundly shaped by social conditions, luck, and timing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Military Academy at West Point has honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Wang, who had dreamed of attending West Point, was posthumously accepted into the class of 2025 and has now been named an honorary graduate. He died a hero, holding a door open to help his classmates escape the gunman. The recognition came after his fellow cadets nominated him for the honor, ensuring his story of selfless sacrifice will be part of their class's shared identity as they begin their service as Army officers.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion piece praises a new Department of Energy climate report for taking a nuanced position on climate change. The author argues the report is revolutionary for affirming that humans contribute to warming while also concluding it may not be an impending catastrophe and that drastic reduction policies could cause more economic harm than good. The report, created by a small group of independent scientists, found no convincing evidence of increased frequency or intensity of U.S. hurricanes or droughts. The author hopes this report will encourage more open debate, moving climate policy away from dogma and fear.</p>

          <p>The two leading plant-based meat companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are taking different paths to navigate a stagnant market and address consumer criticism. Beyond is rebranding, simplifying its name to "Beyond" and launching new products with simpler, "cleaner" ingredient lists to counter claims that its food is overly processed. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on mimicking meat, launching more "indulgent" products and emphasizing a "meatier brand identity," betting that taste remains the single most important factor for consumers. The success of these divergent strategies could shape the future of the alternative protein industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following criticism from residents and a funeral director who labeled it a "fat tax." The plan would have imposed a 20% surcharge for a 6-foot-wide plot compared to a standard 5-foot one. The council initially defended the move by citing increased demand and the costs of accommodating larger coffins, a practice already in place in other UK councils. However, after a BBC investigation highlighted public opposition, the council announced it would not proceed with the plans.</p>

          <p>Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of insurer Aviva, has strongly reiterated the company's commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite growing political pushback in the US and UK. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the insurance business, citing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. The statement comes as Aviva's profits and share price rise, and as several major U.S. and UK banks have withdrawn from the UN-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, creating a schism in the financial industry over green commitments.</p>
