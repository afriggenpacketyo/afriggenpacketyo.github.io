        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is exploring the implementation of a digital ID system to help address illegal immigration. He suggested that such a program could serve as an important tool to reduce the incentive for entering the country without permission. Starmer noted that public perception has likely evolved since the contentious debate over physical ID cards two decades ago, given the increased prevalence of digital identification today. The Conservative opposition, however, expressed skepticism, arguing that a digital ID system would not solve the core issues of illegal migration and employment.</p>

He explained that he is a junior, sharing the name with his father, Denzel Hayes Washington Sr. To avoid confusion when she called for "Denzle," his mother began referring to him as "Den-zelle," and the pronunciation stuck. The actor shared the anecdote while discussing his lifelong fandom of the Dallas Cowboys and the rise in popularity of his name after his career took off.</p>

          <p>The US Open semifinals will feature a compelling match between Naomi Osaka and Amanda Anisimova, both of whom are making remarkable comebacks after taking breaks from tennis for mental health reasons. Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, returned to the sport this year after maternity leave and has fought her way back up the rankings. Anisimova, who took an eight-month hiatus citing burnout, recently defeated the world No. 2 player to advance. Their match represents a significant milestone in both of their careers and highlights the growing conversation around mental wellness in professional sports.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at the Use and Criticism of Puns in The Atlantic</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the long and storied history of puns within the pages of The Atlantic, dating back to its co-founder, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Despite often being maligned, wordplay has been a consistent feature of the magazine, with writers simultaneously denouncing and employing puns. The piece traces the changing attitudes toward this form of humor, from its high favor in the 19th century to its decline and modern-day status as a "wise-crack." It highlights several historical examples, including a surprisingly durable pun about the 1860 presidential election, demonstrating the enduring, if sometimes groan-inducing, nature of the pun.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that 26 Western allies have committed to deploying troops to Ukraine immediately following a ceasefire agreement. Speaking after a summit of 35 countries, Macron stated that these security guarantees would be activated the moment hostilities cease. The plan for a "reassurance force" is expected to be finalized with U.S. support in the coming days, although direct U.S. ground troop involvement has been ruled out. This commitment comes as hopes for a diplomatic resolution have faded, with Russia continuing to send troops into Ukraine despite ongoing talks.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis on the Optimal Age for Claiming Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 13:26:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Determining the best age to claim Social Security benefits depends heavily on individual financial circumstances and needs. While claiming at age 62 provides immediate income, it results in a permanently reduced monthly payment. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) secures the standard benefit, but delaying until age 70 can increase payments by about 8% for each year of deferral. To maximize benefits, financial experts suggest creating alternative income streams, such as using 401(k) funds, creating bond ladders, or considering annuities, to bridge the financial gap and allow Social Security benefits to grow.

          <p>Chelsea has secured a deal to sign 20-year-old U.S. international forward Alyssa Thompson from Angel City in what is a club-record transfer. Thompson is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Women's Super League club. While Chelsea sources report the fee is just under £1 million, U.S. sources claim it could be an initial £1.1 million, potentially rising with add-ons. The signing provides a crucial boost to Chelsea's attack, which has been weakened by injuries to key players ahead of their season opener against Manchester City.</p>

          <p>Ford's redesigned, gas-powered Expedition SUV experienced a 53.7% sales increase in August compared to the previous year, marking its best performance in over two decades. This growth stands out as many consumers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expires. While Ford's EV sales also saw a significant increase, the strong performance of the large, traditionally powered SUV indicates sustained consumer demand for such vehicles. The success of the high-profit Expedition, with popular models starting around $74,000, provides a bright spot for the automaker's overall sales figures. (not investment advice)</p>
