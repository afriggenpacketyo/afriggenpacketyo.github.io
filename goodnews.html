          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that being a perfect mother is harmful and that flaws are an important part of motherhood. She encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and stop wondering if they're good enough. Ross points out that psychiatrists have historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, but emphasizes that mothers are essential and deserve more credit. The article concludes by urging mothers to embrace their imperfections and recognize that they are already good enough.</p>
