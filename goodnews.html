          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Opinion polls indicate Lee holds a significant lead over his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Lee's eligibility was previously questioned due to election law charges, but the court postponed a ruling until after the election. Analysts predict that if elected, Lee will focus on reviving South Korea's economy and renegotiating trade agreements with the U.S., potentially seeking more favorable terms compared to other countries.
