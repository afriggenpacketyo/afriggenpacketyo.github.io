          <h2>Study Finds Link Between Combined Estrogen-Progestin Hormone Therapy and Increased Breast Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 20:59:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, a treatment suitable for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This evolving science refines understanding from a controversial early 2000s study, highlighting that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial. Experts emphasize that patients should consult their doctors to weigh individual risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a major increase from 36% in 2020. Political experts suggest this is not a simple ideological move to conservatism but rather a turn towards populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party. Analysts point to the Democratic Party's focus on progressive cultural issues over a working-class economic agenda and a perceived failure on immigration reform as key factors alienating these voters.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against a Trump administration order that suspended access to asylum for individuals crossing the southern border. The court determined that the president lacks the authority under the constitution or federal law to implement such a ban. The policy, which immigrant rights groups challenged in a lawsuit, was described as an unprecedented "flat-out ban on all asylum." In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president cannot create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress.</p>

He pointed to the new U.S. trade deal with Vietnam, which lowered a threatened tariff, causing stocks of companies manufacturing there, like Nike and Gap, to rise. Cramer also noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low is a positive trend for U.S.-based consumer packaged goods companies, as it makes their exports more competitive on the global market.

It also delves into the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," detailing how the filmmakers and the band Los Lobos revitalized his music for a new generation.
