          <p>The Senate confirmed Charles Kushner to serve as the ambassador to France and Monaco by a vote of 51-45. Kushner was pardoned by Trump during the president's first term for crimes including federal tax evasion and FEC violations. During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Kushner stated that he had made "very, very, very serious mistakes" but believed his mistakes made him "better with my judgment, better in my view of life, better in my values to really make me more qualified to do this job." Kushner is the father of Trump's son-in-law and former advisor, Jared Kushner. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with both the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, the deals involved politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's position as a midsize economy. The agreement with the EU will generate benefits by 2040, while the deal with the US lowers tariffs on British luxury cars. These agreements highlight Britain's efforts to find its way in a changing global trade environment. </p>

          <p>Sesame Street has partnered with Netflix to ensure its continued availability following funding cuts and the termination of a deal with Warner Bros Discovery.

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is modifying its menu to remove red dye No. 40 from its strawberry shake and pink lemonade, in response to the FDA's plan to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes. The burger chain will replace the red dye with beta carotene and vegetable juice, and switch to real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in its ketchup. This decision aligns with the government's initiative to promote healthier food options and reduce the use of potentially harmful additives. These changes reflect a broader trend towards more natural and health-conscious ingredients in the fast-food industry. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite trade tensions with the United States, China attracted a net capital inflow of $17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This influx contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and the recent downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets amid ongoing trade disputes. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange reported the capital inflow from both individuals and companies, indicating continued confidence in the Chinese market.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will initiate offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea. This initiative seeks to leverage marine vegetation, such as mangroves and kelp, which absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with organizations like the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact. This effort aims to enhance Japan's carbon capture capabilities to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. </p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, aiming to stimulate economic growth amid a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This decision follows a series of measures, including deposit rate reductions by state-backed lenders, to protect their net interest margin. The move is part of a broader stimulus package to support the economy, with further easing expected by the end of the year.  (not investment advice)</p>

The grueling journey involved physical challenges, including lost toenails and hallucinations, but Goodge drew strength from his mother's battle with cancer. </p>
