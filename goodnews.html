          <p>This article explores the history of electric vehicles, noting their early popularity in the 1900s before being overtaken by cheaper gasoline-powered cars. The article draws parallels between the political and market challenges faced by early EVs and the current efforts by some Republican leaders to undermine electric vehicle growth through policy and tax incentives. Jay Leno's restored 1909 Baker Electric car is featured as an example of early EV technology, highlighting the historical context of home charging and gendered marketing. The article concludes by suggesting that while political and gender-based stereotypes may hinder EV adoption in the United States, technical advancements could give EVs a significant edge over gasoline vehicles in the future.</p>

          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen who died in the crash of the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait" are being returned to their hometowns.

A relative of one of the crew members initiated an investigation that led to the discovery of the crash site and the recovery of remains, allowing for closure for the families of the fallen soldiers.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to address command issues that have led to recent struggles, including blown saves. Despite his strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, Scott has been leaving too many pitches in the middle of the zone, resulting in hitters making solid contact. With several key relievers injured, the Dodgers are relying on Scott to regain his effectiveness and stabilize the bullpen. The coaching staff is encouraging Scott to prioritize missing bats over simply throwing strikes, even if it means issuing more walks.</p>
