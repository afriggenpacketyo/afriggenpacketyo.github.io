        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Antonio Filosa has stepped into the role of CEO at Stellantis, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who resigned amid disagreements with the company's board. Filosa, who previously served as head of the company's Americas operations, aims to revitalize Stellantis' performance, mend strained relationships with dealers and employees, and manage the transition to electrified models. He faces challenges including sales declines and a drop in net profit, with industry experts noting the need to balance investments between traditional vehicles and electric vehicles. Filosa's appointment is viewed as a logical choice for the automaker as it navigates regulatory uncertainty and global economic concerns. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the challenges ahead but also the potential for improvement under new leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has announced a stock buyback of up to $400 million, which led to a rise in Trump Media stock premarket. The company has approximately $3 billion on its balance sheet, giving it the flexibility to support shareholder returns. The buyback could include both common stock and warrants, executed through open market transactions, and all repurchased shares would be retired. The announcement follows Trump Media's $2.5 billion raise last month from institutional investors, with plans to buy bitcoin and launch Trump-branded exchange-traded funds. The score reflects the potential for growth but also the speculative nature of the company's ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that parents who have an easier time getting their children to listen avoid using threats, bribes, or harsh consequences.

The expert provides five alternative phrases to replace toxic phrases that instantly make kids not want to listen, emphasizing the importance of creating conditions where cooperation feels natural. The score is high due to the positive impact of the recommended parenting techniques.</p>

          <p>Public spending tied to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris last summer reached almost ‚Ç¨6 billion, according to an initial estimate by the national auditing body. The organization of the Games cost ‚Ç¨2.77 billion, while infrastructure projects cost a further ‚Ç¨3.19 billion. Tony Estanguet, who led the organizing committee, questioned the estimates, arguing that the figure does not reflect the economic benefits of the Games. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the success of the Games but also the high cost to taxpayers.</p>
