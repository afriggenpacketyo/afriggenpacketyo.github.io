          <p>Marjut Hannonen, the EU's head of trade in Beijing, indicated that the European Union is not interested in reviving the stalled Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, citing a deterioration in trade ties over the past two decades due to increasing barriers for businesses. Despite lobbying from Chinese officials, the EU has no intentions to resume negotiations on the investment deal. The European Parliament had previously delayed ratification of the agreement in 2021 due to concerns over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Recently, some sanctions were lifted, but the EU remains firm in its decision.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign minister stated that Berlin is willing to "follow" US President Trump's demand for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. This announcement comes amid discussions among NATO members about defense expenditure targets, with some countries considering 5% unrealistic. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has suggested a compromise involving increasing classic military spending to 3.5% and investing the remaining 1.5% in defense-related infrastructure. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that reaching the 5% target would be financially challenging.</p>

The plant is expected to be operational by 2027 and will manufacture display driver chips for various electronic devices. This deal aligns with India's "Semiconductor Mission," aimed at building a strong chip and display ecosystem in the country, and it comes as Apple suppliers increasingly shift operations to India amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts, with the services sector and production driving the expansion. Despite this positive growth, which outpaced other major economies like the US and Germany, analysts caution that the strong rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. Business investment rose, but concerns linger about the impact of global trade tensions on future economic performance. A distillery CEO stated that the business will absorb the tariffs and keep prices stable in the US.</p>

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has implemented a code of conduct to prevent political statements during the competition.

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices, which have been near record highs due to a supply shortfall. The government plans to release 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned. This move may reduce the government's stockpile to a level that raises concerns about responding to future poor harvests. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements to encourage more participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that spending time in nature may help ease pain and promote recovery from physical injuries. Studies have shown that forest bathing and exposure to natural environments can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, while other research indicates that time in nature can benefit people suffering from physical pain or brain injuries. Experts say that nature gives the brain a break from the stresses of modern life, promoting restoration and emotional well-being, which can positively impact physical recovery. Regular walks and observation of nature can lead to a healthier relationship with the environment.</p>

The discovery was made by chance during research for a book, and its authenticity was confirmed through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging.

          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced significant growth due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate in the coming years but notes that potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are unlikely to have a significant impact. Most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders. The IMF projects medium-term growth around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

The "Great Charter," the first extant expression in writing of the principle that a king and his government are not above the law, originally dates from June 1215, when it was signed by King John. Harvard obtained the document in the 1940s for just $27.50, the equivalent of just over $470 (‚Ç¨420) today, according to a US Department of Labor inflation calculator.</p>
