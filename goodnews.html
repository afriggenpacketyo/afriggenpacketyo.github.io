          <p>Starbucks is implementing changes to its pricing structure for beverage add-ins, including matcha and syrups, to standardize costs across stores. The company will charge 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce modifying an unflavored drink but will not charge for substituting flavors in pre-flavored drinks. Additionally, Starbucks plans to charge $1 for adding a scoop of matcha powder to non-matcha drinks and 50 cents for including dried fruit. These changes are part of CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to improve customer service and the overall Starbucks experience, with the company also testing real-time pricing updates in its app. </p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aiming for an additional $1 billion in savings for the next fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up by 10%. While FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling below expectations, the company's long-term cost-cutting initiative, DRIVE, is expected to improve profitability. The company expects revenue to be flat to up 2% year over year for the fiscal first quarter of 2026, though this guidance includes a $170 million headwind from international exports.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called a lawsuit filed by hardware startup Iyo "silly" after OpenAI removed an announcement about acquiring Jony Ive's AI startup io from its website. Iyo accused OpenAI of trademark infringement after OpenAI announced the acquisition of Ive's AI startup, io. Altman stated that Iyo CEO Jason Rugolo had persistently sought investment from OpenAI before filing the lawsuit. OpenAI removed the blog post due to a court order following Iyo's trademark complaint, while Altman shared screenshots of emails from Rugolo seeking investment and a potential transaction involving Iyo's intellectual property. </p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, impacting 317 individuals, citing changes in California law and a desire to correct criminal behavior. The decision follows legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased, targeting Latino criminal organizations while ignoring white supremacist gangs. The move aligns Orange County with other California jurisdictions that have moved away from gang injunctions due to concerns over their broad scope and impact on civil rights. Spitzer said his office could seek new injunctions under the revised definition of gang activity if necessary. </p>

The jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, enhancing the Royal Air Force's capabilities with longer range and a wider range of weapons. The decision is seen as a victory for the RAF, despite the UK's reliance on the US for the release and use of nuclear weapons. </p>

The court found that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books was "quintessentially transformative" and protected under the "fair use" doctrine. However, Anthropic will face a separate trial in December regarding its use of millions of pirated books, with court documents revealing concerns among employees about the legality of using pirate sites.
