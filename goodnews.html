          <p>A fire broke out in a chapel within the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain but was swiftly extinguished by firefighters, preventing a major catastrophe. The blaze, believed to have been caused by a short circuit in an electric sweeper, prompted a rapid response that contained the flames before they could cause extensive damage to the UNESCO World Heritage site. The monument, a jewel of Islamic architecture later converted into a cathedral, is a major tourist attraction. Officials praised the firefighters for their magnificent intervention that averted a disaster reminiscent of the 2019 Notre Dame fire.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by several California district attorneys alleging the retailer overcharged customers. The lawsuit claimed that Walmart sold products, particularly items priced by weight like produce and baked goods, for more than their advertised prices, violating state consumer protection laws. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California stores.

          <p>Disney, Lucasfilm, and actress Gina Carano have settled a lawsuit over her 2021 termination from the show "The Mandalorian." Carano was fired after making a series of controversial social media posts that the company deemed "abhorrent," sparking a debate about free speech and cancel culture. While the settlement details remain confidential, Lucasfilm issued a statement praising Carano's professionalism and expressing hope for future collaboration. The article argues that the settlement was the right course of action, correcting an initial overreaction by the company in response to social media pressure.</p>

First launched in 1965, the Transit revolutionized the commercial vehicle market with its versatility, space, and car-like comfort, becoming the world's best-selling van. Though UK production ceased in 2013, with manufacturing moved to Turkey, Ford's UK facilities remain central to its design and engineering. As the brand moves toward an electric and software-defined future, it faces a more competitive market where its historic brand loyalty is being tested.</p>

          <p>A surprising political friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a conservative Republican, and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, a prominent Labour Party figure. Despite their starkly different political ideologies, the two have bonded over shared experiences, including difficult childhoods and their Christian faith. Vance is currently on a personal holiday in the UK, which began with a stay at Lammy's official country residence. This relationship is seen as a potentially valuable diplomatic channel, particularly given the personalized nature of politics under the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Claim of Trump's Plane Flying to Epstein's Island 37 Times</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times is unsubstantiated. A fact-checking investigation found no evidence to support the claim and noted several inconsistencies. Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane like Trump's, with visitors typically arriving by boat or helicopter. Furthermore, the Facebook user who originated the claim used a photo with a pin from a commercially available pilot costume, casting doubt on his credentials.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood has established a four-shot lead in the second round of the St. Jude Championship in Memphis before severe weather suspended play. Following an opening round of 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under-par 64, bringing his total to 13 under and putting him in a strong position to claim his first PGA Tour victory. When play was halted due to lightning, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were tied for second place at nine under. Twenty-one players, including Justin Rose, were still on the course and will complete their rounds once play resumes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has started issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, according to a U.S. official. This move reverses a previous ban and removes a major obstacle for the chipmaker's access to the critical Chinese market, which had been affected by broad U.S. export controls aimed at curbing Beijing's technological and military development. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with U.S. regulations after stricter curbs were imposed. The company has warned the restrictions could significantly impact its sales revenue.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this could democratize retirement savings and offer potentially higher returns, while experts caution about the increased risks, higher fees, and lack of transparency associated with these assets. The implementation timeline is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether employers will adopt these new, more complex options for their workers' retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," offers an intimate look at the life of the influential musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film, directed by Amy Berg, moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist to present a more nuanced portrait through archival material and interviews with his mother, friends, and bandmates. It explores his turbulent upbringing, his creative blossoming in New York City, and his conflicting feelings about the fame that followed his iconic album "Grace." The review praises the film for thoughtfully dimensionalizing Buckley as a person rather than just a myth.</p>
