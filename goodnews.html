          <h2>Psychiatrist Offers Five Simple Parenting Rules for Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 09:43:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults shares five rules for parents navigating the complexities of child-rearing in the modern age. The advice emphasizes trusting parental instincts and cultural traditions over influencer trends and clickbait. Parents are encouraged to focus on their child's individual interests and foster enjoyment in activities rather than obsessing over developmental milestones. The article concludes by urging parents to be authentic and provide love and attention, as perfection is unattainable and genuine emotional expression is crucial for children's development. The psychiatrist argues that every generation has faced unique parenting challenges, and this one is no different. </p>

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a tumor on a woman's spine through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. The patient, who had been experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, and during an MRI, doctors discovered a second chordoma on her spine. The surgeons developed a unique surgical plan, called the "third nostril" approach, practicing the technique for weeks before the 20-hour procedure. The patient is now cancer-free and recovering, with doctors hoping the procedure can be used for other difficult-to-reach tumors. </p>

          <p>A Harvard-trained educator argues that kids who learn how to use AI effectively will become smarter adults, emphasizing that the key is to avoid simply copying and pasting AI-generated answers. The educator suggests that AI can be a valuable tool for learning if students ask follow-up questions to understand how chatbots arrive at their conclusions. Experts recommend using AI for tasks that don't involve the final product, such as creating outlines, and always double-checking its factual claims. The educator's research indicates that students who used AI to practice writing cover letters produced stronger letters on their own. </p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that many Americans are anxious about their savings as they approach retirement age. While Fidelity recommends having six times your annual income saved by age 50, other experts argue there's no magic number, as individual spending habits and retirement plans vary. Experts advise working backward by determining desired annual retirement income, estimating the duration of income needs, and adjusting for inflation. If feeling behind, experts recommend starting immediately and considering strategies to catch up and retire comfortably. </p>
