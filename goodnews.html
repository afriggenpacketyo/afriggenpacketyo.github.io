        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is determined to push forward with plans to cut the benefits bill by ¬£5 billion by 2030, despite potential rebellion within the Labour Party. The Welfare Reform Bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Starmer insists the current system is not working for those needing support or taxpayers, emphasizing the necessity for reform to address these issues. The Prime Minister maintains that everyone agrees the system needs reform, and the government intends to deliver on that promise. Optimism for the bill's success hinges on addressing the concerns of both beneficiaries and taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy are closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel but are hesitant to make definitive oil price predictions. Both countries have exchanged strikes, raising concerns about potential disruptions to global energy supplies, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz. While forward prices are already experiencing significant effects, the CEOs emphasize the unpredictable nature of geopolitical events and their impact on oil markets. The Strait of Hormuz remains open, but any potential blockade would have significant effects on prices as customers around the world would be scrambling to meet their own energy needs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, a move that further aligns the country with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC, along with their subsidiaries, on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List." This regulation requires domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. The action is likely aimed at reinforcing existing U.S. export restrictions and tightening loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist.</p>

          <p>Japan is strengthening its cyber defense capabilities, with a new law allowing preemptive measures to protect critical infrastructure. The legislation enables the government to monitor online communications and take early action against harmful servers, involving police and the Self-Defense Forces. This shift from reactive to preemptive defense is driven by increasing cyber threats from state-backed hackers, prompting the private sector to enhance its cybersecurity measures. The government plans to develop a comprehensive strategy by the end of the year to implement a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies that helped boost consumer spending. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates. This increase provides a welcome respite for China's economy, which has been struggling with persistent deflation. The improvement in consumption is attributed to the consumer goods trade-in program, a surge in online shopping, and increased foreign tourism, though concerns remain about the real estate market and uncertainty in trade policies (not investment advice).</p>
