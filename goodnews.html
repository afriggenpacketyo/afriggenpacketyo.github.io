          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with both net sales and net profit beating forecasts. The company, which is the sole producer of crucial EUV lithography machines for advanced chips, also reported strong net bookings, indicating healthy future demand. However, ASML issued cautious revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter and expressed uncertainty about its growth prospects for 2026, citing macroeconomic and geopolitical instability. This warning comes despite continued strong demand from AI-related customers for its next-generation technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the end of deployment for 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which is half the total force sent to the city to address protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The deployment, ordered by President Trump against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been a source of significant political and legal conflict. Local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, praised the withdrawal as a victory for peaceful protest and civic unity. Governor Newsom called for the remaining troops to be sent home, describing their presence as political theater without a clear mission.</p>

          <p>Twenty years ago, a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy shot a historic course-record 61 at Royal Portrush, the venue for this week's Open Championship. Those who played with or watched him that day recall it as a pivotal moment that signaled his future superstardom. His playing partner, Aaron O'Callaghan, remembers the crowd swelling as word spread of the teenager's incredible performance, which included an eagle and five consecutive birdies to finish. The round, which remains a piece of golf lore, showcased the singular focus and immense talent that would eventually lead McIlroy to become a multiple major champion.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International fell over 6% despite the company issuing a highly optimistic earnings forecast. The company, famous for its "blind box" toys and the popular Labubu character, projected a profit increase of at least 350% for the first half of 2025. Analysts suggest the negative stock reaction could reflect investor belief that the company's explosive growth may have peaked, prompting profit-taking. This market skepticism persists even as Pop Mart's overseas sales surge and many investment banks maintain a bullish outlook on the brand's consumer appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after the event, a South Korean court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues his actions were a patriotic effort to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, not a self-serving coup. The case re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history and forces a national reckoning with two deeply divisive figures. The retrial, which will consider evidence of torture during the original investigation, occurs in a modern context where questions about democracy have resurfaced.</p>

In the shootout, Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs on three swings to clinch the win for the NL, earning him the All-Star MVP award.
