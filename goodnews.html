          <p>Joe Root demonstrated exceptional skill and grit, finishing the day unbeaten on 99 as England reached 251-4 against India in the third Test at Lord's. On a challenging, slow pitch, England had to adopt a more cautious approach, battling India's disciplined bowling attack. After losing two early wickets and two more after tea, Root anchored the innings, first with Ollie Pope and then with captain Ben Stokes. His performance has put England in a stable position heading into the second day of the match.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's remarks praising Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article details six key facts about Liberia's unique relationship with the United States. Founded in 1822 by freed American slaves, English is its official language, and its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe. The country's flag, culture, and institutions bear a strong resemblance to American counterparts. The piece provides context for why many Liberians speak with an American accent, a point Trump may have noticed without understanding its historical origins.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested a potential meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit. If the meeting occurs, it would mark the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office in January. Rubio also mentioned that the U.S. might seek China's assistance in encouraging Russia to end the war in Ukraine. This development comes despite Rubio, known for his hawkish stance on China, being personally sanctioned by Beijing twice.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that the company's robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, will expand its service area, with a potential launch in the Bay Area pending regulatory approval. Additionally, Musk stated that xAI's chatbot, Grok, will be integrated into Tesla vehicles soon, following the release of a new update. These announcements come during a challenging period for Musk, who has recently engaged in a public feud with President Trump over a major tax bill. The conflict has raised investor concerns and contributed to a decline in Tesla's stock value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the origins and evolution of the term "middlebrow," tracing it back to early 20th-century literary debates, particularly involving Virginia Woolf. Woolf famously derided the middlebrow as a dishonest consumer of art, lacking the conviction of either the "highbrow" intellectual or the "lowbrow" populist. The essay explores how this pejorative term has since softened to describe pedestrian tastes, from popular music to department stores. It reflects on how the battle of cultural tastes was shaped by mass communication and continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about art and consumption.</p>

          <p>Many people who suffer from migraines find their symptoms worsen during the summer, and a neurologist explains the potential factors. Weather-related changes, such as intense sun and shifts between outdoor heat and indoor air conditioning, can act as triggers. Other contributing factors include dehydration and changes in routine, such as sleep patterns or alcohol consumption during summer activities. To help prevent attacks, experts recommend staying well-hydrated, wearing sunglasses to block bright light, getting adequate rest, and using fragrance-free summer products like sunscreen.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates near all-time highs, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a solution to overwhelming balances. This article details six signs that this strategy could save you money, such as when your monthly interest payments exceed your principal payments. Other indicators include being eligible for a significant balance reduction, facing a lengthy repayment timeline, or being hit with high penalty APRs. The goal of debt forgiveness is to negotiate a lump-sum settlement with creditors for less than the total amount owed. (not investment advice)</p>

The sale followed an intense 10-minute bidding war, with the iconic black leather bag ultimately going to a private collector from Japan. The bag was conceived after Birkin lamented to the head of Hermès on a flight that she couldn't find a suitable, practical handbag. She later donated the original to a charity auction in 1994.</p>

CEO Ed Bastian confirmed that bookings have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, although at lower levels than initially forecast. The airline now anticipates full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share. The positive forecast was driven by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express, which helped offset a drop in main cabin revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. CDs, conversely, offer a fixed rate for their entire term, providing guaranteed returns. A calculation shows that for 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, a CD currently offers slightly higher, guaranteed earnings than a money market account, making it a more profitable choice for savers who can lock away their funds.

This includes common practices like the castration of pigs, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. The law aims to increase transparency for consumers, effectively treating meat produced under such conditions like a vice product with a warning label. While animal advocates wanted an outright ban on such imports, the law represents a significant experiment in pushing back against the concealment of animal suffering in the food industry.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the phenomenon of intense fandom surrounding grocery store chains like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B. It argues that in an era of declining traditional affiliations, consumer behavior has taken the place of religion or politics as a primary way people form communities and signal their identity. These stores cultivate loyalty by reflecting their shoppers' values, whether regional pride, health consciousness, or cultural heritage. An anthropologist suggests this "tribalism" is a powerful social driver, turning a utilitarian space into a cornerstone of personal and community identity.</p>
