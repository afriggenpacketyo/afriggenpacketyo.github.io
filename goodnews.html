          <p>Several companies, including London-based Better Dairy, are developing cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. While proponents claim the product tastes similar to traditional cheese and offers health benefits, it faces significant challenges. The plant-based food market has seen a recent decline, and consumers are concerned about cost and the ultra-processed nature of such foods. Despite these obstacles, startups are targeting a 2027 launch, hoping to overcome regulatory hurdles and win over consumers.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, England, has been reunited with the older brother she never knew she had after her father revealed a long-held family secret. Following her mother's death, Jess Basey-Fisher learned that her mother had given up a baby for adoption years before she met her father. Using ancestry websites, she tracked down her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, who was living in Australia. The siblings connected emotionally, but soon after, Alistair was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to support him and make memories together.</p>

          <p>After a period of declining viewership, the reality show 'Love Island' is experiencing a revival, with audience figures returning to levels not seen in years. A significant driver of this renewed interest appears to be social media, particularly TikTok, where the show's official accounts have gained over a million followers in 2025. Many viewers now consume the show through short clips, recaps, and commentary online rather than watching the full nightly episodes. While this expands the show's reach, some critics and former contestants warn that it can lead to a distorted perception of the participants.</p>

          <p>Sweden secured a decisive 4-1 victory against eight-time champions Germany, finishing at the top of their group in the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. The win was a powerful statement from a Swedish side that has historically fallen short in major finals, having last won the Euros in the inaugural 1984 competition. Players and fans expressed a renewed sense of belief, with midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd stating there is "something different" about the squad this year. While Germany also progresses to the quarterfinals, the heavy defeat exposed significant defensive vulnerabilities for the team to address.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. In his return to the mound following Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, striking out four and allowing only one hit. His dominant start set a positive tone for the team, which had been struggling for momentum. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's performance was seen as the crucial catalyst in halting the team's longest losing skid since 2017.</p>

          <p>England clinched a 2-0 series victory over Argentina after a dramatic late try from Jack van Poortvliet secured a 22-17 win in the second Test. The match was tightly contested, with the scores tied at 17-17 for most of the second half. In the final moments, a break by Guy Pepper set up his fellow replacement Van Poortvliet to score in the corner, sealing the win for an England side missing many of its senior players. The victory marks England's sixth consecutive Test win and provides a significant boost for head coach Steve Borthwick's developing squad.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for contributing to China's declining birth rate by replacing traditional human roles, one demography expert argues this may not be entirely negative. As AI technology advances, it can fulfill needs for emotional companionship and elderly care, which historically incentivized marriage and childbearing. This shift is embraced by some younger Chinese citizens who prefer a single life and see AI as a viable support system for their future. The expert suggests that the AI revolution could redefine family structures, making traditional concerns about population numbers less relevant.</p>

          <p>In what is being called the shortest call in the show's history, finance personality Dave Ramsey gave blunt advice to a listener of 20 years. The caller, a real estate agent named Chad, had $211,000 in cash and a remaining mortgage of $95,000, and asked for confirmation on whether to pay it off. Ramsey's immediate response was, "Good Lord. Pay it off today," ending the call in under a minute. The moment highlights Ramsey's core philosophy of eliminating debt to achieve financial freedom, prioritizing emotional peace over potentially higher investment returns. (not investment advice)</p>
