          <p>The Trump administration has requested an emergency injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court to halt proceedings in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group, sued DOGE seeking public access to its records and plans for government overhaul. The administration is claiming executive privilege, asserting that DOGE, as a presidential advisory board, is exempt from FOIA regulations. The case is ongoing, and the Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for transparency and government oversight.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to limit future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with high-risk conditions, marking a significant shift in policy. This change would apply to updated versions of the vaccine, with FDA officials arguing that annual booster shots are not worth the risk for healthy individuals. The FDA plans to impose these restrictions unless vaccine makers conduct newer and lengthy placebo-controlled trials. Experts caution that lengthy trials may result in vaccines that are no longer effective against circulating variants, while others worry about barriers for those who want to protect vulnerable family members.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent inflation surprise indicates that the economic outlook may be gloomier than previously thought, with the UK experiencing the highest inflation in a year, driven by rising energy and water bills. While pay rises are outpacing price increases for many workers, concerns remain about persistent price pressures in services like restaurant meals. Economists suggest that inflation could inch up further in the coming months before falling back, potentially limiting the Bank of England's ability to cut interest rates. Factors such as US trade policies and global commodity prices could influence future inflation trends, making it an uncertain and painful situation for households whose incomes are not keeping pace.</p>

Banks's Culture series envisions a post-scarcity galactic society valuing empathy, pluralism, and cooperation, standing in stark contrast to Silicon Valley's ethos. The series critiques wealth inequality and hierarchical structures, presenting a world where AI handles governance, freeing citizens for leisure and personal growth.

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix, an iconic Formula 1 race known for its grandeur and history, faces scrutiny over whether it has become less exciting due to the difficulty of overtaking on the narrow, winding streets of Monte Carlo.

With limited overtaking opportunities, the race classification often remains unchanged from start to finish, leading to criticism from drivers.

The new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine.
