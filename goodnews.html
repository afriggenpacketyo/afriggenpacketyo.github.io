          <h2>World Bank Reverses Ban on Funding Nuclear Power Projects</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has ended its ban on funding nuclear power projects, marking a significant policy reversal. This decision could help poorer nations industrialize, reduce planet-warming emissions, and enhance U.S. competitiveness in the development of next-generation reactors. The move reflects a growing recognition of nuclear energy's potential to contribute to global energy needs while addressing climate change. By lifting the ban, the World Bank aims to support countries in their efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources and achieve sustainable development goals. This reversal could lead to increased investment in nuclear infrastructure in developing countries. The decision signals a shift towards embracing nuclear energy as a viable option for addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has expressed regret over some of his recent criticisms of President Trump, stating that they "went too far" following their public falling-out. This comes after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a public exchange of insults and accusations between the two. Vice President Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly urged Musk to repair his relationship with Trump. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Mr. Trump was "appreciative" of the public apology from Musk. This public reconciliation could impact the relationship between the tech industry and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Scottie Scheffler has deleted his Venmo account after receiving numerous unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance. Scheffler stated that he was either getting paid by people or people requesting money when he didn't win, which led him to remove the app. Venmo encourages users to be cautious of unexpected payments or requests and advises against accepting transfers from strangers. The article also provides tips on how to protect privacy on Venmo, such as adjusting account settings to limit the visibility of transactions to friends only or making them private. These safety tips can help users mitigate the risks of online scams.</p>

The popular payment app enables users to send requests and payments to Venmo accounts listed as public ‚Äî a default setting that opened up a can of worms for the world's top golfer, Scottie Scheffler. Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance. While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.</p>

          <p>The draft trade agreement with China announced by Donald Trump would ease concerns from top US military suppliers about rare-earth metals and magnets, which are crucial for the production of various weapons. The deal would ensure that China will supply full magnets and any necessary rare earths up front. China had previously imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements during trade negotiations. Rare earths are crucial to the production of F-35 fighter jets, nuclear-powered submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and smart bombs. This agreement underscores the dependence of the US defense industry on Chinese rare earth metals.</p>

Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s. Combined with gold's soaring price, it is now second only to the U.S. dollar as their biggest reserve holding in value terms, the ECB said in its analysis Wednesday. In 2023, gold and the euro were roughly level at around 16.5% as a share of global official reserves on average, a CNBC calculation of ECB data showed. (not investment advice)</p>
