          <p>Ford Motor Co. is recalling approximately 200,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs from model years 2021-2025 because of a potential defect in the door latches. The electronic door latches may remain locked after a driver or front seat passenger exits, possibly trapping rear seat passengers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) stated that notification letters to owners were scheduled to be sent on June 23. Ford dealerships will address the problem by updating the vehicles' software, with the remedy expected to be available by late September.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century oil painting in Florence's Uffizi Gallery was allegedly damaged when a museum visitor tripped while attempting to take a selfie. The tourist reportedly fell backward while trying to "make a meme in front" of a portrait of Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany. The museum director, Simone Verde, stated that the damage could be repaired quickly but warned that restrictions on visitor behavior might be imposed in the future to prevent similar incidents.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has banned the WhatsApp messaging service on all House devices due to cybersecurity concerns. The Office of Cybersecurity cited a "lack of transparency" in how WhatsApp protects user data, the absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks. The memo from the chief administrative officer recommended using alternative messaging apps such as Microsoft Teams, Amazon Wickr, Signal, Apple iMessage, and Facetime. This decision reflects growing concerns about data security and privacy in digital communications.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, claiming the telehealth company sold "illegitimate, knockoff versions" of its weight-loss drug, Wegovy. The Danish drugmaker accused Hims & Hers of "deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk" and failing to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization. Novo Nordisk began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies to combat a nationwide shortage and shift patients from using knock-off versions. The company's investigation revealed that ingredients in these knock-off drugs were manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and were not FDA-inspected.</p>

In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families. Larger families were slightly more common in the western federal states.</p>
