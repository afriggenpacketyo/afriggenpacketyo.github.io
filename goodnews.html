          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the absence of reported casualties raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed 7.18% to settle at $71.48. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate after President Donald Trump's actions against Iran, with some suggesting Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for peace in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic senators, including John Hickenlooper, Elizabeth Warren, and Tammy Baldwin, have rented space at the Kennedy Center to host a Pride event called Love Is Love. The event, directed by Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley, will feature songs celebrating gay culture. This move is seen by some as a response to President Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center and subsequent cancellation of a Hamilton production. The Kennedy Center itself is not involved in programming the event, but the White House has proposed a significant increase in its federal funding. The event can be seen as a reoccupation of the Kennedy Center after Trump took over the Kennedy Center in February. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Iran's missile attack on the United States' Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar caused minimal damage and no American casualties. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the attack, which he said was "very effectively countered." He claimed that 13 of the 14 missiles fired were intercepted, and the 14th was headed in a nonthreatening direction. Trump expressed hope that Iran would now proceed to peace and harmony in the region and encouraged Israel to do the same. The President also said that Iran has ‚Äúgotten it all out of their ‚Äòsystem,‚Äô and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, opening a $10,000 2-year Certificate of Deposit (CD) account could be a smart move for savers looking to protect and grow their money. With CD interest rates remaining high, savers can earn over $800 in interest with little effort, securing long-term protection against market volatility. A 2-year CD also provides time to think about long-term financial goals, offering a respite from the constant evaluation of savings options. While it requires discipline to avoid early withdrawal penalties, the potential return and stability make it a valuable decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly submitted an improved bid exceeding ¬£60m for Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo, following a rejected initial offer. Talks are expected to continue this week for the Cameroon forward, who could become the club's second signing of the summer. Mbeumo's Premier League experience is seen as a significant advantage for manager Ruben Amorim, who seeks players ready to perform immediately. Brentford is likely to demand a fee comparable to what Wolves received for Matheus Cunha, considering Mbeumo's remaining contract year. The club is aiming to strengthen the squad before pre-season training commences on July 7. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for "everyone" to keep oil prices down amid escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. Trump warned that failure to do so would play "into the hands of the enemy" and urged the Department of Energy to increase drilling. Crude oil prices closed about 7% lower on Monday after Iran fired missiles at a U.S. airbase in Qatar, but did not cause any casualties. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields stated that producers must keep oil prices down or risk playing into the hands of the enemy. (not investment advice)</p>

This move could have a significant impact on school lunches and the food industry, though some experts warn that simplifying the guidelines too much could distort scientific accuracy.
