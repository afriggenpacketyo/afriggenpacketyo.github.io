        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has again rejected former President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men formerly known as the Central Park Five. U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made alleging the exonerated men had killed someone and pled guilty to the crime.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has described the nation's benefits system as broken, stating that fixing it is a "moral imperative." His comments came a day after a revolt from his own party's backbench MPs forced the government to concede on planned welfare cuts. Starmer affirmed the importance of the welfare safety net but argued it should not become a "snare" preventing people from working, as the government faces ongoing internal debate over its reform plans.</p>

          <p>On the tenth anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage, a Maryland couple, Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, are reflecting on their pioneering legal battle. Although their 2004 lawsuit was unsuccessful in court, it helped build momentum for marriage equality, which Maryland voters passed in 2012. The couple expresses pride in their fight for their family's rights but also voices concern over recent efforts to challenge and overturn marriage equality protections nationwide.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a device capable of embossing braille on materials that commercial printers cannot handle. The student-designed machine is also operable by BISM's blind and low-vision employees, improving their workflow for an annual fundraiser.</p>

          <p>New genetic research from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a well-preserved 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. After analyzing DNA from over 130 skeletons, scientists found that where biological connections existed among household members buried together, the lineage was traced through the female line. This indicates that men may have moved into their wives' households upon marriage and that female offspring often remained, suggesting a society where identity and social structure were passed down through mothers.</p>
