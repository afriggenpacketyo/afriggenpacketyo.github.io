          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home located in Windsor Great Park. This move places them near their children's school and their current residence, Adelaide Cottage. The relocation follows their 2022 move from Kensington Palace and comes as the royal family announces cost-saving measures in its annual financial report. The new home, nestled in a large park, aligns with Princess Catherine's recently expressed appreciation for nature as a sanctuary during her cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump stated his intention to pursue a direct peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine, rather than a simple ceasefire. In a social media post, Trump asserted that a full peace deal was determined to be the most effective way to resolve the conflict. This announcement positions the administration's strategy ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, signaling a push for a more definitive and lasting resolution to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised U.S. President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts, stating they have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." The statement came after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which concluded without a formal ceasefire agreement but was framed by Trump as making significant progress. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support for Ukraine. European allies are reportedly set to join a video call to discuss the next steps.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's share fell from 56% to 49%. This shift is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and experimental designs are creating renewed competition, prompting speculation that Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests that building emotional endurance, the capacity to manage stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings, is a learnable skill. She recommends three key steps: using a visual aid to understand that struggle is part of the learning process, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues, and undertaking small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. According to Kennedy, these practices help individuals recognize that frustration is a sign of growth, not failure, making it easier to navigate challenging situations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war with Russia. The announcement followed Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which he described as a "very successful day." In a social media post, Trump stated that a direct peace agreement, rather than a ceasefire, was determined to be the best path forward after calls with Zelenskyy and European leaders. European allies have welcomed the effort and expressed readiness to support a trilateral summit.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also indicates that those who do drink are consuming less, driven by growing concerns over the health impacts of alcohol. This trend aligns with recent scientific consensus, including guidance from the World Health Organization, that no level of alcohol consumption is considered safe for health. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, marking a significant public health shift.</p>

The activist firm is pushing for a series of changes, including a board refresh, cost reductions, and prioritizing share buybacks over acquisitions, suggesting these moves could significantly increase shareholder value.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson, who was ordered to pay $250,000 in damages. The lawsuit centered on Stewartson's public accusations that Patel was a "Kremlin asset" and had planned the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The judge issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own case.</p>

          <p>A fisherman using sonar technology in the Mississippi River may have helped solve the 57-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. The device detected a submerged car, which divers later confirmed to be a 1960s-era Buick containing human remains. Investigators matched the vehicle's identification number to the car Benn was driving when he went missing in September 1967. Authorities believe the remains belong to Benn, and they have been sent for forensic examination, potentially bringing closure to a case that has remained unresolved for decades.</p>

While some activists advocate for a generational shift, party strategists argue that well-known winners like Brown and Cooper offer the best chance to compete in challenging red-leaning states, making them a pragmatic choice despite their age.</p>

The early medieval object, believed to be a high-status item, was found near the route of Dere Street, a major Roman road. The discovery is particularly significant as it was made near the site where a similar piece was found in 2021, leading experts to believe the pair of objects may have been deliberately buried for ceremonial or religious purposes. The artifact will undergo further analysis before potentially being displayed in a museum.</p>

The company, Fold, aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase from current models, to strike high-value targets deeper behind enemy lines. While longer cables present technical challenges like increased weight and risk of snagging, the ability to conduct precision strikes without fear of jamming is a crucial advantage as the battlefield evolves and both sides move assets farther from the front.</p>

As part of a deal with Chinese state-owned defense contractor Norinco, Burkina Faso has received multiple large consignments of military hardware in 2024, including fire support vehicles and rocket launch systems. This growing military cooperation, re-established after diplomatic ties were restored in 2018, signals China's intent to position itself as a key security partner and expand its influence in the strategically important region.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with its murder rate on track to reach its lowest level in nearly 50 years. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying and intervening with the small number of individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence. The approach combines offers of social services, job training, and housing with the threat of targeted law enforcement for those who refuse help. This shift away from zero-tolerance policing represents a major civic effort following years of record violence and broken police-community trust.</p>
