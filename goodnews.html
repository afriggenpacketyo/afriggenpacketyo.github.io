          <p>Running back Nyheim Hines has reportedly reached a contract agreement with the Los Angeles Chargers, marking a potential return to the NFL. Hines missed the last two seasons after sustaining a significant ACL injury in a jet ski accident in July 2023 while with the Buffalo Bills. Now 28, he faces a competitive environment to secure a roster spot with the Chargers, who have established running backs Najee Harris and rookie Omarion Hampton. Hines is known for his dual-threat capabilities as both a rusher and a receiver, bringing valuable experience to the team.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has officially identified the remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed in action in 1968. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers killed when their remote radio navigation site in Laos was attacked by Vietnamese commandos. His body could not be recovered at the time. After decades of joint U.S.-Laos recovery efforts, remains discovered on the mountain earlier this year were confirmed to be his through DNA and anthropological analysis, providing long-awaited closure for his family.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., President Trump announced a new trade deal between the United States and the Philippines. According to a post on Truth Social, the agreement involves the Philippines becoming an "open market" with zero tariffs on U.S. goods, while the U.S. will impose a 19% tariff on products imported from the Philippines. This rate is slightly below a previously threatened 20% tariff. The deal also includes commitments to military cooperation, with Trump praising Marcos as a tough negotiator.

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced plans to launch a version of its classic cola in the U.S. sweetened with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, starting this fall. The move follows a social media post from President Trump claiming he had encouraged the company to make the switch. While Coke has used corn syrup in the U.S. since the 1980s, its cane sugar-based "Mexican Coke" has gained a dedicated following. The company framed the new product as a way to offer more choice, complementing its portfolio which has seen growth in low-sugar options.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it is porting its CUDA parallel computing platform to the RISC-V architecture, a significant move that could reshape the processor market. RISC-V is an open-source instruction set, meaning chipmakers can use it without paying licensing fees, unlike with ARM. This decision is seen as a strategic play to support China's push for technological independence and ensure Nvidia's GPUs remain central to its AI ecosystem. The move strengthens the viability of RISC-V globally, posing a major challenge to competitors like Intel, AMD, and ARM. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia by offering to provide personal information on high-profile UK officials.

He offered details on former defence secretary Sir Grant Shapps and applied for a UK Border Force job as part of his plan. Prosecutors stated Phillips was motivated by financial gain and was "brazen in his pursuit" of assisting a hostile state, leading to his conviction under the National Security Act.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the percentage of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. Twenty-seven percent of workers now report having a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, the lowest level since 2017. An analyst attributes the drop to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic anxiety that previously drove many to seek extra work. More people are now using side hustle income for discretionary spending rather than essential living expenses, signaling improved financial stability for some.</p>
