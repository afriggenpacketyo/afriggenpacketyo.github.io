          <p>China's outbound shipments in September rose 8.3% year-on-year, reaching US$328.6 billion, impressively surpassing forecasts and demonstrating resilience amidst persistent trade war uncertainty. Imports also improved significantly, increasing by 7.4%, indicating robust domestic demand. A vice-minister from the General Administration of Customs acknowledged a challenging external environment and rising trade uncertainties, yet highlighted the "strong resilience" of China's trade-in goods. This article emphasizes the unexpected strength of China's trade performance, driven by industrial upgrades and expanded trade partners, even as geopolitical tensions with the US continue to simmer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking Chinese study conducted on mice suggests that fathers can transmit the benefits of exercise, such as improved muscle mass, lower body fat, and stronger bones, to their offspring through genetic mechanisms. Conversely, the children of inactive mice demonstrated poorer performance in physical tests, highlighting the generational impact of lifestyle. The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal "Cell Metabolism," unequivocally highlights that paternal exercise provides a "cost-effective route to improve offspring health." The team further found that injecting sperm microRNAs from exercised mice into fertilized eggs effectively replicated these positive traits in the offspring, offering insights into epigenetic inheritance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are strategically delaying Shohei Ohtani's next pitching start until later in the National League Championship Series, opting for Yoshinobu Yamamoto in Game 2. This calculated decision allows Yamamoto to maintain his regular five-day rest schedule for a potential Game 6, a flexibility Ohtani typically doesn't have due to his two-way role. While sacrificing Ohtani's potential for two starts in the series, this adjustment could enable him to come out of the bullpen in a decisive Game 7. Manager Dave Roberts also acknowledged Ohtani's recent hitting slump, suggesting the adjusted schedule might allow him to focus solely on recalibrating his offensive performance for the remainder of the playoffs.</p>
