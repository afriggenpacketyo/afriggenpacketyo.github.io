          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has implemented a new rule allowing players to protect their rankings while undergoing fertility treatments. This policy enables players to take time off for procedures like egg or embryo freezing and return to the tour with a "Special Entry Ranking" based on their recent performance. The special ranking can be used for up to three tournaments after their return, providing a safety net as they resume their careers. This initiative expands the WTA's existing support programs, which include maternity leave, postpartum support, and fertility grants, as female athletes increasingly advocate for addressing fertility challenges.</p>

This hierarchy can create feelings of jealousy and loss among friends, especially when a friend's attention is divided or when single friends feel alienated by coupledom.</p>

However, analysts suggest that some institutions may be nearing their fill, potentially leading to a cooling in central bank purchases.
