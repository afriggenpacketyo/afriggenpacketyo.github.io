          <p>For the first time, Wimbledon has replaced its human line judges with an electronic line-calling system, leading to varied feedback from players and fans. The AI-powered HawkEye technology, already used at other Grand Slams, offers high accuracy but has been criticized for changing the traditional feel of the tournament. Some players, like Frances Tiafoe, miss the drama of the challenge system, while others have noted the automated calls can be too quiet to hear clearly amidst crowd noise. The move marks a significant shift from tradition to technology at the historic tennis championship.</p>
