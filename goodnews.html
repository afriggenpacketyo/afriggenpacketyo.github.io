          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of offering citizenship to foreign investors based on real estate investments, deeming it a "mere commercial transaction." Anti-corruption activist Manuel Delia, who campaigned against the program, celebrated the decision as a vindication of the work of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a murdered Maltese journalist. The court argued that EU citizenship requires a "genuine link" with the country, fostering solidarity and mutual trust among member states, which financial commitment alone cannot establish. While Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela stated the scheme had earned Malta over ‚Ç¨1.4 billion, the ruling has led to the program being reworked to align with the court's decision.</p>
