          <h2>Oil Prices Surge Following US-China Tariff Reduction Agreement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crude oil prices experienced a 4% increase after the United States and China reached an agreement to reduce tariffs, easing trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that further meetings are expected in the coming weeks to work towards a more comprehensive agreement. The tariff reductions, which will remain in place for 90 days, aim to stimulate economic growth and address concerns about a potential recession that had previously driven oil prices to four-year lows. Bessent also noted progress in discussions with China regarding fentanyl precursor drugs. Optimism spurred by the trade pause announcement also drove global financial markets sharply higher.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced its plans to tighten immigration controls, prioritizing skilled workers with degree-level qualifications for work visas. The proposed policy aims to reduce immigration by approximately 39,000 annually by 2029. While loosening visa rules for 'high potential individuals' and research interns, the new measures include doubling the residency period required for indefinite stay applications to 10 years, abolishing the care visa due to exploitation concerns, and implementing stricter English language requirements for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Despite aiming to reduce net migration, the government has refrained from setting an overall cap, emphasizing a 'controlled, selective, and fair' system.</p>

Copeland also highlights the potential impact on existing family relationships and the varying expectations people have when seeking out biological relatives, from understanding their origins to finding physical resemblances.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce import tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, signaling a temporary de-escalation in their trade war. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced that the U.S. would cut tariffs on Chinese goods from as high as 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariffs on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. This move follows negotiations in Geneva and has triggered a rally in global financial markets, with investors expressing optimism about potential trade agreements with other U.S. partners. While the pause eases threats of recession and inflation, some analysts caution that the 90-day period may not be sufficient to reach a lasting resolution.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar's royal family to potentially receive a luxury Boeing 747 jet for use as Air Force One, raising legal and ethical questions. Qatar has stated that the transfer of an aircraft for 'temporary use' is under discussion, while the White House insists any gift would be accepted in compliance with all applicable laws. Democrats and some Trump allies have criticized the move, citing constitutional restrictions on accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval. The potential value of the plane is estimated at $400 million, and it would require retrofitting and security clearances before use.</p>
