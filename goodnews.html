        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, with its value surging 44% this month. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further growth potential, partly due to its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with the newly public and soaring company, Circle. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is buoyed by increasing institutional interest. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision significantly curtails the use of universal injunctions, a legal tool lower courts have used to block presidential policies nationwide. This ruling stems from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. A universal injunction is a court order that stops the government from enforcing a policy against anyone, not just the parties in a specific case. The article explains that while this limits a key strategy for challenging executive actions, it will likely shift legal battles toward other methods, such as class-action lawsuits.</p>

          <h2>Economists Explain Why Recent US Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 15:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses to absorb the initial impact. These include front-loading inventory before tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing costs to protect consumers, and utilizing legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts caution that this stability may be temporary, and price increases could still materialize later if tariffs remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With home equity at historic highs, homeowners are considering borrowing options like home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

          <p>Formula 1 is abuzz with speculation about a potential move by champion driver Max Verstappen from Red Bull to Mercedes, a topic openly discussed by current Mercedes driver George Russell. While Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028, his team's recent performance dip and questions about its 2026 engine program could make a switch attractive. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has not denied the talks, though he called the move "not realistic at this stage."
