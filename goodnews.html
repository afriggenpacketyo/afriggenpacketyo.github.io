          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary, indicating voter dissatisfaction with the current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, though Pittsburgh hasn't had a Republican mayor since 1932, making the Democratic primary win crucial. Gainey's loss halts the momentum progressives had enjoyed in this Democratic stronghold, despite his efforts to address affordable housing. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would rebuild the city's tax base and take a conciliatory approach toward institutions like universities and real estate developers.</p>

          <p>Japan will introduce fast-track entry lanes for South Korean visitors at Tokyo's Haneda and Fukuoka airports in June to mark the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic relations. South Korea will implement similar measures for Japanese travelers at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan. This marks the first time Japan has established lanes exclusively for passengers of a specific nationality. The initiative aims to promote mutual exchange, benefiting visitors who have traveled between the two countries within the past year, reflecting strong tourism ties driven by cultural interests despite occasional historical and territorial tensions.</p>

          <p>In a major upset, Corey O'Connor defeated incumbent Ed Gainey in the Pittsburgh mayoral Democratic primary, backed by the party's "old guard" and some Republican donors. O'Connor, son of a former mayor, campaigned on revitalizing the downtown area and resourcing the police. Gainey, the city's first Black mayor, faced criticism over police leadership turnover and basic services despite economic data improvements. O'Connor's victory signals a shift away from Gainey's progressive policies, as O'Connor had pledged a more conciliatory approach toward powerful institutions.</p>

          <p>China's youth unemployment rate decreased to 15.8% in April, down from 16.5% in March, as the country prepares for a record number of university graduates entering the job market.

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumour types from weeks to hours, with surgeons calling it a "game changer." The method, developed at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour in as little as 90 minutes. This faster classification could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly and reduce anxiety while waiting for results. Several NHS hospitals are setting up their own testing alongside existing regimes to gather more evidence about its effectiveness.</p>
