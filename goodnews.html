        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some of its trainers and clothing, following a similar announcement by Adidas, citing the need for "price adjustments" amidst uncertainty surrounding US tariffs. The price increases, effective June 1st, will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100 and other apparel. While Nike did not explicitly mention US tariffs, almost all of its goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's trade policies. The article underscores the broader impact of trade tensions on consumer goods and the strategies companies are employing to navigate these challenges. ()</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team announced a successful ground test of an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber burning RP-3 aviation kerosene, simulating flight conditions at Mach 8. This achievement reignites discussions about the feasibility of hypersonic engine technology, initially proposed by the US Air Force nearly 70 years ago. The ODE concept promises propulsion without moving parts by coupling shock waves with combustion, and NASA scientists theorized it could enable sustained hypersonic cruise from Mach 6 to 16. The article highlights the ongoing global race to develop advanced propulsion systems. ()</p>
