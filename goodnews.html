          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described recent talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, as "constructive and positive," indicating a high probability of a future summit between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. This was the first in-person meeting between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. While acknowledging that significant issues remain to be addressed between the two global powers, Rubio suggested the meeting provided a foundation for future collaboration and problem-solving. The discussion signals a potential de-escalation of tensions and a move towards more direct high-level dialogue.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named "Devin," developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for artificial intelligence on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate Devin into its 12,000-person developer team, initially deploying hundreds of AI agents to handle tasks like updating code. This move signals a shift towards "agentic AI," where programs execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision, potentially boosting productivity significantly. The bank's tech chief envisions a "hybrid workforce" where human engineers supervise AI agents, raising new questions about the future of jobs in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been formally recognized for their exceptional bravery during the tragic knife attack in Southport last year. Sergeant Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive at the scene where an attacker murdered three young girls and injured ten others. Armed with a baton and a Taser, the officers entered the building and confronted the armed assailant, successfully disarming and arresting him. At the awards ceremony, the officers reflected on the profound and lasting impact of the horrific event, while also expressing gratitude for the immense support from the community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has blocked President Trump's executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and undocumented immigrants born in the United States. The ruling issues a nationwide injunction, preventing the policy from being implemented anywhere in the country. This judicial action represents a significant legal setback for a key component of the Trump administration's immigration agenda. The order was based on a reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, a view widely disputed by legal scholars. The case is expected to face further legal battles in higher courts.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially originating over three billion years before our own solar system. This is only the third such object detected from beyond our solar system. A team from Oxford University suggests it likely formed around an ancient star in the Milky Way's "thick disk" and is composed largely of water ice. As it approaches the sun later this year, it is expected to heat up and develop a glowing tail, possibly becoming visible with amateur telescopes, offering a rare glimpse into a primordial part of our galaxy.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between the current US men's national soccer team's preparations for the 2026 World Cup and South Korea's remarkable journey to the semi-finals as co-hosts in 2002. It highlights how South Korean coach Guus Hiddink overcame early struggles and media criticism by focusing on creating an exceptionally fit and cohesive team, a strategy US coach Mauricio Pochettino might emulate. The analysis points out similarities, such as a preparatory period of just over a year and participation in the Gold Cup. However, it also notes key differences, like Hiddink's greater control over domestically-based players, a luxury Pochettino lacks with his Europe-based squad.</p>

          <p>Two advocacy organizations have created a public, crowdsourced database to monitor how the billions of dollars from opioid settlements are being spent by state and local governments. The initiative allows citizens to report suspected cases of waste, fraud, or mismanagement, addressing widespread concern that the "blood money" is being diverted to fill general budget gaps instead of funding addiction and recovery services. The project aims to pressure state attorneys general, who secured the settlements, to provide more robust oversight. Initial entries in the database already include questionable expenditures, such as funds being allocated to a county's road department.</p>

          <p>China's National Health Commission has officially banned a surgical procedure known as LVA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, citing a lack of high-quality evidence for its safety and efficacy. The surgery, which aims to improve the drainage of harmful brain proteins, had gained significant popularity across China, with hundreds of hospitals performing it despite its experimental status. Authorities have now mandated that the procedure be prohibited until proper clinical studies can clearly define its benefits and risks. This move reflects a regulatory effort to curb the use of unproven medical treatments that have proliferated in the private healthcare market.</p>

Experts agree that sirens can be effective, especially for alerting people outdoors in rural areas like Kerr County, but caution they are not a standalone solution. For a warning system to be successful, it must be part of a multi-faceted approach that includes cell phone alerts and public education so people know how to react. The high cost of installation and maintenance, along with the potential for false alarms, are significant hurdles that communities must overcome.</p>

The proposed change was intended to encourage savers to move money into stocks and shares to boost the UK economy. However, the potential backlash from savers, particularly older individuals who are often more risk-averse, has led the Treasury to reconsider.
