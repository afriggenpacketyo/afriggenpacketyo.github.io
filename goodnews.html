          <p>Best Buy has revised its revenue and earnings per share forecasts downward for fiscal year 2026, citing the impact of higher tariffs on consumer electronics. CEO Corie Barry mentioned that the company has already increased prices on some items as a last resort to offset these rising costs, although she did not specify which products were affected. Best Buy is adapting to tariffs by encouraging vendors to diversify manufacturing locations, negotiating lower costs, and adjusting its merchandise mix. The company is focusing on improving customer experience, expanding its marketplace and advertising businesses, and driving efficiency to mitigate pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a surge following a federal court's decision to block certain tariffs imposed by President Trump on China and other trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade invalidated levies on numerous countries, which Trump had previously paused for trade negotiations. The ruling centered on Trump's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the court arguing it does not explicitly permit tariffs. The Trump administration appealed the ruling swiftly, leaving the future of the tariffs uncertain.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report highlighted the company's continued sales growth, particularly in its data center division driven by demand for GPUs in AI software. However, U.S. export controls are limiting Nvidia's potential in China, a market estimated at $50 billion. Cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, remain Nvidia's most significant customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is also seeing surging demand for its GPUs in AI inference, where AI models are served to millions of customers, requiring more computing power for "reasoning."</p>

          <p>MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace is launching a new podcast called "The Best People," featuring conversations with actors, musicians, and thought leaders outside of politics. The podcast aims to reach a wider audience beyond cable TV viewers, particularly working women. Wallace's move into less overtly political territory is unexpected, given her focus on political commentary on MSNBC. Guests will discuss their advocacy issues rather than providing instant political analysis, allowing for more open and candid conversations.</p>

          <p>Savings accounts are a wise choice for building a financial safety net, with high-yield options offering significantly better interest rates. The national average savings account interest rate is 0.42%, but top high-yield accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Choosing a high-yield savings account with an online bank can maximize savings potential, and comparing different accounts can identify the best options. Starting with a small amount and avoiding fees can help individuals at any stage of their financial journey make the most of their savings. (not investment advice)</p>
