          <p>Following deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the ousting of her predecessor, Nepal's interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki has vowed to address the demands of young demonstrators. In her first public address, the former chief justice promised to prioritize good governance and economic equality, acknowledging her appointment was driven by street protests organized by the youth. Karki has committed to a short tenure of no more than six months, during which she will oversee the transition to a new government with elections scheduled for March 5. The recent unrest, which resulted in at least 72 deaths, was initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations.</p>

          <p>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico is concluding her first year in office with approval ratings above 70%, despite facing significant challenges. As the nation's first female leader, she has successfully navigated relations with U.S. President Trump, passed major judicial reforms, and overseen a 25% drop in homicides. While continuing the populist welfare programs of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Sheinbaum has forged her own path with a more diplomatic tone and a tougher security stance against drug cartels. However, she still faces the looming economic and political pressures exerted by the Trump administration, which remains her biggest challenge.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump begins his state visit to the United Kingdom, the event also marks a return to his mother's homeland. Mary Anne MacLeod, Trump's mother, was born in 1912 on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides before immigrating to the United States. She was one of ten siblings who left a life of poverty for opportunities abroad, representing a form of family-based migration that the Trump administration has sought to curtail. This article explores the stark contrast between the president's hardline immigration policies and his own family's story of leaving their homeland for a better life in America.</p>

          <p>Cyberport, a government-run tech incubator in Hong Kong, is testing graphics processing units (GPUs) from mainland Chinese chipmakers for its Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre. The move is a strategic effort to decrease reliance on American firm Nvidia amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and tech restrictions. Cyberport's CEO stated that relying solely on Nvidia is no longer viable and that new procurements will include mainland-produced chips. The center, which currently uses Nvidia's H800 chips, is expanding its computing power and will select a Chinese supplier based on performance and cost after completing its evaluation of four different options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Little Arboreal Ladybird, a species typically found in continental Europe, has been officially recorded in the UK for the first time, with sightings in England's New Forest. Experts believe the hot summer weather facilitated the species' journey across the English Channel, establishing a new colony. This discovery is part of a broader trend of winged insects moving north and colonizing southern England due to warming temperatures. Conservationists view this natural colonization as a positive sign of biodiversity adapting to climate change, suggesting these new arrivals will be crucial for maintaining wildlife diversity in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>Manchester City enters this weekend's derby against Manchester United in an unusually difficult position, trailing their rivals in the league table and coming off two consecutive defeats. Manager Pep Guardiola is grappling with several issues, including integrating numerous new, young players after the departure of key veterans and managing a growing injury list. The goalkeeping situation has also been a point of confusion, with the recent signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma after another keeper was declared the number one. This match is seen as a crucial test for a City side that appears defensively vulnerable and is struggling to find its rhythm this season.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary working father, Robert Andrews Jr., was exposed as the leader of a multi-million pound drug empire after police discovered incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone. The messages revealed Andrews Jr. was selling cocaine and heroin on an industrial scale across south Wales. A covert police operation captured him conducting large-scale drug and cash exchanges in secluded woodland areas. Despite his modest lifestyle, he was funneling profits into a new luxury home and was ultimately sentenced to over 14 years in prison, dismantling a significant organized crime group.</p>

So far, three candidates have secured the necessary nominations to appear on the ballot for the October 24 election: independent Catherine Connolly, former Dublin GAA manager Jim Gavin, and former cabinet minister Heather Humphreys. Other prospective candidates have until late September to gain the required support from parliament members or local authorities.

          <h2>UK Government to Leverage Royal Pageantry During President Trump's State Visit</h2>

          <p>The upcoming state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to the United Kingdom will feature a significant royal charm offensive, designed to flatter the president and strengthen diplomatic ties. The UK government hopes that the elaborate pageantry, including a lavish banquet and ceremonies hosted by King Charles III, will create a positive atmosphere for discussing sensitive issues like trade and the war in Ukraine. Analysts suggest Trump's known admiration for the monarchy provides the King with a unique diplomatic advantage. The carefully orchestrated visit will largely take place within the secure confines of the Windsor estate, away from potential public protests.</p>
