          <p>Following rising tensions and cross-border fire since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, brokered by the United States. The agreement follows a period of heightened military activity, with India accusing Pakistan of attacking multiple locations and moving troops into forward areas. Pakistan has denied involvement in the April attack and claimed retaliatory strikes on India. The ceasefire announcement was first made by President Trump on social media, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming U.S. mediation efforts. Optimism surrounding the ceasefire agreement is tempered by the history of conflict between the two nations, but the agreement represents a step towards de-escalation.</p>

          <p>A preliminary 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck parts of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning, with the epicenter located about 13 miles from Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and parts of western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors. While the USGS initially reported the earthquake as a 3.5 magnitude quake before increasing it to 4.1, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The event serves as a reminder of seismic activity in the region, but the lack of reported damage contributes to a sense of stability following the tremor.</p>

          <p>Personal finance guru Ric Edelman is urging for increased financial literacy among Americans, particularly young investors, who he believes are drawn to risky, get-rich-quick schemes. He argues that the U.S. lacks a strong tradition of encouraging smart personal finance, leading to a situation where younger generations are ill-equipped to make sound financial decisions. Edelman cautions against overly complex financial products and advises young investors to seek information from credible sources, as opposed to platforms like TikTok. While acknowledging the financial challenges faced by young investors, he expresses optimism that they are motivated to achieve financial success due to witnessing their parents' struggles with retirement.</p>
