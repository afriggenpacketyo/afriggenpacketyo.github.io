          <h2>Trump Administration to Offer Stipends for Immigrants to Self-Deport</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 13:24:17 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a program to offer undocumented immigrants $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to return to their home countries voluntarily. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that 'self-deportation' is the safest and most cost-effective option, estimating a 70% savings for taxpayers compared to the cost of arrest, detention, and removal, which averages $17,121 per person. The program utilizes the CBP's 'Home' app, with stipends disbursed upon confirmed arrival in the immigrant's country of origin, and participants will be deprioritized for detention and removal while preparing to depart, potentially improving chances for future legal immigration. The article mentions the program has already been employed by one person who left Chicago to return to Honduras.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its proposal to cut all funding for Head Start, a preschool and child-care program for low-income families, according to a White House spokesperson. While Head Start appears to be spared, other preschool and after-school programs remain at risk due to the White House's broader efforts to slash over $160 billion from the federal budget. The White House's funding proposal includes abolishing preschool development grants and a $75 million grant system that supports child-care services at colleges, raising concerns about the impact on early childhood education and support for low-income parents.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the factors lenders consider when evaluating HELOC applications, such as sufficient home equity, strong credit, low debt-to-income ratio, and stable income. While HELOCs offer lower rates than other borrowing options, lenders have become more cautious, making it essential to meet specific criteria. Homeowners can improve their chances of approval by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant. The article emphasizes the importance of preparation and understanding lender requirements before applying for a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City is ending its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which has purchased over 1,800 properties since 1997 to protect its drinking water, after an independent review concluded that further purchases would have little benefit. The city will focus on the Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring Catskill townships to approve any land transactions, giving them final say over land use. The move comes after years of pressure from the Coalition of Watershed Towns, with concerns about gentrification now threatening the communities.</p>
