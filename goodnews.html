          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, marking a return to large-scale sporting events in the city post-pandemic. However, the event is shadowed by controversy due to the reimposition of mandatory gene testing for female athletes to detect the SRY gene, typically found in males. World Athletics defends the policy as necessary for protecting women's sport, but critics argue the test is unreliable and discriminatory. This has sparked debate amid ongoing "culture wars" surrounding the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup OpenAI has become a major financial catalyst for the technology industry, with its massive spending on cloud infrastructure and custom processors driving stock surges for companies like Oracle, Microsoft, and Broadcom. Oracle's shares saw a historic jump after revealing multibillion-dollar contracts, a significant portion of which is tied to OpenAI's reported commitment to spend $300 billion on computing power. While this spending spree has added trillions to the market caps of its partners, some analysts express concern over the market's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for securing affordable airfare is maintaining flexibility with travel dates. Flying midweek—specifically on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is generally cheaper than traveling on weekends, with potential savings of around 13-14%. The article debunks the myth that the day of the week you book a flight matters significantly, emphasizing instead that the day you fly is the crucial factor. Traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season can also lead to substantial savings.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine has become more complex this year, as the FDA has narrowed approval to specific high-risk groups, including those 65 and older and individuals with certain medical conditions.

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group, a panel of climate change skeptics whose report was widely criticized by independent scientists for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science. The group's report was used to support the Trump administration's efforts to roll back regulations on climate pollution. Environmental groups had filed a lawsuit alleging the group was formed in secret and violated federal law, and they are seeking to have its report legally invalidated.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set for an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 16-18, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The itinerary includes a formal welcome with a royal salute, a visit to Queen Elizabeth II's tomb, and a state banquet. The visit is unusual as second-term U.S. presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The trip is expected to draw protests, with the "Stop Trump" coalition planning a large demonstration in London.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of social decay and rising extremism following German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," uses art to revisit the divisive history of these structures, viewing them as cultural artifacts that raise questions about community, memory, and belonging.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed a bill that would permit colleges and universities in the state to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descended from individuals enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. Proponents argue the measure addresses a legacy of exclusion and is narrowly tailored to focus on lineage, not race, to comply with the state's ban on affirmative action. The bill is part of a broader package of legislation aimed at providing reparations and addressing the lingering effects of slavery and systemic racism in California.</p>

          <p>A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck early Saturday off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region.

          <p>A growing number of small colleges across the U.S., such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reinstating football programs as a strategy to boost enrollment, particularly among men. With women now outnumbering men 60% to 40% at four-year colleges, administrators hope that the sport, along with marching bands and cheerleading, will create a more vibrant campus spirit and attract more male students. While research suggests that any enrollment spike from adding football is often short-lived, these schools see it as a vital tool to address the gender imbalance in higher education.</p>

Crawford, moving up two weight classes, is lauded for his technical skill, adaptability, and ability to exploit an opponent's weaknesses, but faces a significant size and power disadvantage. Álvarez, the natural super-middleweight, is seen as slower than in his prime but possesses formidable power and experience at the higher weight. The matchup presents a classic clash of styles, with Crawford's boxing prowess pitted against Canelo's strength and ring control.</p>
