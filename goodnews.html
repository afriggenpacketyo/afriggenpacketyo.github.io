          <p>The New Jersey gubernatorial election is shaping up to be a closely watched race, with primaries approaching and experts suggesting it could be a bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections. The race features a crowded field of Democratic candidates vying to succeed the term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, including U.S. Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli, who has shifted his stance on Trump over the years. Issues such as immigration, housing affordability, and Trump's influence are central to the campaigns. </p>

          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accused the administration of a "campaign of retribution" after Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification was revoked, halting the university's ability to enroll international students. A federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university. The Trump administration has explained its attacks on Harvard as an effort to combat antisemitism and confront liberal biases on campus. </p>

          <p>Southern California Edison has agreed to pay $82.5 million to cover costs and damages from the 2020 Bobcat fire, in what federal officials are calling a record settlement for one of the largest blazes in Los Angeles County. Federal officials allege the fire ignited when trees not properly maintained by Edison came into contact with power lines. The settlement comes as Edison seeks to raise customer rates by 10% to pay for wildfire mitigation. The federal government had filed a lawsuit seeking damages in excess of $121 million for the cost of extinguishing the fire and the resulting damage. </p>

          <p>A court in Paris found eight people guilty in connection with the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian, where she was bound and robbed at gunpoint of millions of dollars in jewelry. The court sentenced them to three to eight years in prison, with the sentences mostly or entirely suspended, citing the advanced age and health issues of many defendants. Kardashian testified earlier this month that she had feared for her life during the robbery. Most of her stolen jewelry, including a $4 million diamond engagement ring, was not recovered. </p>

Barrack stated this will allow the Syrian government to restore peace, security, and prosperity, working with regional partners including T√ºrkiye and the Gulf.

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling prevented the nation‚Äôs first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, but conservatives may still achieve their goals through a school voucher program. The House passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program, setting aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to pay for K-12 private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning. This bill could bring vouchers to liberal states and is expected to reach as many as 1 million students nationwide, with much of the money going to religious education. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a tax write-off for donations to nonprofits that grant private-education scholarships. </p>

          <p>California Assemblymember Catherine Stefani has introduced Assembly Bill 381, aimed at preventing human trafficking and forced labor. The bill seeks to ensure California does not ignore the human suffering behind the products it buys with public funds, as the state spends nearly $19 billion on items like uniforms and cleaning products, some of which may come from companies using forced labor. AB 381 would update California's rules to match federal laws against human trafficking, requiring companies doing business with the state to have a plan to stop trafficking, train their workers, and ensure their subcontractors do the same. The bill would modify existing California law to align with federal anti-trafficking measures, and aims to ensure companies doing business with the state follow basic and sensible measures to prevent the exploitation of workers. </p>

TJX has a vast network of over 21,000 vendors across more than 100 countries, enabling it to source products at the best possible prices.

          <p>Financial futurist Dave Nadig warns of an unprecedented surge in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to a change from the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing traditional mutual fund managers to offer an ETF share class of their existing funds. The number of ETFs is expected to reach over 7,000 within a month, with as many as 3,000 new launches. Nadig advises investors to do more homework on what's out there, as the new funds will lead to an "enormous burden on individual investors and advisors to wade through that stuff." Most of the new products are expected to be traditional asset allocation products, but investors should be wary of the history of active managers failing to beat the index.
