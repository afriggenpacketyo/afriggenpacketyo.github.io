          <p>Individuals facing terminal illnesses are curating personal playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days. This practice is gaining recognition in palliative care for its therapeutic benefits, as music can evoke powerful memories and reduce anxiety. Experts note that hearing is one of the last senses to fade, allowing music to reach patients even when they are unconscious, and these playlists also offer solace to grieving loved ones after a person has passed away. The article highlights personal stories and expert advice on creating meaningful end-of-life playlists.</p>

Investors are closely watching for China's upcoming decision on its loan prime rates, which are widely expected to remain unchanged. Major indices in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all opened higher, reflecting optimism after the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. The stability in U.S. equity futures suggests a continued positive sentiment as the new trading week begins in Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, raising children with exceptional social skills involves more than teaching manners. The key is modeling behavior at home by creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection. The article details nine specific practices, including talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy, fostering genuine confidence, and teaching how to repair relationships after conflict. By validating feelings and allowing children to solve problems, parents can help them develop the emotional intelligence necessary for healthy, real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>The UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, Pat McFadden, has stated that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address the rising costs and better support individuals back into employment. Despite the government recently scrapping a controversial cost-cutting policy for disability benefits, McFadden insists that reform is ongoing. The government aims to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits who currently have no work requirements. McFadden argues the current system creates an unhealthy "binary divide" between being fit for work or not, and changes are needed for both fiscal and social well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists on Nantucket is pioneering a novel approach to reduce the spread of Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population. Since these mice are the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, the goal is to create mice that are immune, thereby breaking the transmission cycle to ticks. The project, led by an MIT associate professor, involves using CRISPR technology to create a "heritable immunization" that is passed down through generations. The team is engaging in extensive community outreach to ensure public support and address ecological concerns before releasing any engineered mice into the wild.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to its inaugural class, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing "fearless pursuit of truth" and ideological diversity. Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat the self-censorship and lack of viewpoint diversity they see on other campuses. With a curriculum rooted in Western civilization and a bare-bones campus model to keep tuition free for now, UATX is attracting students who seek rigorous debate. Critics, however, question whether it will become a right-wing institution, given its prominent conservative backers.</p>

          <p>Each year, a unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes an extraordinary 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. These butterflies can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, allowing them to complete the arduous journey. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their reproduction. Conservation efforts, such as creating "Monarch Waystations" and protecting their wintering grounds in Mexico, are underway to help preserve this mysterious and vital natural phenomenon.</p>

          <p>MP Zarah Sultana has stated she is "determined to reconcile" with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn following a public falling out over the formation of a new left-wing party. Sultana, who had previously accused Corbyn's camp of being a "sexist boys' club" and threatened legal action, announced she would no longer be pursuing a defamation case. The dispute emerged after conflicting messages were sent to supporters regarding party membership sign-ups. In her latest statement, Sultana expressed respect for Corbyn and a desire to move forward in a unified way, suggesting the new party's inaugural conference will proceed as planned.</p>

In addition to receiving signed bats and baseballs from the Angels superstar, the fan, named Alberto, asked if he could play catch with Trout on the field. Trout readily agreed, creating a memorable moment for the fan and his family. The home run made Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the 400-homer mark and the 20th to do so with a single franchise.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two spectacular defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young saved an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch after the ball was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed up in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets, who are now tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wild-card spot.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization, which has proven fruitless. He argued that halting the North's current production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually offers clear benefits for regional and global security. The statement signals a significant pragmatic shift in Seoul's approach to its northern neighbor.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment the school's principal discovered a black bear hiding inside a dumpster. The principal, James Marsh, was unlocking the container when the bear's snout appeared, prompting him to quickly retreat as the bear climbed out and ran off in the opposite direction. The incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of human-wildlife encounters, which are becoming more common as animal habitats shrink. Experts advise securing all food and trash sources to avoid attracting wildlife into populated areas.</p>
