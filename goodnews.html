        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryan Ferguson, wrongfully convicted of murder in 2005 and incarcerated for nearly a decade, has been awarded over $43 million by a Missouri judge. This follows a 2014 federal civil rights lawsuit where Ferguson was initially awarded $11 million. The recent judgment is against the city's insurer, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, after the officers involved could only pay $2.7 million. Ferguson's attorney stated that he was thrilled with the outcome, nearly as much as when his conviction was overturned. The officers involved will receive a percentage of the award.</p>

          <p>Meta is reportedly hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, escalating the competition for AI talent.

Gross and Friedman will join Meta to work on AI products, with Meta acquiring a stake in their venture capital firm, NFDG.

This exceeded Luo's previous livestreaming attempts, highlighting the potential of AI in sales and marketing.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from tying states' transportation funds to immigration enforcement. The judge granted an injunction, stating that the states were likely to succeed in their claims against the Department of Transportation's policy. The lawsuit, filed by Democratic state attorneys general, argued that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage to coerce states into adhering to its immigration agenda. The ruling prevents the administration from imposing immigration-enforcement conditions on funding for transportation projects.</p>
