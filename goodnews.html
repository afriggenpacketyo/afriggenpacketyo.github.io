          <p>Cisco announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that slightly surpassed analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue, with revenue growing 7.6% year-over-year to $14.67 billion. The company also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting revenue between $59 billion and $60 billion, aligning with market expectations. A significant driver of this performance is the growing demand for AI infrastructure, with Cisco reporting $800 million in AI-related orders from web companies in the quarter alone. Despite the positive results and strong AI pipeline, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, enrolling in a debt relief program can provide a structured path forward, but proper preparation is crucial for success. This article outlines four essential steps to take before committing to a program, starting with a comprehensive review of all debts, income, and expenses to understand the full financial picture. It is also vital to research and understand how different debt relief options, like settlement or consolidation, will impact personal finances, including credit scores and potential tax liabilities. Finally, creating a realistic monthly budget and pausing all new credit activity are critical for ensuring consistent payments and achieving long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Anticipate Federal Reserve Interest Rate Cut Amid Economic Slowdown and Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 16:26:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to implement a quarter-point interest rate cut at its next meeting, driven by signs of a cooling labor market and lower-than-expected inflation data. A recent jobs report showed a significant slowdown, prompting concerns about a potential economic downturn that a rate cut could help prevent. The decision is complicated by potential tariff-induced inflation, but recent figures have eased some of those fears, giving the Fed more room to act. The central bank also continues to face public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for lower rates to boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Liverpool is reportedly close to completing a deal to sign 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of approximately £26 million. The center-back has become a primary target for the club as it looks to strengthen its defensive lineup for the upcoming season. In addition to the Leoni signing, Liverpool is also in ongoing negotiations with Crystal Palace for their captain, England international Marc Guehi. The potential acquisitions highlight a significant summer spending spree for Liverpool, which could exceed £400 million if all targeted deals are finalized.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, while major technology stocks like those in the "Magnificent 7" declined. This market rotation is fueled by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on borrowed capital for their operations and expansion. The potential for a rate cut, supported by recent weaker-than-expected jobs data and cooling inflation, has traders pricing in an almost certain likelihood of the Fed easing its monetary policy.

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its grocery business by rolling out same-day delivery for fresh food items like meat, produce, and eggs to more than 1,000 cities and towns across the U.S. The company plans to extend the service to at least 2,300 locations by the end of the year, aiming to encourage more customers to purchase groceries through its platform. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25. This major push into fresh food delivery represents an escalation of competition with rivals like Walmart and Instacart, whose stock prices fell following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. Previously, the discount on most food items was only available during the holiday season. The move, which affects approximately 1.6 million U.S. employees, comes as rising tariffs spark renewed concerns about inflation and higher consumer prices. In a memo to employees, the company stated the expansion was one of its most requested benefits. The expanded discount could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales and help with employee retention in a competitive labor market.</p>

          <p>The Habit Burger & Grill is intensifying its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard near Los Angeles International Airport that trolls its competitor's ranking in a national poll. After beating In-N-Out in USA Today's "best fast-food burger" list, Habit altered the sign to show its rival dropping from #2 to #4. The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's recent eastward expansion and its CEO's personal move to Tennessee, with Habit emphasizing its proud California roots. This asymmetric marketing battle highlights the competitive landscape of California's fast-food culture, pitting the two Irvine-based chains against each other.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners have reached a record $17.8 trillion in total home equity, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable funds. The average homeowner now holds around $213,000 in accessible equity, which can be borrowed through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. To calculate available equity, homeowners can subtract their current mortgage balance from their home's market value, with lenders typically allowing them to borrow up to 80% of that amount. Homeowners are cautioned to borrow responsibly as their property serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers with a large sum like $50,000, high-yield savings and money market accounts offer attractive, flexible alternatives to more restrictive options like CDs. This article calculates the potential one-year earnings for a $50,000 deposit in both account types using current top rates. At a 4.40% APY, a money market account would earn $2,200 in a year, while a high-yield savings account at 4.35% would earn $2,175. While the money market account currently yields slightly more, the difference is minimal, and savers are encouraged to shop for the best available rates, which are often found at online banks.

He advises that as AI tools become more integrated into the workplace, the ability to think creatively, make nuanced judgments, and adapt to new technologies will be what employers value most. Garman emphasizes that this skill can be developed in any field of study and is crucial for curating and refining the output of AI systems. He also highlights communication and adaptability as essential skills, noting that despite technological advancements, customers will still value human interaction and insight.</p>
