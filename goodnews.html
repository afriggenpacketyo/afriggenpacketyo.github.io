          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has surpassed Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual, with his net worth reaching an estimated $393 billion. The shift was driven by a massive 40% surge in Oracle's stock price following a highly optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business. The company has seen soaring demand for its data centers from AI firms, contrasting with a recent decline in the stock value of Musk's company, Tesla.</p>

          <p>This article examines the tactical principles established by manager Thomas Tuchel during his first six games with the England national football team, culminating in a decisive 5-0 victory against Serbia. It highlights his emphasis on a more aggressive, risk-taking attacking style, utilizing "double width" with full-backs and wingers to stretch defenses. Tuchel has also focused on selecting players who fit his system, such as those with a natural tendency for off-the-ball runs, and leveraging club-level partnerships to build chemistry quickly.</p>

          <p>Amazon has officially launched its robotaxi service, Zoox, offering free public rides on the Las Vegas strip five years after acquiring the company for $1.3 billion. Zoox's vehicles are purpose-built without a steering wheel or pedals, featuring a carriage-style seating arrangement for four passengers. The launch marks Amazon's entry into a competitive market dominated by Alphabet's Waymo, with Zoox planning future expansions to San Francisco, Austin, and Miami.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has overturned the 1964 conviction of Choi Mal-ja, who was found guilty of grievous bodily harm for biting off part of her sexual attacker's tongue while defending herself. Now 79, Choi was inspired by the #MeToo movement to seek a retrial, where the court ruled her actions constituted justifiable self-defense. The landmark decision reverses a decades-old ruling that had punished a victim of sexual violence while giving her attacker a suspended sentence.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of inflation at the wholesale level, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrary to economists' expectations of an increase. This marks the third time this year the gauge has shown deflation, feeding market speculation that the Federal Reserve will implement a rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The report indicated falling prices in the services sector and only a marginal increase in goods prices, providing positive news on inflation fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

The contest's tight timetable has drawn some criticism, with Phillipson's position as the only cabinet member running potentially giving her an advantage in securing support from fellow MPs.</p>

The samples, which await a future return mission to Earth for conclusive analysis, contain organic carbon and specks of iron compounds that on Earth are byproducts of microorganisms. While researchers caution that non-biological processes could also be responsible, they describe the finding as the most compelling candidate yet in the search for past life on Mars.</p>
