          <p>Sovereignty emerged victorious over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes, held in Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of their Kentucky Derby finish. This win makes Sovereignty the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont. Journalism, who had won the Preakness, finished second, while Baeza took third, mirroring the Derby results. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race distance to 1 1/4 miles. </p>

          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia, Sona or Tusona, is gaining attention for challenging myths about African literacy and knowledge systems. Originally taught and maintained by women, Sona involves geometric patterns that convey mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions for community life. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to revive and document this cultural heritage, which was nearly erased by colonialism. The project uses social media to showcase artifacts and knowledge that highlight women's roles in pre-colonial Zambian society. </p>

          <p>The EU is considering standardizing hand luggage rules to address passenger confusion and inconsistent policies among budget airlines. The proposed changes include guaranteed free personal items of a specified size for EU-based airlines, potentially affecting UK passengers traveling to or from EU destinations. This move follows complaints of inconsistent baggage rules and hefty fees for oversized bags, with the EU aiming to add clarity to existing regulations. While some consumer groups argue the proposals don't go far enough, budget airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and keep fares low. </p>

This approach offers a new strategy for tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which cause millions of deaths annually. </p>

Since mid-March, officials have been undergoing checks to ensure compliance with rules covering official events, buildings, and travel. The campaign, running since 2012, aims to improve the ruling party‚Äôs image, stamp out corruption, and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest the measures are also intended to ensure resources are used wisely in China's rivalry with the United States and to identify politically loyal cadres for promotion. </p>
