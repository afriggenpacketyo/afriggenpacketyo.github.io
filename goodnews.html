          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to resume trade talks between the U.S. and China. The two leaders had a 90-minute phone call that focused primarily on trade, leading to a positive conclusion for both countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in the renewed discussions. This development comes after strained trade relations and disagreements over issues such as critical mineral exports and restrictions on Chinese student visas and semiconductors.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on the phone to discuss trade, with Trump noting that Xi invited him to visit China. Trump said the call, which lasted about one and a half hours, resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries, and that U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams will be meeting shortly. The conversation is a significant development amid a tense tariff standoff between the U.S. and China. Trump has accused China of violating a deal negotiated by top officials in Geneva last month, while Chinese leaders have expressed concerns about U.S. restrictions on tech exports and student visas.

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25 basis point interest rate cut and lowered its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the ECB's 2% target in May, reaching 1.9%. The ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025, compared to a previous forecast of 2.3%. This decision comes at a critical time for the euro zone economy, with businesses and policymakers facing increasing uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions and potential impacts from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its 5.7-liter V-8 Hemi engine for its Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a previous decision to discontinue the powertrain. The move comes as EV adoption has been slower than expected and as the Trump administration seeks to unwind initiatives pushing the auto industry away from internal combustion engines. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted that canceling the Hemi engine was a mistake and expects it to represent a significant portion of Ram 1500 sales. The Hemi will be offered as an option alongside the more efficient twin-turbocharged Hurricane engine. </p>
