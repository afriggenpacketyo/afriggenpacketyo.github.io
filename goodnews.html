          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a proprietary cannabis oil blend was more effective for treating chronic low back pain than both a placebo and traditional opioids. The research, published in Nature Medicine, showed that patients using the cannabis tincture experienced better pain relief and fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to those on opioids. While these "groundbreaking" findings could provide a new evidence base for medical cannabis, the specific full-spectrum oil, VER-01, is not yet approved in the U.S. and will require further trials.</p>

          <p>Shares of steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs surged after the company announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earth minerals at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that this initiative aligns with the national strategy for critical mineral independence, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain. The move is significant amid heightened trade tensions and U.S. efforts to secure domestic sources for these minerals, which are crucial for defense, electric vehicles, and other high-tech applications.

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. Industry sales and production have held up better than expected, leading some firms to upgrade their outlooks from negative to neutral. However, uncertainty persists due to slowing consumer income growth, potential tariff impacts being passed to consumers, and major shifts in electric vehicle adoption strategies by automakers like General Motors. The industry is navigating a delicate balance between these pressures and stable consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investment commentator Jim Cramer expressed optimism for several key stocks, highlighting Boeing and Starbucks. He noted that Boeing's official approval to increase 737 MAX production is a positive step toward stronger free cash flow, turning it into a "cashflow story." Cramer also recommended buying Starbucks stock, citing confidence in the company's turnaround plan and the significant, previously underestimated value of its China business. His analysis suggests that strategic changes and new products could position the coffee giant for a very strong performance in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is formulating its next five-year plan at a critical economic juncture, facing the challenge of balancing two competing priorities. On one hand, Beijing is prioritizing massive investment in high-tech industries like semiconductors to achieve technological sovereignty and resilience amid geopolitical competition with the U.S. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to stimulate its long-neglected domestic consumption to prop up a sputtering economy. Analysts suggest that for now, industrial policy will likely take precedence, leaving fewer resources to address the gloomy mood among Chinese consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Due to soaring cocoa prices, McVitie's has altered the recipe for its iconic Penguin and Club bars, reducing the cocoa content to the point where they can no longer be legally classified as chocolate. The products are now described as "chocolate flavour" because the coating contains less than the 20% cocoa solids required by UK regulations. The brand's owner, Pladis, made the change to manage rising costs driven by poor harvests in West Africa, stating that consumer testing showed the new coating delivers the same taste despite using cheaper alternatives like palm or shea butter.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Japan's health ministry has approved the sale of an emergency contraceptive pill without a prescription, a significant step for reproductive health access in the country. The manufacturer, ASKA Pharmaceutical, stated the move will empower women, though the pill will be sold as a "medicine requiring guidance," meaning it must be taken in a pharmacist's presence. This decision follows years of debate and a successful trial sale, overcoming previous official concerns and aligning Japan with over 90 other countries where the "morning-after" pill is already available over-the-counter.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, stated that the ongoing government shutdown is "likely to end sometime this week." He suggested that moderate Democrats might soon break the impasse over a funding bill, which has been stalled by disputes over Affordable Care Act subsidies. Hassett also warned that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. Republicans have blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the shutdown, while Democrats point to polls showing more voters hold the GOP responsible.</p>

          <p>An executive coach and author provides five practical strategies for effectively working with a controlling or micromanaging boss. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques are to get ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and to use the "yes, and..." method to validate their feedback while still asserting one's own perspective. These methods are designed to conserve energy and reduce frustration in a challenging work dynamic.</p>

          <p>The election of moderate, left-leaning Tufan Erhurman as the new leader of the Turkish Cypriot community represents a significant political shift. Erhurman, who won with a decisive 62.8% of the vote, campaigned on a platform of returning to reunification talks based on a federal solution, a direct rejection of the two-state policy favored by his predecessor and Turkey's President Erdoğan. His victory is seen as a message in favor of preserving the community's secular identity and redefining its relationship with Ankara. The result has been welcomed by Greek Cypriot leaders as an opportunity to restart long-stalled peace negotiations.</p>

Beyond the bouts, the rikishi charmed the public with their cultural excursions, including recreating The Beatles' "Abbey Road" album cover, enjoying fish and chips, and touring city landmarks.
