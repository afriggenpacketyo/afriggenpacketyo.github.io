          <p>Social media influencer turned boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Chavez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father, boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. While Paul showcased improved boxing skills, the victory against an uninspired, aging opponent raises continued questions about the legitimacy of his professional boxing career. Following the win, Paul called out current world champions, signaling his ambition for a future title shot.</p>

          <p>The French government is leading a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment into satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move, which makes the French state Eutelsat's largest shareholder, is part of a broader European push for technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, industry experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing the massive disparity in scale, as Eutelsat's LEO constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. The company is seen as better positioned to serve security-sensitive and enterprise markets rather than the mass consumer market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, it is now a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance, the island's close proximity to and economic reliance on the mainland city of Xiamen reveal the practical limits of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. The island's current state reflects a complex blend of historical conflict and modern interdependence, challenging simple narratives from either side.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 miles per hour. This start was his third since returning from elbow surgery, showing an aggressive approach by attacking the strike zone. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani was hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>A new law has gone into effect in France banning smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and other public areas. The regulations are part of a national plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to protect non-smokers, especially children, from the effects of passive smoking. The ban, which includes fines for violations after an initial grace period, does not apply to the terraces of bars and restaurants. With over 30% of adults still smoking, France has one of Europe's higher smoking rates, though recent data indicates a gradual decline.</p>

Organizers have adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" to reflect the current climate.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, temperatures in cities are often significantly higher than in surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, slowly releasing it as heat, which raises urban temperatures, especially at night. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water sources provide natural cooling through evaporation. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, the world's growing urban populations are expected to bear the brunt of this effect.</p>
