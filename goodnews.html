          <p>Ofcom has initiated investigations into two pornographic websites suspected of failing to comply with the UK's new child safety regulations. The regulator alleges that these sites, including one offering a "nudifying" service, have not provided sufficient details on how they prevent children from accessing their platforms. Under the Online Safety Act, all websites featuring pornographic material must implement robust age-checking methods by July. Non-compliant firms may face substantial fines, and the Children's Commissioner has advocated for a total ban on AI apps that can create sexually explicit images of children.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has appeared on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report a series of high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri admitted to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000 for not disclosing the sales, which totaled ¬£140,000, between October 2020 and December 2021. The court heard that Ojiri was aware of Ahmad's alleged terrorism links and that Ramp Gallery, which Ojiri founded, did not properly act on compliance advice. Ojiri has been granted bail and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey in June.</p>

          <p>Despite rising tariffs on imports, Keen, a U.S.-based footwear company, has pledged not to increase prices for customers. The company has diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and also partners with manufacturers in other countries. This strategy allows the company to mitigate the impact of tariffs and maintain price stability, while other retailers are raising prices due to increased costs.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the recent volatility in the stock market, driven by trade war announcements and reversals, demonstrates the difficulty and costliness of timing the market. Despite initial market reactions to political events, the S&P 500 has largely returned to pre-election levels, highlighting the futility of making sweeping portfolio changes based on short-term news. The author emphasizes the importance of sticking to a disciplined investment strategy, making small adjustments in response to market conditions rather than attempting to predict major shifts.</p>

          <p>The article argues that current AI chatbots, designed to mimic human interaction and often displaying sycophantic behavior, are a poor application of AI's potential. Instead of seeking opinions from AI, the author proposes viewing AI as a "cultural technology" that connects users to the collective knowledge and insights of others. By shifting the focus from AI-generated opinions to AI-facilitated exploration of diverse perspectives, the author suggests a more productive and enriching approach to utilizing these systems. The goal is to broaden knowledge and understanding rather than simply reaffirm existing beliefs.</p>
