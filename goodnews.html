          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces the potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. Amidst escalating Sino-U.S. tensions, Beijing might use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo, often revealing such decisions during high-level bilateral talks. Despite the pandas' historical role as symbols of friendship and economic drivers through tourism, their diplomatic weight may be diminishing. Experts suggest that China's agreement with Tokyo to resume importing Japanese marine products signals an effort to improve relations, potentially supported by a new panda allocation during a future meeting between Japanese and Chinese leaders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence expands rapidly, researchers are uncovering more instances of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech, copyright infringements, and sexual content. The emergence of these issues is exacerbated by insufficient regulations and inadequate testing of AI models. Researchers suggest evaluating risks in AI through practices like red teaming, where individuals test AI systems to uncover potential harm. They advocate for opening testing to third parties, such as users, journalists, and ethical hackers, and adopting standardized AI flaw reports to better understand and manage the risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases to Avoid for Better Communication with Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who avoid defiance in their children do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that encourages cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries. Phrases such as "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The study suggests alternative phrases that foster respect, emotional safety, and involvement, leading to children who are more trusting, self-regulating, and emotionally resilient.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro injections, aimed at aiding weight loss, will be accessible at GP surgeries in England starting today, but only for individuals meeting stringent criteria. NHS England plans a phased approach to reach those most in need, manage GP workload, and conserve NHS resources. The initial eligibility includes individuals with a BMI of 40 or higher (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and four out of five specific health conditions. While some GP practices caution that few patients will immediately qualify, the move is expected to significantly impact the lives of those with obesity and severe health issues.</p>

He vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, despite facing potential threats and detention. Khalil's ordeal involved being detained by ICE agents and missing the birth of his child, and the Trump administration plans to appeal the order for his release.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. Government subsidies and long-term planning have enabled China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production. The Chinese government spent an estimated $231 billion developing the EV industry from 2009 to 2023. Chinese EV makers are now looking to expand sales overseas, driven by fierce competition and innovation.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a clinic offering ketamine as an alternative treatment for severe depression, particularly for patients unresponsive to traditional treatments. This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy, combining intravenous ketamine infusions with psychotherapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to publish a new report on psychedelics, including updated information on ketamine, later this year.</p>
