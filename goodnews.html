          <h2>Starlink Satellite Internet Service Experiences Widespread Outage Following T-Mobile Service Rollout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:42:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service suffered a significant network outage, with over 60,000 users reporting issues on Thursday. Elon Musk apologized for the disruption on his social media platform, X, and a company engineer later stated that service was mostly recovered after about 2.5 hours. The outage occurred shortly after T-Mobile announced the public availability of its new satellite-powered service, which utilizes the Starlink network to provide connectivity in remote areas. It was not immediately clear if the launch of the new T-Mobile service was related to the network failure.</p>

          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu has advanced to the quarter-finals of the Washington Open after a decisive straight-sets victory over four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. The 2021 US Open winner delivered a dominant 6-4 6-2 performance and is set to become the new British number one. Raducanu is also succeeding in the doubles competition, having reached the semi-finals with her partner. However, it was a disappointing day for her male compatriots, as both Cameron Norrie and defending champion Dan Evans were knocked out of the men's singles tournament.</p>

Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to enter the race with an endorsement from President Trump, following Lara Trump's decision not to run. On the Democratic side, popular former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also reportedly planning to announce his bid next week.

          <p>A vehicle fire in an Arlington, Virginia, parking lot resulted in a dramatic and powerful explosion that was captured on camera. The Arlington Fire & EMS department explained the event was a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) caused by the car's fuel tank rupturing.

Officials have deemed the incident non-suspicious and are investigating the initial cause of the fire, reminding the public to stay clear of such situations.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is launching a test of 10 new beverages in 500 U.S. locations, aiming to attract younger consumers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new lineup, which includes items like a Strawberry Watermelon Refresher and Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew, is inspired by learnings from its recently closed CosMc's drink-focused spinoff chain. Instead of operating separate stores, the company will integrate these new drinks into its main restaurant menu, capitalizing on the growing demand for specialty beverages. This move is part of a broader strategy to boost sales and appeal to inflation-conscious customers.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" and "absolutely convinced" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Despite historical trends showing the president's party typically loses seats, Johnson believes the GOP has opportunities due to Democratic-held seats in Trump-won districts and demographic shifts. He also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting voters will feel its economic benefits despite current low approval ratings. Johnson dismissed polling that suggests public disapproval of the tax and spending bill as the result of "misinformation." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is surging, with the number of AI-related job postings growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years. A Brookings Institution report shows that as more companies integrate AI, they are seeking expertise in both advanced roles like AI engineering and more general positions that utilize AI tools. These jobs are often associated with higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles without an AI requirement. While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, AI-related employment is expanding beyond tech hubs into various sectors. (not investment advice)</p>
