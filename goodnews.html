          <p>China's Victory Day parade, attended by leaders like Russia's Putin and North Korea's Kim, served as a significant message primarily aimed at the Global South. The event projected an image of China as an alternative to Western partnerships, offering diplomatic legitimacy without requiring adherence to Western-dominated frameworks or reforms. This display aimed to reassure domestic audiences, signal limitations to Washington's sanctions, and present an "axis of the excluded" to middle powers seeking military development without Cold War entanglements.</p>

Oracle is leveraging its cloud infrastructure for AI workloads, with projected revenue growth from $18 billion to $144 billion in four years. CoreWeave, specializing in AI cloud platforms, has seen revenue triple and is backed by Nvidia. Broadcom, a networking leader, is benefiting from surging demand for customized chips and networking equipment from AI customers, including a recent $10 billion order. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian argues that China must develop its own knowledge system for artificial intelligence, moving beyond Western-centric social science theories that fail to explain non-Western civilizations. He expresses concern over "intellectual colonialism" in the AI era, suggesting that Western methods, based on Western practices, are inadequate for understanding Confucian, Islamic, or Indian societies. The article advocates for China to embrace its secular civilization to play a proper role in the international order and build a distinct approach to AI development.</p>
