          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has announced plans to tighten oversight of key manufacturing sectors, including electric vehicles and solar power. The move aims to combat excessive internal competition, a phenomenon known as 'neijuan,' and to phase out outdated production capacity through upgraded standards. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to stabilize crowded industries and promote high-tech consumer goods to stimulate domestic demand. The state's market regulator also pledged to address low-quality, cut-price competition to ensure healthier market development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip designer Rebellions has secured a new investment from Samsung as it pursues a funding round of up to $200 million. The startup, which merged with rival Sapeon last year, is positioning itself as a key domestic competitor to Nvidia in the artificial intelligence hardware market. Rebellions specializes in chips for AI inferencing and is collaborating with Samsung's foundry to manufacture its next-generation 'Rebel' chip. This strategic backing from major Korean firms is intended to support the company's planned initial public offering and its ambitions for global expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysts Suggest UK Could Be an Unforeseen Beneficiary of New EU-US Trade Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 04:42:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent EU-U.S. trade agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods, could unexpectedly benefit the United Kingdom, which faces a lower 10% rate. Economists suggest this tariff differential could make British exports to the U.S. more competitive, potentially boosting trade and encouraging EU-based manufacturers to shift operations to the UK to protect their profit margins. While the overall impact remains uncertain, the 5% advantage offers a potential silver lining for the British economy in a challenging global trade environment. The deal averted even higher potential tariffs, which also helps the UK by stabilizing its largest trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, according to research from Canalys. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, while China's share fell from 61% to 25%. This significant supply chain shift is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to move its manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainty. The move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers diversifying their production bases to mitigate geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays has reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, beating analyst expectations and prompting the announcement of a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely fueled by its investment banking division, which saw a 10% year-on-year increase in income as it capitalized on market volatility. This result reflects a broader trend among major banks that have benefited from heightened trading activity in currency and stock markets. The bank stated it remains on track to achieve the objectives of its three-year strategic plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly placed Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko at the top of its striker wishlist for the current transfer window. However, the club's hierarchy acknowledges that any significant new signings will likely depend on their ability to offload unwanted players first to generate funds. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa has stated it is not interested in selling the 29-year-old Watkins, and Newcastle is also reportedly pursuing the 22-year-old Sesko. United feels Villa's stance on Watkins might soften closer to the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese experts, China must adopt a more proactive role in shaping international discourse to counteract what they describe as a historically dominant Western narrative. They argue that Beijing should leverage its own cultural symbols and deepen engagement with scholars across Asia to build a consensus-based regional voice. This call for greater 'discourse power' comes as global dynamics shift, with emerging economies seeking a more prominent role in global governance. The experts suggest that China should take the lead in defining rules and norms in new fields to align its soft power with its economic growth.</p>
