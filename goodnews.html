          <h2>Nintendo Anticipates Strong Switch 2 Sales Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Nintendo projects selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking its initial sales forecast for the console successor. While fourth-quarter revenue and profit fell due to anticipation for the new console, Nintendo's Switch sales reached 10.8 million units for the year. The company's forecasts account for current U.S. tariff rates, with potential price adjustments and demand decreases if tariffs increase, which would hit profits by tens of billions of yen. Despite conservative forecasts, analysts anticipate strong Switch 2 performance, supported by a large existing user base.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the cause of a fire at an electrical substation that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport in March remains undetermined. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) found that a transformer disconnected and caught fire, causing a power outage. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence of suspicious activity. The shutdown affected over 270,000 journeys, prompting an urgent investigation. Power was restored to the terminals hours before flights resumed, but the airport's management has faced criticism for the extended shutdown.</p>

          <p>Footage of a Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened New Zealand species, laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time. The video was taken at a conservation facility where rangers care for the snails to save them from extinction. The species, endemic to New Zealand, faces threats from habitat loss due to mining. Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites and can reproduce when encased in a hard shell.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a major shipping company, reported better-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but revised its global container market volume growth forecast downward due to rising U.S.-China trade tariffs. The company kept its 2025 profit guidance unchanged but cited increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The results reflect the shipping industry's navigation of a complex tariff landscape caused by the Trump administration's trade policies. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that strong demand contributed to the solid results.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries amid ongoing tariff disputes. The agreement would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, later pausing them for negotiations. The deal aims to foster closer economic cooperation, potentially lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. The announcement follows Trump's recent downplaying of the necessity for trade deals.</p>

          <p>California beaches are experiencing a bloom of Velella velella, also known as by-the-wind sailors, which are washing ashore in large numbers. These small, glittering blue creatures are typically found on the open sea and are harmless to humans, though their stinging cells can be irritating. The phenomenon is part of the spring transition, with winds shifting and pushing the Velella towards the coast. These events are thought to be linked to rising ocean temperatures.</p>
