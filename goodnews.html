          <p>Singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition involving a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid. The 76-year-old Grammy winner's condition has been exacerbated by recent performances, leading to issues with hearing, vision, and balance. NPH, typically seen in older adults, can cause gait issues, urinary incontinence, and cognitive difficulties.

Trump also stated that critical race theory would no longer be taught at military academies and claimed a new peacetime recruiting record, while experts suggest this is a result of recruitment reforms introduced during the previous administration.</p>
