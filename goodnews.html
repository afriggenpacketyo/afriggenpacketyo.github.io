        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared the cessation of U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to foster stability and peace in the country. This decision marks a shift towards restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria after over a decade of strained ties. Syria has faced severe sanctions since 2004, intensified in 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings, and further complicated by civil war and terrorist activities. The move follows the toppling of the Assad regime in 2024 and aims to support the new transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa and facilitate humanitarian aid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, raising the prospect of their release after over 30 years for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation in prison and support from corrections officials as factors in his decision. The brothers expressed remorse for their actions and apologized to their family during the hearing. While the district attorney opposed resentencing, the judge's decision now places their fate in the hands of California's governor and parole board officials, marking a significant turn in a case that has captivated public attention for decades.</p>

          <p>The UK government intends to move 12,000 civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. This initiative includes closing 11 London offices and opening new government campuses in Manchester and Aberdeen, aiming to save ¬£94 million annually by 2032. The government plans to locate 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030, with regional campuses focused on digital innovation, AI, and energy. The relocation is expected to bring ¬£729 million to the local economy by 2030, though some critics argue the plan is not serious about reducing the size of the state.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth, but face challenges in finding qualified money managers due to trust issues and competition with larger financial institutions. The demand for personalized wealth management services is increasing, with the number of family offices expected to grow significantly by 2030. Potential candidates find it difficult to step into the family office bandwagon, and some family offices can also be particular when it comes to choosing the perfect fit. The talent crunch is also owed to a lack of qualified candidates ‚Äî it's also selectivity on the part of family offices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils challenges the belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting seasonal temperature changes and the presence of polar ice. Scientists found that the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced significant temperature variations, similar to today's. The findings offer insight into climate change, highlighting the transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with only seasonal ice, or shifting from a predominantly white winter planet to a blue one.</p>

          <h2>Iran Proposes Joint Nuclear Enrichment Venture With Arab Countries and U.S. Investment</h2>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives. However, the feasibility of such a venture, given tensions between Iran and its rivals, remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Egg Prices Fall Slightly but Remain Near Record Highs</h2>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced their first month-to-month decline since October 2024, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen in April after reaching a record $6.23 in March. The decline is attributed to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. Despite the drop, egg prices remain significantly higher than the previous year due to the ongoing impact of bird flu, which has killed millions of birds. President Trump has focused on lowering egg prices, with the USDA investing in biosecurity measures and increased egg imports.</p>
