          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. The contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with annualized GDP contracting by 0.7%. While domestic demand showed strength by growing 0.6%, exports were significantly impacted by uncertainties arising from U.S. trade policies, overshadowing the competitive advantage gained from a weak yen. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current rates, awaiting more certainty in the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its factories globally with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as part of a business restructuring. The announcement comes as Nissan plans to lay off 11,000 workers and close seven factories due to weak sales in key markets. The partnership with Dongfeng, which has been in place for over 20 years, currently involves building cars in Wuhan, China. The potential sharing of global plants reflects Nissan's efforts to cut costs and navigate a challenging automotive market, but specific details and implications for its UK plant in Sunderland remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene when a land bridge connected the two continents. The study of fossils, including Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, indicates mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The scientists found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions.</p>

          <p>Walmart warned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. The retailer cited President Trump's levies on U.S. trade partners as impeding its ability to keep prices low for customers. The company expects the price hikes to go into effect later this month. Walmart's CEO emphasized that the retailer will do what it can to avoid passing the import taxes onto customers, but the tariff's cost pressures continue to be a factor.</p>

The UAE will also invest in, build, or finance US data centers that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE. The agreement also contains historic commitments by the UAE to further align their national security regulations with the United States.</p>

          <p>A military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million.
