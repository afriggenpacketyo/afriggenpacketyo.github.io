          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage and reconnect with real-world experiences, as evidenced by the popularity of offline meetups and digital detox retreats. Studies indicate that many young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire a "digital curfew" to limit access to certain apps and websites. Governments are considering measures such as mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media use to address the harmful effects of excessive smartphone use on mental health. The article notes that while digital media use increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, research has not yet proven a direct causal link between digital media use and mental health deterioration. </p>

The Dodgers initially considered having him pitch earlier in the season but decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehabilitation.
