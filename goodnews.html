          <p>Liberal and pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. The election followed months of political instability, including the annulment of a previous presidential race due to alleged Russian interference. Dan secured 54% of the vote, emphasizing unity and change for Romania. Simion, despite a strong showing in the diaspora, conceded victory. Supporters of Dan expressed relief and optimism for a pro-European future. Relevant context: This election occurred amidst broader discontent with mainstream parties and government instability in Romania, an EU and NATO member state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Budget Committee has advanced President Trump's domestic policy bill, overcoming initial opposition from conservative Republicans concerned about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, allowing the bill to move forward with four conservative holdouts voting present. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill now heads to the Rules Committee, but faces potential challenges from both conservatives seeking deeper cuts and moderates concerned about state and local tax deductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" passed a key hurdle in the House after conservative Republicans initially blocked its advancement. The bill, aimed at enacting Trump's policies on tax cuts, immigration, energy, defense, and raising the debt limit, now moves to the House Rules Committee for further consideration. Conservatives had opposed aspects of the legislation's crackdown on Medicaid and green energy subsidies, while moderates pushed for larger state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps. The bill still faces potential changes in the Senate, requiring further negotiations between the House and Senate.</p>

          <p>While former President Joseph R. Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis is serious, advances in treatment and diagnosis have significantly improved survival rates for men with advanced disease. Prostate cancer specialists emphasize that life expectancy is now measured in years, not months, due to research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department. The first line of attack involves cutting off testosterone, and new scans allow doctors to spot the cancer much earlier. Federal research money, including Biden's cancer moonshot effort, has contributed to this progress, with survival rates almost tripling in the last decade.</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine, resembling any other New England church from the outside, holds a secret: its interior is covered with 70-year-old frescoes, leading some to call it "the Sistine Chapel of Maine". Painted by artists in the 1950s, the murals have gained renewed interest due to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, now serves as a space for community gatherings and artistic events, with many of its original features still intact. The frescoes depict various biblical scenes, offering inspiration to art lovers decades later.</p>

          <p>China‚Äôs economy has demonstrated resilience in April, despite the effects of high US tariffs implemented before a recent agreement to remove or pause most duties. Industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding estimates, while retail sales rose by 5.1%, falling short of expectations. The government has vowed to focus on stabilizing employment, businesses, markets, and expectations, affirming the need to bolster domestic consumption. The agreement providing a 90-day reprieve in the trade conflict has eased some pressures, but the future of global trade remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached to end New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, just three days after it began. The strike, involving passenger-train drivers, was called off at about 6 p.m. on Sunday, with NJ Transit announcing that trains would resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning. The main sticking point had been the engineers' demand for pay on par with their counterparts at other passenger railroads. A tentative agreement was reached that is "fair to NJ Transit's employees while also being affordable for our state's commuters and taxpayers."</p>

The agency will use Monday to perform safety checks, and commuters are encouraged to work from home to ease the transition.</p>
