          <h2>Flexible Work Options Seen as Key to Teacher Retention</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, returned to work part-time after having a baby and believes that offering flexible working options for teachers is key to addressing recruitment and retention issues. Government data suggests that while the overall number of teachers has fallen slightly, there are more teachers in secondary and special schools compared to last year. Computer science teacher Sam Alner notes the relentless nature of teaching and the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance, especially in disadvantaged areas where recruitment is difficult. The government aims to recruit 6,500 new teachers, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson advocating for more schools to offer flexible hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how tellurium nanowire implants were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a rare element produced as a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy. Scientists are exploring the use of tellurium as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The confusion likely arose due to the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant cards. The REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 to establish standards for identification sources following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China is facing a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the decline in fertility rates especially urgent. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's grueling "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Some venture capitalists have been pushing for a culture of overwork to compete on a global stage, but founders argue that it's a myth and leads to decreased retention and a revolving door of talent. They insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to position themselves as key players in the global startup scene. The younger generation is less likely to put up with overworking and tends to prioritize work-life balance.</p>
