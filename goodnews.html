        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise relaxation and health benefits is facing scrutiny from health experts. While consumers enjoy these drinks as alcohol alternatives, dietitians and nutritionists are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine they contain are sufficient to produce the advertised effects. An ad by a leading brand, Trip, was recently banned for making unproven health claims, highlighting the debate over their efficacy. Psychologists suggest the calming effect may be more of a placebo, derived from the ritual of taking a moment for a personal treat.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last newspaper hawker in France, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of the nation's highest honors, from President Emmanuel Macron. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has sold newspapers on the streets of Paris's Left Bank, a familiar figure who has witnessed the decline of print media firsthand. Despite the drop in sales from 80 copies an hour in his prime to around 30 per day now, he continues for the joy and freedom the job provides. He fondly recalls the neighborhood's vibrant past and its famous figures, including a young Macron.</p>

          <p>The Frederick County Board of Education is updating its policies to comply with a new Maryland state law requiring schools to facilitate student telehealth appointments during the school day by the 2025-26 school year. The proposed regulation would allow students to attend virtual medical or mental health appointments in a designated, supervised space on campus. The school system's role is limited to providing the location and access, not the healthcare itself, with parents required to schedule the appointments and be present. This initiative aims to provide equitable access to healthcare while minimizing disruption to students' education.</p>

The event, which has run for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of all dogs, regardless of pedigree, and awarded Petunia's owner $5,000. Many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills, highlighting the positive aspects of animal adoption.

          <p>A man in Leicestershire received a £165 parking penalty after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. Richard Lynn paid to park his Hyundai for 30 minutes, but the system's photographic evidence showed his car entering and a different car, a Kia with a nearly identical license plate, leaving nine hours later. The private firm, Horizon Parking, initially sent demands to an old address, which escalated before he was notified. The company claims it has since rectified the error, but Mr. Lynn expressed frustration over the automated, aggressive process and the lack of human oversight.</p>

          <p>Musician Ed Sheeran recently sparked a debate after describing himself as "culturally Irish," despite being born and raised in England. The statement drew some criticism online but also highlighted the complex and evolving nature of cultural identity, especially for those in the Irish diaspora with strong family ties to the country. Experts note that in the post-Good Friday Agreement era, identity is less binary, allowing for blended "or both" affiliations. The discussion encompasses the broad spectrum of what "Irishness" means today, from the experiences of second-generation immigrants to the shared cultural touchstones that cross political and geographical borders.</p>

          <p>The release of a new "War of the Worlds" adaptation, which received a 0% initial score on Rotten Tomatoes, has sparked conversations about why audiences are often drawn to critically panned films. Some viewers and critics argue that movies that are "so bad they're good" can be more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. Experts suggest there's a charm in watching earnestly made films that fail spectacularly, offering a unique and often humorous viewing experience. This phenomenon has created cult followings for movies like "The Room" and "Samurai Cop," which are celebrated for their unintentional comedy and visible production flaws.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months after the Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 shocked Silicon Valley with its impressive capabilities and low development cost, its long-term impact is being assessed. The app's release briefly wiped billions from Nvidia's market value and challenged the "bigger is better" philosophy dominating American AI development. While no longer a headline-grabber, DeepSeek demonstrated that smaller, more efficient models could be highly competitive, influencing OpenAI's recent release of smaller, open models. However, concerns about data security and the company's ties to Beijing persist, and the American tech industry has largely returned to a focus on massive-scale AI investment.

President Trump stated that Apple's commitment to US manufacturing would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about profitability. This successful meeting compounded positive momentum from Apple's recent earnings report, which showed strong revenue and iPhone sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol made history on Saturday by becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game. Her debut was at first base for a game between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, watched by dozens of her friends and family. Pawol, 48, has been working in the minor leagues since 2016 and said she was "overcome with emotion" upon receiving the promotion. Following the game, she donated the cap she wore during her historic debut to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, marking a significant milestone for women in the sport.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig with a win, defeating Olga Danilovic 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. After a slow start, Raducanu demonstrated strong defense and returning, capitalizing on her opponent's errors to secure a comfortable victory in the sweltering heat. This win continues her recent solid form against lower-ranked players and sets up a challenging third-round match against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu appears more match-tough and confident as she continues her North American hard-court season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, suggesting people over 50 should eat more of the fruit to support healthy brain aging. Pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fruit can be costly and seasonal, pomegranate extract is an alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugar. Individuals on certain medications should consult a doctor before adding pomegranates to their diet.</p>

          <p>Despite a spectacular unbeaten 86 runs from just 50 balls by Jonny Bairstow, his Welsh Fire team fell short, losing to London Spirit by eight runs in The Hundred. Chasing 164, Fire suffered a top-order collapse, leaving Bairstow with a monumental task. He launched a stunning late assault, including back-to-back sixes, to bring his team close but ultimately could not overcome the deficit. Spirit's total of 163-5 was anchored by an unbeaten 70 from Australian opener David Warner, securing their first win of the competition and leaving both of Welsh Fire's teams winless.</p>
