          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are leading a U.S. delegation to the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, signaling the Trump administration's focus on the Indo-Pacific region. The summit, which convenes over 550 delegates from 40 nations, is considered Asia's top defense summit. Gabbard is expected to discuss major security challenges with regional leaders, building on her recent trip to India and meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This diplomatic tour highlights the administration's broader efforts to elevate U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, shifting Gabbard's role from military service to high-stakes diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has partially reversed its decision to revoke Harvard University's certification to enroll international students, granting the school 30 days to challenge the decision. This action followed Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's allegations of Harvard fostering an unsafe environment hostile to Jewish students and promoting pro-Hamas sympathies. A U.S. District Judge, Allison Burroughs, intends to issue a preliminary injunction to protect Harvard's international students, despite the administration's backtracking. Harvard is also contesting the Trump administration's attempt to freeze over $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the school, asserting that these actions are retaliatory for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Boeing will resume airplane deliveries to China next month after a pause due to trade tensions, according to CEO Kelly Ortberg. Ortberg stated that China has indicated it will take deliveries, with the first shipments scheduled for June. Despite tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, Boeing is managing to recoup much of the cost when the planes are exported. The company's ability to navigate trade issues is crucial as it ramps up production of its 737 Max aircraft.</p>

          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC rates will likely remain stable in June, despite a recent decline in inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain the federal funds rate, leading to consistent prime rates. While home equity loans offer fixed rates, HELOC rates adjust monthly based on the prime rate. Some experts suggest rates could increase due to tariffs and their inflationary effects, but for now, borrowers can expect rates to stay roughly the same (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Astronomers searching for the elusive "Planet Nine" have instead discovered a new dwarf planet in the outer reaches of the solar system, named 2017 OF201. The object, roughly 430 miles across, is three times smaller than Pluto and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years to complete. This discovery could challenge the Planet Nine theory, as the new dwarf planet's orbit does not follow the clustered trend of similar objects.

          <p>A recent court ruling blocking President Trump's tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs the court ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are significant UK exports to the US. While the UK has a deal to reduce tariffs on these items, it is not yet in force. The ruling does block a 10% blanket tariff on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for British exporters.</p>

The company now projects adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33, and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year.

The court found that the Surface Transportation Board, which approved the project, had consulted with agencies, considered effects, and ordered mitigation measures, and Justice Gorsuch recused himself.</p>
