          <p>European leaders are capitalizing on the Trump administration's cuts to research funding and threats to universities by offering financial incentives to U.S.-based researchers. French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced investments and programs aimed at attracting scientific talent to Europe. This initiative comes as the U.S. government reduces research programs, attacks diversity initiatives, and removes terms like "climate science" from websites, creating a sense of strategic opportunity for Europe to become a haven for free and open scientific inquiry.

          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, despite never having held a top government position. The Bundestag will decide on May 6, following the formal signing of a coalition agreement between the CDU and Social Democrats (SPD). Merz, a commercial lawyer and transatlanticist, has been fleshing out his plans for government, including continued military aid to Ukraine and a focus on internal security. His election would mark the high point of an unusual political career.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala raised a record $31 million this year, solidifying its status as a pre-eminent benefit among cultural institutions. The event, which marks the opening of the Costume Institute exhibition "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," is known for its glamorous guest list and high ticket prices. While the gala is a significant fund-raiser for the Costume Institute, it also carries a substantial cost, including millions spent on entertainment and staff. The event's success is attributed to Anna Wintour's leadership and its ability to attract celebrities and corporate sponsors.</p>
