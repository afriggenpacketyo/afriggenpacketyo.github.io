          <p>Asian markets experienced a significant surge, with stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong leading the gains after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a potential easing of monetary policy. This dovish stance has fueled investor optimism about capital rotating from the U.S. to Chinese equities, contributing to the CSI 300 index reaching a 37-month high. The rally was widespread, encompassing sectors from technology to property, with the Hang Seng Tech index climbing over three percent, reflecting a broad-based confidence in the region's economic performance.

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate for July cooled to 0.6%, its lowest level since January 2021 and below economists' expectations. The moderation was driven by a fall in prices for retail goods, electricity, and gas, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects inflation to remain moderate due to easing global oil prices and slower domestic wage growth, which could provide justification for loosening monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting to support the city-state's weakening economic growth.
