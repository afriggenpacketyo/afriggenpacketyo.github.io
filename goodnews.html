          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 11:04:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phantom energy, also known as vampire energy, refers to electricity silently consumed by devices left plugged in but not actively in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of household energy. This wasted power contributes to climate change by increasing demand for emissions-producing electricity sources. Experts recommend simple actions like unplugging chargers and unused appliances, or disabling smart features on devices like internet-connected TVs, to reduce this drain. Such individual efforts, when multiplied across the country, can significantly decrease U.S. carbon emissions and save money on utility bills.</p>

          <p>Actress Demi Moore has publicly defended Emma Heming Willis, wife of her ex-husband Bruce Willis, against criticism regarding her caregiving decisions for the actor, who is battling frontotemporal dementia. Moore emphasized the lack of a roadmap for such a diagnosis and praised Emma's dedication to self-care, recognizing its importance for caregivers. Emma Heming Willis recently faced backlash for moving Bruce into a separate home with professional caregivers, which she addressed by highlighting the judgment caregivers often face. Moore also shared her personal struggle of seeing Bruce's decline and the importance of meeting individuals with dementia where they are, without expectations.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee program, which allowed members to share free shipping benefits with non-household individuals, effective October 1. Instead, the company is encouraging these users to purchase their own Prime subscriptions, offering a one-year discounted rate of $14.99. The Invitee program is being replaced by "Amazon Family," which permits sharing a broader range of Prime benefits, including Prime Video and Music, but only with one other adult within the same household, alongside up to four teens and children profiles. This move aims to nudge non-household users into full Prime memberships following a 2022 price increase.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims of Higher Crime Rates in Democrat-Led Cities</h2>

          <p>A fact-check analysis debunks President Trump's repeated claims that Democrat-governed cities inherently experience higher crime rates, asserting that such a link is not supported by data. While most large U.S. cities are led by Democrats and tend to report higher crime rates than rural areas, correlation does not imply causation. Research from Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, spanning three decades and 400 cities, found no detectable impact of a mayor's political affiliation on crime rates or policing. The article emphasizes that crime rates are influenced by complex socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, not a mayor's party, and that national violent crime has largely decreased over the past 30 years despite public perception.</p>

          <h2>HELOCs vs. Home Equity Loans: Assessing Affordability in September 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 10:47:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners seeking low-cost financing are weighing HELOCs against home equity loans, both currently offering average rates just over 8%, significantly lower than credit cards or personal loans. The affordability choice depends on rates, repayment terms, fees, and credit profile, with a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September possibly influencing variable HELOC rates. HELOCs offer flexible access to credit with interest-only payments during a draw period, but variable rates mean payments can change. Home equity loans provide predictable, fixed payments over a set term, offering stability despite potentially slightly higher initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that critical DNA evidence, obtained using advanced whole genome sequencing technology, will be admissible in the Gilgo Beach serial killer case. This marks the first time this new DNA technology has been accepted in a New York court, overcoming defense challenges. Prosecutors successfully argued that the technique is scientifically accepted and links alleged killer Rex Heuermann, or individuals residing with him, to hairs found on six of the seven victims. Heuermann, arrested in July 2023, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of seven women whose remains were discovered on Long Island.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano experienced its 32nd eruption episode this week, shooting lava 500 feet into the air from its summit crater before ceasing activity after 13 hours. The eruption, which began in December, released approximately 337 million cubic feet of molten rock, covering a significant portion of the Halemaumau Crater floor within Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park. Although no injuries were reported, high levels of volcanic gas, including 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, are expected to linger, creating volcanic smog that can cause respiratory issues. Officials also warned of other hazards like volcanic glass strands and fragments in surrounding areas.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Gdansk, "Our Boys," is stirring controversy in Poland by addressing the long-taboo subject of Polish citizens who served in the Nazi German Wehrmacht during World War II. The exhibition aims to present the nuanced, tragic choices faced by Poles forcibly conscripted into the enemy army after large parts of Poland were annexed by Nazi Germany. Right-wing conservatives, including former President Andrzej Duda, have criticized the exhibition as a "historical falsehood" and "moral provocation," asserting Poles were victims, not participants.

          <p>Alphabet shares jumped 9% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the most severe breakup proposals in Google's antitrust case, a decision viewed favorably by investors. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the judge rejected the Justice Department's request to divest its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Google will also retain the ability to pay companies, like Apple, to preload its products, provided these are not exclusive contracts. This outcome is seen as a significant win for Google, reducing a major overhang on its stock and bolstering confidence in the long-term durability of its search business, especially as it invests heavily in AI with Gemini.

Kennedy Jr. The governors assert that the CDC has become a "political tool" that jeopardizes public health.
