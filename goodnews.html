          <p>China is intensifying efforts to stimulate domestic consumption through structural financial support and incentives, as the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) allocates 500 billion yuan for consumption and pension loans. The PBOC aims to encourage financial institutions to provide loans to businesses in key sectors such as retail, hotels, restaurants, sports, entertainment, and tourism. This initiative includes 19 measures to support both consumers and sellers, reflecting the government's commitment to bolstering consumption amid trade uncertainties and unemployment pressures. China hopes to strengthen consumption's role in economic development through these measures. This is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the Chinese economy by encouraging domestic spending.

          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong initial showing, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to concede. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters, while Cuomo, who resigned the governorship amid sexual harassment allegations, aimed for a political comeback. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, as no candidate reached the 50% threshold. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the heavily Democratic city's general election, although incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent. The results reflect a shift in voter preferences and could signal a change in the city's political landscape.</p>

Lattouf's dismissal triggered public outrage and raised questions over the broadcaster's independence and support for culturally diverse staff.

          <p>A proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states, including California, was removed from the Republican tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. Senator Mike Lee's plan aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule. Lee is attempting to revise the proposal, but environmentalists and public land advocates remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral primary is seen as a test for the Democratic Party. Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing outsider, is challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo is hoping for a comeback after resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal. The race is being watched as a proxy war between the left and moderates within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Two young bears escaped from their enclosure at a U.K. wildlife park and devoured a week's worth of food store honey before falling asleep, the park said on Tuesday. Mish and Lucy, both aged four, got out of their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in southwestern England on Monday afternoon. The bears "posed no threat to the public at any point" although visitors on site were escorted to a secure building as a precaution.</p>
