          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2 billion upgrade, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened. The 28-mile improvement project, initiated in 2002, aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to offset its environmental impact. While some residents and officials laud the improved travel times and safety, others criticize the project's cost and delays, with the Welsh government planning to pay over ¬£40m a year for 30 years to finance the final stretch of road.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the world's population may be significantly higher than the United Nations' estimate of 8.2 billion, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions. The study found that UN estimates undercount the number of people living in rural areas by more than 50% due to incomplete census data in the global south. While some express concerns about overpopulation and its impact on resources, the article argues that anxieties about population growth often reflect power struggles over resource allocation and whose lives are valued. The article concludes that compromise and sharing are essential for managing the Earth's resources and ensuring a sustainable future.</p>

With the number of dementia cases expected to rise, memory cafes are becoming an increasingly important and affordable part of the continuum of care, particularly as they do not heavily rely on federal funding.</p>

Ito-Yokado Co. and Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first retailers to offer the rice, setting a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5-kilogram bag. The move aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households, with the government releasing 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 through direct contracts with retailers. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this measure will effectively curb rice prices.</p>
