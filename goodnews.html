          <p>Week two of the NFL season delivered a series of exciting matchups, highlighted by the Dallas Cowboys' thrilling 40-37 overtime victory against the New York Giants, extending their division winning streak to nine games. The Cincinnati Bengals also secured a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but their triumph was overshadowed by a concerning toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow, whose return remains uncertain. Other significant games included the Detroit Lions' dominant 52-21 win over the Chicago Bears and the Buffalo Bills' comfortable 30-10 defeat of the New York Jets. These results showcased both high-stakes competition and early season challenges across the league.</p>

          <h2>Limestone Application in Farmland Offers Breakthrough for Carbon Storage and Emission Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 17:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking Yale-led study, published in Nature Water, reveals that the widespread application of crushed limestone on agricultural land could significantly reduce carbon emissions by enhancing natural carbon storage processes. This inexpensive and soil-beneficial method facilitates the reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate ions, which are then washed into waterways and converted into stable calcium carbonate, sequestering carbon for millions of years. Given that agriculture contributes approximately 10% of global annual carbon emissions, researchers advocate for this approach as a crucial and accessible priority for carbon removal, complementing broader efforts to combat climate change.</p>

          <p>"Buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans are rapidly gaining traction, with an estimated 86.5 million Americans utilizing these interest-free installment plans as a popular alternative to traditional credit cards. However, established banks and credit card companies view this surge with considerable apprehension, as BNPL services directly reduce their transaction activity and credit utilization, which are major drivers of their revenue. Financial institutions also express significant concern that the widespread adoption of BNPL creates a "giant black hole" in their ability to accurately assess consumers' credit quality and risk profiles.

          <p>Barron Trump, son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to attend NYU's D.C. program, opting to remain geographically close to his parents rather than enrolling at the main Manhattan campus. This decision to join a program that integrates coursework with government-focused internships has ignited speculation about his potential future involvement in politics, especially given his past contributions to his father's campaign. While his previous major was business, his move to the D.C. program suggests a possible pivot towards studies more aligned with public policy or journalism.</p>
