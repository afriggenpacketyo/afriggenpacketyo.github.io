          <p>Two-time WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan, real name Terry Gene Bollea, has died at 71 due to cardiac arrest. Hogan was instrumental in transforming professional wrestling into a mainstream phenomenon in the 1980s, known for his "Hulkamania" persona and catchphrases. Beyond the ring, he became a cultural icon, appearing in films and TV, and later evolved into the "Hollywood Hogan" villain. Despite controversies, including a sex tape lawsuit and racist remarks, he remained a significant figure, recently endorsing Donald Trump at the RNC.</p>

          <p>A Brookings Institution report reveals a significant surge in job postings requiring artificial intelligence skills, increasing over 100% in the last year alone. This growth, averaging nearly 29% annually over 15 years, outpaces general economy job postings, driven by more companies integrating AI into their operations. While concentrated in tech hubs like San Francisco, AI-related roles are diffusing into non-tech fields such as marketing and finance, with over half of 2024 postings outside IT. These positions also command higher salaries, averaging 28% more than similar roles without AI requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing Returns: 6-Month CD vs. High-Yield Savings for $25,000</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of a $25,000 investment in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. A CD, offering a fixed rate, currently yields slightly more interest and provides protection against future rate cuts, which are anticipated in late 2025. Conversely, a high-yield savings account offers greater liquidity but with variable rates that could decrease. The decision ultimately hinges on an individual's financial situation, emergency fund needs, short-term commitments, and risk tolerance, as accessibility often outweighs minor interest differentials.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its decision to phase out paper checks for beneficiaries, opting to continue offering them, particularly for those without electronic payment access. This about-face follows criticism, notably from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who highlighted that many "unbanked" Americans, especially seniors, rely on paper checks. While the SSA will still promote electronic transfers for their efficiency and security benefits, this policy shift ensures no beneficiaries are left behind. The article also notes improving customer service metrics at the SSA, including reduced phone wait times.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he would send a new anti-corruption bill to Parliament, reversing a previous attempt that sparked widespread protests and condemnation from the European Union. The initial bill was criticized for granting the government more power over anti-corruption watchdogs, raising concerns about a return to past political practices. Zelenskyy's decision to revise the legislation, which he stated will strengthen the rule of law and protect against foreign interference, reflects a responsiveness to both domestic public opinion and international partners, who view anti-corruption reforms as crucial for Ukraine's EU integration and Western aid.</p>
