          <p>President Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to lead the new US National Design Studio, an agency tasked with revamping government websites and online services. The studio aims to improve the usability, aesthetics, and user experience of public-facing digital platforms, with Gebbia stating his goal is to make them "beautiful" and modern. This new body is seen as a successor to the Department of Government Efficiency, previously headed by Elon Musk. Gebbia, who has shifted his political alignment from Democrat to supporting Trump, will lead the three-year initiative.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce delays and cut the costs associated with housing migrants in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the creation of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to handle appeals more swiftly, as the current process averages over a year. The move comes amid pressure to end the use of asylum hotels, which currently house 32,000 people. Advocacy groups like the Refugee Council argue that the focus should be on improving the quality of initial decisions to reduce the number of appeals.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban environments across the United States, with a notable pair named Romeo and Juliet making their home in New York's Central Park. Originally native to the western U.S., coyotes have expanded eastward due to a decline in predators and changing landscapes. Local photographers and conservationists are documenting the Central Park coyotes to educate the public and promote coexistence, emphasizing that the animals are not a threat if left alone. Officials have shifted their approach from capture to management, aiming to ensure both people and wildlife can safely share urban green spaces.</p>

          <p>A new cultural meme, the "performative male," has gained traction among Gen Z on TikTok, describing men who adopt an alternative, intellectual, and progressive aesthetic, seemingly to attract women. This archetype is characterized by interests like feminist literature, matcha, and indie music, with public contests being held to find the best impersonators. While often lighthearted, the trend also reflects a deeper suspicion that such traits might be a deceptive performance rather than genuine. This phenomenon taps into broader internet discussions about authenticity, gender presentation, and the complexities of modern dating dynamics.</p>

          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival in west London began on Sunday with its traditional children's parade, filling the streets with vibrant costumes, music, and dancing. The festivities officially started at dawn with J'ouvert, where revelers covered themselves in bright paint and powder to mark the opening of Europe's largest street party. The event, which has been celebrated for over 50 years, will also include a 72-second silence on both days. This moment of reflection is to honor the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away in recent years.</p>

          <p>Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator, argues that despite the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and withdrawal from federal climate initiatives, the fight against climate change continues at state and local levels. She points out that states like California, Florida, and Texas are setting records in clean energy adoption, driven by economic and environmental benefits. McCarthy emphasizes that states, cities, businesses, and international partners are bypassing the federal government to advance clean energy, create jobs, and build resilience. She asserts that this grassroots momentum demonstrates a refusal to let the administration dictate the country's environmental future.</p>

          <p>Former USC and Raiders quarterback Todd Marinovich reflects on writing his new memoir, describing the process as a cathartic act of self-love after a life defined by defiance and public scrutiny. In an interview, Marinovich discusses his complex relationship with his overbearing father, the pressures of being a prodigy, and his harrowing descent into drug addiction. He clarifies long-standing myths, such as never having eaten a Big Mac, and shares stories from his wild college days and troubled NFL career. Marinovich, now 47, hopes sharing his experiences with addiction and recovery can provide insight for others.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Open brings tennis into the spotlight, the sport is being highlighted for its significant long-term health benefits, making it an excellent lifetime activity. Tennis provides a full-body aerobic workout that improves muscle strength, bone density, and cardiovascular health, with one study linking it to a nearly decade-longer lifespan compared to sedentary peers. Beyond physical advantages, the sport demands complex motor coordination, strategic thinking, and quick reaction times, which can enhance cognitive function and potentially buffer against age-related decline. Its accessibility on public courts and low risk of serious injury contribute to its growing popularity.</p>

          <p>Rather than focusing on fully automating jobs, developers should design AI to collaborate with and enhance human expertise, especially in fields where full automation is not yet feasible or reliable. Using radiology and aviation as examples, the article argues that imperfect automation tools can undermine human skill and lead to critical errors when human oversight is required as a fail-safe. A collaborative model, like a pilot's heads-up display, leverages AI's data-processing power while keeping the human expert engaged, leading to better outcomes. This approach is crucial for preventing skill decay and ensuring AI serves as a powerful partner.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The First and Last Bank," proposes a novel approach to climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon as a valuable, sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government sequesters gold. The concept involves local, cooperative "carbon banks" that would accept organic waste, convert it into a stable carbon form like biochar, and issue a digital currency to depositors in return. This grassroots system aims to create a new economy around carbon sequestration, independent of government action. The authors argue that this could incentivize the removal of carbon from the atmosphere on a large scale.</p>

          <p>The "Pure Michigan" tourism campaign has launched a unique marketing initiative by creating a line of room and body sprays designed to evoke the scents of a Michigan summer. Developed with a local fragrance lab, the scent aims to capture the essence of freshwater coastlines, wineries, and lavender fields to promote the state as a destination for mindful travel. The campaign is also using scratch-and-sniff panels in travel magazines to share the experience. This creative approach is part of a larger effort to stand out in the competitive landscape of state tourism marketing.</p>

          <p>At a White House event themed "Make American Health Tech Great Again," the Trump administration and leaders from over 60 major healthcare and tech companies committed to building a modern, patient-centric digital health ecosystem. The initiative focuses on creating an interoperable framework to break down data silos, allowing health information to flow securely between patients and providers. The goal is to empower patients with control over their own data and foster innovation in personalized digital tools, such as health management apps and AI assistants, to improve outcomes and reduce administrative burdens.
