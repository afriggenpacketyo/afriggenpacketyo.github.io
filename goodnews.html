        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Julia Roberts has responded to backlash against her new film, "After the Hunt," which some critics at the Venice Film Festival claim revives outdated arguments about believing women's allegations of sexual assault. Roberts argued that the film is intended to spark conversation and challenge audiences, not to make definitive statements. She emphasized the importance of dialogue in a society that she feels is "losing the art of conversation." The psychological drama, directed by Luca Guadagnino, centers on a professor whose life is upended when a student accuses a colleague, forcing her to confront a secret from her own past.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has announced she will run for Congress, contingent on California voters approving a redrawn district map in a November special election. The 67-year-old former Secretary of Labor is targeting the newly configured 38th District, which would be left without an incumbent. Solis has already secured endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and several sitting members of Congress, signaling strong establishment support for her campaign. The proposed redistricting is part of a broader Democratic strategy to gain more House seats in California.</p>

          <p>Al DiStefano, a 77-year-old Texas resident, has been reunited with his college class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, an electrician using a metal detector at Cedar Beach, New York. Despite the ring's potential scrap value, Orlowski was determined to find its owner. Using the engravings, he tracked down a Fordham University alumni group, which connected him with DiStefano, who called the ring's return a "miracle."</p>

          <p>Shares of "buy now, pay later" company Affirm jumped 12% following a strong fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company reported earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year. CEO Max Levchin highlighted continued consumer strength and transaction frequency, noting that the company is "firing on all pistons." The positive results and upbeat guidance for the next fiscal year helped allay concerns about increased competition and the recent loss of Walmart as a partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a slight downturn on Friday that broke a four-week winning streak, the S&P 500 concluded August with a gain of approximately 2%, marking its fourth consecutive month of advances. Friday's dip was partly attributed to profit-taking before the holiday weekend and a modest decline in Nvidia's stock, even after its strong earnings report earlier in the week. The market also processed the latest PCE inflation data, which showed core inflation at its highest annual rate since February. Still, investors largely expect the Federal Reserve to proceed with an interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found. The remains, discovered in Morocco, show that the 165-million-year-old herbivore had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate species. Initially understood from just a single bone, the new findings provide a clearer picture of this "punk rocker" dinosaur, which also had a tail weapon and a bony collar. This discovery may force scientists to reassess theories about the evolution of ankylosaur armor.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won re-election decisively in the town's first formal election since at least the 1960s. Four years ago, after becoming mayor-elect by running unopposed, Braxton said he was locked out of the town hall by the previous all-White leadership. This led to a lawsuit and a federal settlement that mandated the recent election. For decades, Newbern's leadership was passed down by appointment, resulting in a White government in a majority-Black town. Braxton's victory with 66 votes to his opponent's 26 solidifies his leadership and marks a significant shift in the town's governance.</p>

This new show fully embraces the elaborate costumes, video screens, and classic song parodies that made him famous. Yankovic, 65, explains he took a break from parodies partly because he wanted to prove he was "more than just the parody guy" and because pop culture has become more fragmented. Now, with an expanded band, he is revisiting hits like "Eat It" and "Amish Paradise" for large arena audiences.</p>

For the first time, graduating seniors in high school and college have had AI tools available for their entire four-year careers, leading to its normalization for everything from writing essays to completing assignments. While students have widely adopted AI for productivity, many educators have a "blind spot" regarding the extent of its use. This has created a "pedagogical debt," forcing a re-evaluation of teaching methods, assignments, and the core goals of education in an AI-driven world.</p>

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates still relatively high, seniors have several alternative ways to tap into their home equity without altering their existing home loans. One key option, available only to homeowners aged 62 and older, is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments without requiring monthly repayments. Other viable choices include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line with variable rates. These methods allow senior homeowners to leverage their assets while preserving their current, likely lower, mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>
