          <p>A four-year mystery surrounding an unexpected guest at Michelle and John Wylie's Scottish wedding has finally been resolved, thanks to an internet sleuth. The couple discovered a complete stranger in their wedding photos and, despite quizzing family, friends, and venue staff, could not identify him. The mystery man, Andrew Hillhouse, was revealed to have accidentally arrived at the wrong venue after being given incorrect directions to a different wedding two miles away. He only realized his mistake when the bride walked down the aisle, leading to a humorous account of him trying to blend in and later escape the unexpected ceremony. This article details the amusing resolution of a long-standing local enigma.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney shared insights into his Manchester derby experiences on his BBC podcast, including the "horrible" 6-1 defeat to Manchester City in 2011, a game he felt was a significant statement from City. He humorously recalled the awkwardness of attending his pre-planned birthday party with rival City players like Joe Hart and Gareth Barry that same night, admitting he "should have cancelled" despite family commitments. The article also touches on his iconic overhead kick goal from a game he felt he played "so bad," and discusses the unique pressures faced by children of professional footballers, including his son Kai and Shaun Wright-Phillips' daughter.</p>

          <p>Steve Reed, the newly appointed Housing Secretary, has strongly affirmed the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, declaring it "what we're going to do." He outlined a "build baby build" strategy, threatening sanctions on developers who delay projects, though specific penalties remain undefined. Industry leaders, however, warn of a "huge challenge" to meet this target, citing mounting pressures from rising regulatory costs, taxes, and planning application delays. Opposition parties have expressed deep skepticism, suggesting the government's housing pledges "are for the birds" and accusing them of being anti-business.</p>

          <p>California's Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and permit high-density housing near public transit stops. The legislation, which allows for buildings up to nine stories tall adjacent to certain transit corridors, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage. While supporters laud it as a necessary measure given the affordability crisis, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, argue it's an overreach that strips local control and could fundamentally alter single-family communities. The article notes the bill's increased momentum following amendments securing union hiring for certain projects.</p>
