        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to increasing airspace violations by Russian drones, several European countries, particularly Baltic and Eastern European states, are proposing the creation of a 'drone wall.' This concept is not a physical barrier but a coordinated, cross-border counter-drone system designed to detect, track, and intercept unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles. The initiative aims to pool resources and bolster Europe's collective defense, acting as both a deterrent and a defensive shield. However, the proposal faces significant financial, technical, and geopolitical hurdles, including concerns it could heighten tensions with Russia.</p>

The Thacker Pass mine is expected to become one of North America's largest lithium sources. Following the announcement, the company's stock surged over 35% in extended trading.

          <p>China has introduced a new 'K-visa' program designed to attract foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields without requiring prior employer sponsorship. The policy has triggered a significant online backlash from Chinese citizens, who fear it will create unfair competition for local graduates in an already strained job market. In response, state media outlets have dismissed the criticism as 'narrow-minded,' arguing that China needs high-level foreign talent to advance its technological ambitions and close the gap with the U.S.</p>

          <h2>The Etymology of 'Hoax': Tracing the Word's Origins to Magical Incantations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the word 'hoax,' revealing its origins in the magician's phrase 'hocus pocus.' The term likely derived from the stage name of a 17th-century magician, William Vincent, whose incantation became shorthand for trickery and deception. Over time, 'hocus' evolved into 'hoax,' first appearing around 1800 to describe a grander form of deception or fraud, separate from a simple lie. The article connects this linguistic history to famous historical hoaxes, illustrating how the concept has evolved.</p>

This marks a substantial increase from 34% in the previous year, driven by growing comfort with services like Apple Pay and Google Pay across all age groups. Consequently, the use of physical contactless cards has slightly decreased, though debit cards remain the most popular payment method overall. Cash usage continued to decline, accounting for less than 10% of all payments.</p>
