        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has reportedly reached an agreement to acquire German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of ¬£116 million, including a guaranteed ¬£100 million plus ¬£16 million in potential add-ons. The bonus payments would only be triggered if Liverpool achieves significant success, potentially setting a new British record. Wirtz reportedly favored a move to Anfield, leading to negotiations that resulted in a fee lower than Leverkusen's initial valuation of approximately ¬£126 million. Manchester City and Bayern Munich had also shown interest in Wirtz but ultimately withdrew due to cost considerations. </p>

          <p>According to HSBC's co-CEO, Hong Kong can play a vital role in the ongoing and orderly opening of mainland China's capital markets, especially in promoting the internationalization of the yuan. David Liao stated that Hong Kong's position as a financial hub connecting East and West allows it to expand the yuan's offshore liquidity while maintaining robust safeguards and risk management. An HSBC survey revealed that 81% of mainland businesses plan to expand overseas, and both institutional and retail investors intend to diversify their portfolios by allocating assets abroad. Liao also noted that the yuan is currently the third most-used currency for global trade finance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Copenhagen is implementing a comprehensive "Cloudburst Management Plan" to mitigate increased rainfall due to climate change, including the construction of underground tunnels and "sponge parks" to manage excess water. The Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel, a nearly mile-long tunnel, will hold 10,000 cubic meters of water during extreme rain events. Enghaveparken, a redesigned park, can transform into a massive reservoir capable of holding 25,000 cubic meters of water, with an underground storage tank for irrigation. The city is also constructing a human-made island, Lynetteholm, to protect against storm surges. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully dismantling buildings for reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. This approach creates a circular economy by keeping waste out of landfills and reducing the carbon footprint of construction. Cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., are leading the way, but widespread adoption requires local infrastructure for processing and distributing salvaged materials. While deconstruction can be more expensive and time-consuming than traditional demolition, some local governments are incentivizing or requiring it to promote sustainability. </p>

The flags serve as a reminder of the community's makeup and history, highlighting the reasons they have gathered to protest the treatment of new immigrants and ICE's presence in Los Angeles. The flags are a statement that "you can‚Äôt erase me, and I matter," expressing pride in their identity and origins. </p>

          <p>An upcoming parade in Washington celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, promoted by President Trump, is criticized for prioritizing equipment over the service of military personnel. The author, a 25-year Army veteran, argues that true honor lies in acknowledging the unique role of those in uniform while appreciating the sacrifices of civilians. The author suggests a modest acknowledgment is appropriate, emphasizing that soldiers are not special but rather come from the same communities as everyone else. The author concludes by advocating for a brief moment of direct eye contact and genuine words of appreciation as the most meaningful way to honor military service. </p>
