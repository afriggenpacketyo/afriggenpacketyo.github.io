          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that the next Federal Reserve chair must be someone capable of examining the entire organization, noting the Fed's mission has expanded beyond traditional monetary policy. In an interview, Bessent emphasized the need for a leader who has market confidence, can analyze complex data, and is forward-thinking rather than reliant on historical data. This comes as Bessent is reportedly leading the search for a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The comments highlight a desire for strategic reform within the central bank to address its evolving role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued a formal apology after a shoe he designed in collaboration with Adidas Originals sparked accusations of cultural appropriation. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was inspired by traditional huarache sandals from Mexico but was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities that originated the design. The controversy drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, prompting Adidas to also apologize and engage in discussions about restitution. The brand has since removed promotional images of the footwear from its social media platforms.</p>

The children, aged 4, 6, and 8, were last seen on Friday evening with their babysitter.

Authorities have not yet released details regarding the circumstances of their disappearance or their subsequent recovery, but the outcome was positive.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 16:22:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has reinstated a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, overturning a Trump administration directive. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. The lawsuit was filed by environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, who argued the administration illegally bypassed public comment procedures. The decision is being celebrated as a significant victory for the protection of the monument's vulnerable ecosystems, which are vital to Indigenous Pacific Islanders and home to pristine coral reefs.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's 2-2 draw and subsequent penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield showcased the potential and challenges of their revamped squad under manager Arne Slot. New signings, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz and goal-scorers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong, demonstrated offensive brilliance. However, the team also revealed defensive vulnerabilities, twice surrendering the lead and appearing disorganized at the back. Slot acknowledged that the four new starters need time to adapt, suggesting that while the attack looks promising, defensive cohesion remains a work in progress for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>"Dawson's Creek" actor James van der Beek, 48, has revealed that the first warning sign of his stage 3 colorectal cancer was a subtle change in his bowel movements, a symptom he initially dismissed. The actor, who was diagnosed in 2024, emphasized that he otherwise felt healthy and had no glaring red flags, highlighting the importance of screening. Medical experts confirm that changes in bowel habits are a key indicator, along with symptoms like fatigue and blood in the stool. His experience underscores the recommendation for colorectal cancer screening to begin at age 45, as early detection is critical.</p>
