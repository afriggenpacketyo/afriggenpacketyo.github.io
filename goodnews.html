          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Reinhard Buetikofer, a retired and outspoken German Member of the European Parliament, in an effort to normalize diplomatic relations with the EU. This move is expected to pave the way for the first official meeting between the European Parliament and China's National People's Congress since 2018, scheduled for October in Brussels. The decision came after European officials insisted on the removal of sanctions against Buetikofer, who was sanctioned in 2021, as a precondition for resuming formal political dialogue. This development signals a potential thaw in EU-China relations, which have been strained for several years.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying a privately-funded, four-person international crew successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding a 20-day mission to the International Space Station. The flight, designated Ax-4, was organized by Axiom Space and led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who further extended her U.S. record for the most time in space. During their mission, the crew conducted numerous science experiments and technology demonstrations on behalf of 31 countries. These commercial missions are part of Axiom's strategy to gain experience for building its own commercial space station before the ISS is retired.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's trading operations capitalized on market volatility, with fixed income revenue rising 14%. Despite a 10% drop in overall revenue compared to the prior year, which was skewed by a large gain on Visa shares, the underlying results were robust. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the bank's resilience but reiterated warnings about persistent economic risks, including trade uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, while also raising guidance for net interest income.

          <h2>New Weekly Injectable Drug Shows Promise in Replacing Daily Pills for Parkinson's Disease</h2>

          <p>Researchers at the University of South Australia have developed a long-acting injectable gel that could replace the daily oral medication regimen for millions of people with Parkinson's disease. The new formulation combines levodopa and carbidopa, the standard medications for managing symptoms, into a single weekly shot that provides a controlled, sustained release of the drugs. This approach aims to improve patient convenience, especially for those with difficulty swallowing, and maintain more consistent drug levels to enhance effectiveness and reduce side effects. The innovation has been filed for an Australian patent, with researchers hoping to begin clinical trials soon.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that the U.S. has reached a "great deal" with Indonesia, a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. The post mentioned direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto but offered no details about the terms of the agreement. This follows a similar pattern to a recent announcement of a deal with Vietnam, which was later met with confusion from Vietnamese officials. Indonesia is a significant U.S. trade partner, with a bilateral trade volume exceeding $38 billion in 2024, and the White House has yet to provide further information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates, propelled by a 16% year-over-year increase in markets revenue and an 18% rise in banking revenue. The bank's stock rose on the news, having already outperformed the market in the first half of the year. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence that her turnaround plan is working, and the bank raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, the results also showed a 16% growth in the cost of credit, partly due to a "deterioration" in the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips, used for developing artificial intelligence, to customers in China. The decision, announced by CEO Jensen Huang in Beijing, reverses previous restrictions that were put in place over national security concerns. The move follows intensive lobbying by Nvidia and other tech leaders, who argued that the export controls hindered U.S. competitiveness in the critical Chinese market. Huang emphasized the importance of American companies being able to serve the dynamic Chinese market, where half of the world's AI researchers are located.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer and favorite for The Open, gave a surprisingly philosophical press conference, questioning the point of his professional success. He reflected that the joy of winning is fleeting and that achievements like becoming world No. 1 do not provide deep, lasting fulfillment. Scheffler stated that his family is his true priority and that he would quit golf if it ever negatively affected his home life. While expressing his love for the challenge of the game, he candidly admitted to wrestling with why winning is so important to him when it doesn't satisfy the "deepest desires of his heart."</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers to prepare now to take advantage of lower borrowing costs. Key steps include researching the mortgage process, improving one's credit score by paying down debt, and saving for a down payment. Experts caution that while lower rates are beneficial, they often lead to increased buyer competition and higher home prices. Therefore, the primary focus should be on finding the right property and ensuring financial readiness, rather than trying to perfectly time the market for the lowest possible interest rate.

          <p>An international team of scientists has detected the gravitational waves from the largest black hole merger ever observed, which formed a new black hole 225 times the mass of the sun. The event, named GW231123, involved two precursor black holes that were themselves unusually large and spinning near the maximum speed allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. This discovery challenges and "pushes the limits of" current scientific models for how black holes are formed and grow. The complexity of the signal is expected to provide new avenues of research for years as astronomers work to understand its implications.</p>
