          <p>The United Soccer League (USL) has received a strategic investment from BellTower Partners, led by former Carlyle Group CEO Kewsong Lee, who will now serve as the league's vice-chair. This significant financial boost is aimed at strengthening the USL as it prepares to launch a new men's first-division league by 2028, positioning itself to directly compete with Major League Soccer. The league also intends to implement promotion and relegation between its divisions, a unique structure for U.S. professional sports.

          <p>Morgan Stanley is poised to launch direct cryptocurrency trading for its retail clients through its E-Trade division by the first half of 2026, partnering with Zerohash for essential services like liquidity and custody. This move reflects the Wall Street giant's deepening commitment to crypto, influenced by a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump. Initially, the offering will include Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana trading. Jed Finn, head of wealth management, described this as merely the "tip of the iceberg," indicating broader plans to integrate traditional and digital assets for wealthy clients, including the development of a proprietary digital asset custody solution.

          <p>NASA aims to launch its Artemis II crewed Moon mission as early as February, sending four astronauts on a ten-day journey around the Moon to test systems for future lunar landings. This mission marks the first time humans will venture beyond low Earth orbit since 1972, with astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen pushing further into space than previous crews. The mission will involve extensive system checks, a "space ballet" rehearsal for docking, and experiments to monitor the effects of space on the human body. While the launch window is set, experts consider the subsequent Artemis III lunar landing target of mid-2027 to be optimistic.</p>

          <p>Emil, a young male moose who garnered a significant social media following for his extensive wanderings across central Europe, has been captured in Austria. After nearing a busy motorway, Emil was tranquilized, fitted with a GPS tag, and released near the Czech Sumava national park, a natural moose habitat. Austrian officials will track his movements for 30 days. While the capture ensured his safety, animal welfare organizations criticized the lack of transparency in "Operation Emil," advocating for improved wildlife protection and corridors rather than simply relocating animals. The incident has reignited debates on legal treatment of wild animals in Austria.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee expressed caution regarding aggressive interest rate reductions, despite his vote for a recent cut in the central bank's key borrowing rate. He emphasized that future rate adjustments would depend on sustained economic progress, particularly as inflation has remained above the 2% target for over four consecutive years. Goolsbee suggested that rates could gradually decrease if current economic challenges subside, aligning with projections that the neutral rate is around 3.1%. The Fed is closely monitoring both inflation data and the labor market, which Goolsbee's new Chicago Fed monitor indicates is currently stable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England has unveiled its 16-man squad for the Ashes 2025 series against Australia, featuring a notable recall for spinner Will Jacks and the promotion of Harry Brook to vice-captain. Jacks, primarily a batter, will provide backup for Shoaib Bashir, while Brook's new role potentially places Ollie Pope's number three batting position under increased scrutiny. The squad includes a formidable pace-bowling lineup with Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, and Josh Tongue, despite ongoing injury concerns for Wood and captain Ben Stokes. The team aims for continuity under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, hoping to maintain player fitness throughout the five-Test series.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's temporary increase of the federal State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction limit from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025 is expected to yield significant tax benefits, particularly for residents in high-tax states. A Redfin report indicates that itemizers in states like New York, California, and New Jersey could see the largest median savings, while those in South Dakota and Alaska would experience the smallest. This change, which phases out for incomes exceeding $500,000 and reverts to $10,000 in 2030, primarily benefits higher earners who itemize deductions.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area, which posed a severe threat to NYC's telecom systems and the UN General Assembly.

The operation, initiated by telephonic threats to senior U.S. officials, also uncovered illegal firearms and cocaine.

          <p>Experts are offering four key strategies for homebuyers and refinancers to secure lower mortgage rates, especially as the real estate market enters its typically slower season. Primary recommendations include comparing offers from multiple lenders, as rates can vary significantly, and diligently improving one's credit score to qualify for more favorable terms, particularly for conventional loans. Borrowers are also advised to consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or shorter-term loans, which often feature lower initial rates but come with specific trade-offs. Additionally, buying mortgage points can reduce the interest rate upfront, a strategic move beneficial for those planning a long-term stay in their home. (not investment advice)</p>
