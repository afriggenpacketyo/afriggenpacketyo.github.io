          <p>Meta is pursuing legal action against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which utilizes AI to generate nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals.

Senator Dick Durbin had previously urged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to address the issue of CrushAI ads violating Meta's standards on adult nudity and harassment.

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a revival in the United States after decades of decline, driven by increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S. imports over 95% of its uranium despite being the world's largest producer of nuclear power. The Biden administration has banned Russian uranium imports and allocated $2.7 billion to expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity. Experts suggest that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still rely on foreign sources due to limited reserves. </p>
