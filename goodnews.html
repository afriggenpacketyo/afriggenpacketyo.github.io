          <p>Western airlines may experience greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts this summer as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates, forcing carriers to avoid dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. While both Western and Chinese airlines are diverting flights, Western firms face a disadvantage because they are barred from Russian airspace, which Chinese companies continue to use. Analysts suggest that this situation could widen the competitive gap between Chinese and Western airlines, as Chinese carriers have more flexibility in rerouting flights.

          <p>Natalie Fleet, the Labour MP for Bolsover, is campaigning for a law change to remove parental rights from rapists, drawing from her personal experience of being sexually assaulted as a teenager. Fleet aims to amend the Victims and Courts Bill to suspend the parental rights of child rapists, preventing them from making decisions about their children's lives. She has garnered support from ministers and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who was previously unaware that such a law did not exist. Fleet's efforts also have received Royal backing, with Queen Camilla expressing support for the campaign. The Optimism score is not in this summary.</p>

          <h2>China Unveils 'Meteor-1,' Its First Parallel Optical Computing Chip Amid US Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 00:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, marking a significant advancement in using light for simultaneous computations. The chip's theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency rivals Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development is particularly important as US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing offers advantages like ultra-high speed and low power consumption, positioning it as a critical direction for future computing. The Optimism score is not in this summary.</p>

          <h2>Oil Prices Decline After Iran's Strike on US Base Causes No Casualties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 23:59:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, dropping below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, and some analysts suggest this reflects a 'peace through strength' strategy. Trump also thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which helped prevent casualties. The Optimism score is not in this summary. (not investment advice)</p>
