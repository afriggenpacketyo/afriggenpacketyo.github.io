          <p>Kesha responded to fan backlash by replacing the AI-generated cover art for her single "Delusional" with a photograph of herself, taken by Brendan Walter.

Kesha credited her team of human artists for the new cover, emphasizing the importance of considering human ramifications as AI technology advances. "Delusional" is the second single from her upcoming album "Period," marking her first release under her independent label, Kesha Records, after settling her legal battle with Dr. Luke.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now prohibited across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and reduce environmental waste. Shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, but the ban targets disposable vapes, which are considered a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. While vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, the long-term risks are still unknown, and disposable vapes, with their colorful packaging, have contributed to increased vaping among young people. Retailers violating the ban face fines, with the government predicting a significant impact, though health experts call for further regulation to address youth vaping. The optimism score reflects the fact that the ban is meant to protect children's health, and reduce waste.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has cautioned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, may be susceptible to hacking due to slight delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could provide eavesdroppers with opportunities to exploit the system during quantum key distribution (QKD), a method designed to ensure secure communication. Despite the theoretical unhackability of QKD, Miller's analysis of data from Micius revealed vulnerabilities in its experimental implementation. The findings raise concerns about the security of China's quantum communication network and the potential for side-channel attacks.

          <p>The FDA approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and those 12-64 with increased risk, not as a replacement, but a second option. The vaccine uses a lower dose by refining its immune target, but skepticism from Trump administration officials limits its use. Moderna's existing vaccine remains available for anyone 6 months and older, but the company is expected to offer both options this fall. The FDA's approval was based on a study showing the new vaccine's safety and effectiveness. The optimism score reflects the fact that a new vaccine has been approved, but also the limitations on its use.</p>
