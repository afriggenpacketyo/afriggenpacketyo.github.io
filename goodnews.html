          <p>The University of California system has offered admission to its largest-ever class of California undergraduates, increasing in-state first-year admits by over 7% while maintaining strong racial diversity. The move addresses public pressure to prioritize local students, even as the system faces significant budget challenges. UC also increased offers to international students, who pay higher tuition, to offset potential enrollment declines due to new visa vetting and higher fees. Despite a slight dip in total applications, Latinos remained the largest group of admitted Californians for the sixth consecutive year.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by investment fund Azoria Capital that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. The judge also questioned if the lawsuit, brought by a firm whose CEO is a vocal Trump ally and critic of Fed policy, was primarily a publicity stunt. The decision upholds the FOMC's long-standing practice of conducting its policy meetings in private. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent bipartisan meeting of the National Governors Association (NGA) in Colorado Springs highlighted the ongoing split among state leaders on how to engage with President Donald Trump. The gathering, ostensibly focused on public policy, took place against a backdrop of political tension. The presence of Trump administration officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz, underscored the president's influence. The article suggests that governors are navigating a complex political landscape, balancing state interests with their party's relationship to the White House.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a federal lawsuit against unnamed merchants on platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay for allegedly selling counterfeit, Trump-branded merchandise. The complaint accuses the sellers of trademark infringement and deceiving consumers with "inferior imitations" of products such as hats, shirts, and mugs. The company is seeking a court order to stop the sales, destroy the counterfeit goods, and compel the online marketplaces to close the sellers' accounts. The lawsuit comes as sales of Trump-related merchandise have seen a spike.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are hovering around $3,332 per ounce ahead of the Federal Reserve's July meeting, with experts anticipating little change as a rate cut is considered highly unlikely. While lower interest rates historically boost gold prices, the metal's value has recently been driven more by inflation and geopolitical concerns. Investors are advised to watch for comments from the Fed post-meeting, as hints about future policy could influence the market. With ongoing inflation and global tensions, the article suggests that the current price of gold could be a strategic entry point for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps is expanding its role in naval operations by using MV-22 Osprey aircraft to deploy sonobuoys for anti-submarine warfare (ASW). In a recent training exercise, Marines practiced dropping these submersible listening devices, which are used to detect, track, and help target enemy submarines. This development marks a significant step in integrating Marine aviation capabilities with the Navy's traditional ASW mission. Officials noted the Osprey's unique combination of long-range flight and payload capacity makes it a versatile and effective asset for this emerging role.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing high tariffs, Wall Street's fear of a trade war-induced recession is diminishing as the effective tariff rate appears to be settling in a 15-20% range, lower than initially feared. A recent trade deal with the European Union has contributed to this improved outlook, with economists citing a strong global growth backdrop and easing financial conditions. While the risk of a slowdown remains, major firms like JPMorgan Chase have lowered their recession probability. However, analysts caution that the final outcome of trade negotiations, particularly with Japan, remains uncertain and could still negatively impact the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over a provision in a recent tax bill that targeted abortion providers. The judge stated that cutting the funding would likely cause "adverse health consequences" for patients, including reduced access to contraception and STI treatment. This court order protects funding for the organization's nearly 600 health centers across the country while the legal battle continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale, two-year study has provided strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve thinking and memory in older adults. The POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Participants who followed an intensive regimen of a Mediterranean diet, regular aerobic exercise, and cognitive training showed cognitive function scores similar to people one to two years younger. The results suggest that such lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline.</p>
