        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Vietnam have reached a trade agreement that imposes a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports to the U.S., averting a much higher threatened rate of 46%. In return, Vietnam has agreed to provide preferential market access for American goods, including large-engine cars. The deal addresses U.S. concerns about its large trade deficit with Vietnam and accusations of transshipment, where Chinese goods are relabeled as Vietnamese. China has warned that such agreements should not harm the interests of third parties.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, the U.S. government has lifted its export restrictions on chip-design software to China, a move seen as a sign of a potential trade truce. Major semiconductor software companies, including U.S.-based Synopsys and Cadence, confirmed they received notice from the Commerce Department and are restoring full access for their Chinese customers.

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party has published an official tribute to the late Premier Li Keqiang to mark what would have been his 70th birthday. An article attributed to a party history institute praised Li, who died from a heart attack in October 2023, as an "outstanding member of the party" and a "time-tested loyal communist fighter."

          <p>Urban areas can become significantly hotter than their rural surroundings, a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island" effect, which can raise temperatures by 10 to 15 degrees Celsius. This is caused by dark, heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, a lack of cooling vegetation, and urban layouts that trap hot air. The article explains that this effect intensifies heatwaves for the 50% of the world's population living in cities and also outlines potential solutions, including green roofs, reflective pavements, and increased urban green spaces.</p>

According to Coast Guard data, operator inexperience is a leading cause of mishaps, along with overloading boats and failing to use life jackets. The expert strongly recommends that all boaters conduct a safety checklist before departure, carry a VHF radio for emergencies, and obtain basic first-aid training to prevent tragedies and ensure they can be their own first responder.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature has shed light on the origins of the Uralic languages, a family that includes Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. By combining genetic data from ancient individuals with archaeological and linguistic evidence, researchers traced the migration of Uralic-speaking peoples from Siberia across Eurasia. This migration, which began thousands of years ago, spread both the language family and key technological advancements, and the study shows how modern speakers can trace this unique Siberian ancestry in their DNA.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores how the Spanish language evolves globally, arguing that its 600 million speakers are generally more welcoming of variations and new influences than their English-speaking counterparts. The author contrasts the vibrant, cross-pollinating nature of Spanish in the Americas and Spain with the sometimes-rigid debates over dialect in the English-speaking world. The article celebrates this linguistic blending as a source of richness and creativity that keeps the language alive and thriving, despite lingering pockets of accent-based discrimination.</p>
