          <p>Actress Halle Berry has seemingly responded to recent comments made by her ex-husband, former MLB star David Justice, regarding their past marriage. During a podcast appearance, Justice suggested their marriage dissolved because Berry did not cook or clean and didn't seem "motherly." Shortly after, Berry posted photos on Instagram of herself laughing with her current partner, Van Hunt, with the caption, "Phew…! cooking, cleaning and mothering." The couple divorced in 1997 after a four-year marriage, and both have since remarried and have children from other relationships.</p>

          <p>A copy of "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in July 1943. The book was discovered in a deceased man's possessions by his child, who believes their grandmother originally borrowed it before moving to Mexico for an embassy job. The returner included a letter hoping there would be no late fee, which the library estimated could have been almost $900. Fortunately, the library system eliminated late fees in 2021, turning the event into a heartwarming story.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a company backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting an affordable, American-made electric pickup truck by focusing on a simple, customizable design. The base model is a compact, two-seat vehicle that owners can upgrade with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. The company's main selling point is its low price, which was initially advertised as under $20,000 with federal tax credits. With those credits expiring, the price may be closer to $28,000, raising questions about its competitiveness against other models like the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares rallied after a securities filing revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has fueled market speculation that a new round of activist pressure could push for changes to improve the stock's lagging performance. Starboard's previous campaign in 2022-2023, which called for greater efficiency, was highly successful and led to a significant stock price increase. Analysts suggest the renewed interest may signal pressure on management to refocus on core growth and margin expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in demonstrations against Atlanta's police training center, known as 'Cop City.' The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment for two and a half years. Marsicano's attorney argued that the state was purposefully delaying the process as a form of punishment. This decision marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including RICO conspiracy indictments, from the state.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that cloves, a common kitchen spice, may offer several health benefits, including helping to lower blood sugar and improve oral health. The spice contains eugenol, a compound with natural antimicrobial properties that can help control plaque and kill harmful bacteria and fungi in the mouth. A 2019 study found that participants taking clove extract daily had significantly lower blood sugar after meals. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like calcium and magnesium and act as a natural antioxidant, though clove oil should be used with caution due to its potency.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class, who all vanish from their homes one night. The movie follows the community's attempt to understand the senseless tragedy, focusing on a grieving father (Josh Brolin) and a teacher (Julia Garner). Unlike many mystery-box films, this article suggests "Weapons" provides clear answers, revealing a supernatural villain whose defeat offers a moment of cinematic catharsis. However, the film also underscores that vanquishing the evil does not erase the trauma it caused, leaving a lasting sense of grief and loss.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a government stake in struggling chipmaker Intel to bolster national security and reduce reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing. The news caused Intel's stock to climb over 6%. An analyst from D.A. Davidson called the potential intervention "essential," arguing that the U.S. cannot depend on other countries for critical technology like advanced chips, especially with the rise of superintelligent AI. The White House could potentially use funds from the CHIPS Act to structure such a deal, though no official plan has been announced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that nearly 60% of U.S. adults consider paying down credit card debt a primary financial goal, as average interest rates approach 22%. With national credit card debt exceeding $1.2 trillion, many Americans are feeling the strain, and about 45% are currently carrying balances on more than one card. This highlights a growing awareness of the financial burden of high-rate debt. Various strategies can help manage this debt, including debt management plans, credit counseling, hardship programs, and consolidation loans, which can simplify payments and reduce overall interest costs.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The story centers on a charismatic and unconventional teacher in 1930s Edinburgh and her profound influence on a select group of her students. While the narrative follows the girls' adolescence, its central concern is their moral education and relationship with their teacher, who they view as a deity-like figure. The article highlights Spark's realistic portrayal of how a magnetic personality can shape a young person's life, even long after they have grown up and forged their own path.</p>

          <h2>A Definitive Ranking of Film and Television Adaptations of John Grisham's Novels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 13:10:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive ranking of the film and television adaptations of John Grisham's legal thrillers, from best to worst. The list evaluates each adaptation based on its quality and how well it captures the essence of Grisham's signature underdog stories. The 1993 film "The Pelican Brief," starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, is ranked as the best, praised for its charismatic leads and careful plotting. In contrast, the 2012 television series sequel to "The Firm" is placed at the bottom of the list, criticized for its slow, sputtering narrative that failed to translate Grisham's propulsive style.</p>
