          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who has been notably private about his personal life, recently revealed that his new sister-in-law offered advice regarding his decision to sign with the team. While maintaining the privacy of his wife, Brittani, Rodgers mentioned taking counsel from her 20-year-old sister, whom he jokingly called the "brains of the family." This comment comes after Rodgers previously expressed frustration with media intrusion into his private life, emphasizing his wife's desire to remain out of the public eye while he focuses on what could be his final NFL season.</p>

This evolution builds on a century-long legacy that began with the establishment of communities in towns like Oak Bluffs.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 17:25:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has issued a ruling that significantly limits the scope for mass compensation claims related to hidden commissions in car finance deals, a relief for lenders who feared billions in payouts. The court rejected the argument that car dealers have a fiduciary duty to buyers, which would have made most undisclosed commissions illegal. However, the ruling did find one specific agreement "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act due to a very large commission, potentially providing a template for other claims. A separate regulatory review into discretionary commission arrangements could still result in substantial redress for consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling could curtail a controversial practice where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest these migrants at their court hearings for immediate removal. The judge noted the plaintiffs had "played by the rules" and that applying expedited removal raised a "question of fair play." This decision may temporarily shield hundreds of thousands of migrants, many from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who were paroled into the country under Biden-era programs.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to strategically use long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in high returns. This article suggests savers should first determine the maximum amount they can deposit for an extended period without risking early withdrawal penalties. It also recommends using this time to shop around, particularly at online banks which often offer higher rates. Finally, savers should re-evaluate where other funds are held, as moving money from low-yield traditional accounts into high-rate CDs could significantly boost earnings over time.

          <h2>Ohio Couple Welcomes Baby from Embryo Frozen for Over 30 Years</h2>

          <p>A baby boy was born in Ohio from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years, likely setting a new record for the longest storage time before a successful birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, involved Linda and Tim Pierce receiving embryos that were created via IVF and donated in 1994. This event highlights the growing practice of donating unused frozen embryos, a topic that intersects with complex ethical and legal discussions, especially as an estimated 1.5 million embryos remain in storage across the U.S.</p>

          <p>Shares of the design software company Figma rose over 5% in their second day of trading, building on a hugely successful stock market debut. The company's stock more than tripled on its first day on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $115.50 after being priced at $33 per share. Figma's strong public offering follows an extended drought in tech IPOs and comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe fell through in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. The performance signals strong investor confidence in the company's future as a standalone entity.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Some Monogamous Bird Species 'Divorce' Between Breeding Seasons</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 16:04:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Oxford University has found that some European songbirds, which are typically monogamous, will effectively "divorce" their partners between breeding seasons. The research observed that these birds, while paired for raising one brood of chicks, do not always reunite with the same partner for the next season. This behavior challenges the long-held understanding of monogamy in certain avian species. The findings provide new insights into the complex social and mating strategies that birds employ to maximize their reproductive success from one year to the next.</p>

          <p>In an interview, the economist who originally coined the acronym BRIC (later BRICS) to describe the rising economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China reflects on how the concept has evolved. He discusses the transformation of his economic grouping into a formal geopolitical alliance that has since expanded to include other nations. The conversation also explores the reasons behind the significant animosity that President Trump has directed towards the alliance. The discussion provides context on the bloc's origins as a financial concept and its current role as a political counterweight on the world stage.</p>
