          <p>Mexico has won its record-extending 10th CONCACAF Gold Cup championship, defeating the United States 2-1 in a competitive final. The U.S. team took an early lead with a goal from Chris Richards, but Mexico equalized before halftime and secured the winning goal in the 77th minute. The victory marks a successful title defense for Mexico's full-strength squad, while the U.S. team, competing without several of its top European-based players, fell short of winning its eighth title. The match highlighted Mexico's continued dominance in the regional tournament.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Fuzhou University in China have developed a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light faster than the human eye. The new system is designed to mimic the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and remember those settings for faster future adaptation. This technological advancement also aims to overcome the limitations of current systems by enabling quicker computation while consuming less energy. The research represents a significant step forward in neuromorphic engineering and advanced sensor technology.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of the BRICS nations issued a statement calling for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. The group emphasized that while AI presents a significant opportunity for inclusive growth, it could also widen the digital divide without fair governance. They proposed developing UN-led technical standards to ensure trust and security across AI platforms and advocated for open-source collaboration and equitable access to AI technologies for developing nations. The statement also included voluntary guidelines for the responsible, non-military use of AI.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire so far this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather conditions and an influx of personnel have helped increase containment to 30 percent. The fire, which started near the border of Santa Barbara County, is threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species, and has prompted mandatory evacuations. While crews are optimistic, a looming midweek heat wave could present new challenges in the ongoing battle to control the blaze.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve without worrying about their job. The proposed extension, which will provide for at least one week of leave, has been welcomed by campaigners and support organizations as a vital step in acknowledging the impact of early-stage pregnancy loss.</p>

Currently, only about one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher. The plan also includes proposals for more frequent Ofsted inspections of nurseries to help drive up standards and give young children a better start.</p>

          <p>The Green River Drift in Wyoming stands as the longest-running cattle drive in the United States, a 70-mile journey undertaken by a small group of ranchers each spring. This 125-year-old tradition was born out of necessity after a brutal winter, allowing ranchers to move cattle to high-country pastures to graze while hay is grown in the valley below. Despite facing modern challenges like government regulations, predators, and changing economic landscapes, families continue the demanding work. They are driven by a deep connection to the land and a commitment to preserving a way of life passed down through generations.</p>
