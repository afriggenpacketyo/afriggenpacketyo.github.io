          <p>The Detroit Tigers have advanced to the American League Division Series after defeating the Cleveland Guardians 6-3 in the final game of their Wild Card Series. A key sixth-inning home run by Dillon Dingler and a four-run rally in the seventh inning secured the victory for Detroit on the road. This marks the second consecutive season the Tigers have won a Wild Card Series away from home. They will now face the Seattle Mariners in the next round of the MLB playoffs, while the AL Central champion Guardians' season comes to an end after a historic mid-season comeback.</p>

          <p>California's Department of Motor Vehicles has begun issuing newly redesigned driver's licenses and identification cards that include enhanced security features to combat counterfeiting. The new design replaces the previous imagery with scenes of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline. Key security upgrades include a first-in-the-nation digital signature embedded in one of the barcodes on the back of the card. Officials clarified that current licenses remain valid until their expiration date, so there is no need for motorists to rush to the DMV to obtain the new version.</p>

          <p>Stable Recovery, a rehabilitation program at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky, is helping men overcome drug and alcohol addiction by providing them with work caring for thoroughbred horses. The yearlong, 12-step program offers a structured environment where participants develop a sense of purpose and honesty while learning valuable skills for a career in the horse industry. Co-founded by individuals in recovery themselves, the program is free for participants and addresses both addiction and a labor shortage in the equine world. The unique bond formed between the men and the horses is described as a "secret sauce" for healing and personal transformation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a deal with pharmaceutical company Pfizer to reduce the cost of its drugs in the United States, aligning them with the lower prices charged in other developed nations. This agreement marks a significant victory for President Trump, who has long criticized drugmakers for overcharging Americans. The deal was reportedly secured after the administration threatened to impose 100% tariffs on pharmaceutical companies that do not manufacture some of their products in the U.S. While the immediate impact on consumers is still unclear, the move has broken the industry's united front against such pricing policies.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at the Evolution and Influence of College Rankings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 17:38:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the history of college rankings in America, from an informal 1934 list in The Atlantic that caused a storm of controversy to the modern dominance of the U.S. News & World Report list. Early attempts at ranking were often suppressed due to backlash from universities. However, as higher education became a mass-consumer good after World War II, the demand for such guides grew. The U.S. News rankings, which began in 1983, capitalized on this demand and have since become a powerful force, shaping public perception, institutional behavior, and the anxieties of the American meritocracy.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that viewing China's economy solely through a lens of stagnation misses a profound transformation led by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Unlike their predecessors who relied on informal networks, this cohort, born in the 1960s to 1980s, is technically trained, innovative, and experienced in market dynamics. These business leaders are driving competitiveness and global integration, restructuring the economy from within. The article suggests that this entrepreneurial resilience is a key, often overlooked, aspect of China's ongoing development and its ability to navigate current economic challenges.</p>

          <p>A mother on TikTok has described how her son, a long-time Donald Trump supporter, turned against the former president after watching his speech at the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The son was reportedly disturbed by Trump's focus on his political enemies and personal grievances during an event intended for mourning, viewing it as a moment of selfishness. This realization, which the mother called his "come-to-Jesus moment," ended years of political tension within their family. The story highlights a personal perspective on the public reaction to Trump's conduct following the politically charged assassination.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered over 1,000 gold and silver coins worth an estimated $1 million from a Spanish shipwreck off the coast of Florida. The treasure belongs to a fleet of ships that sank during a hurricane in 1715 while transporting wealth from the colonies back to Spain. The salvage company, 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels LLC, announced that the coins, minted in what are now Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru, are remarkably well-preserved. This significant find provides a tangible link to the history of the Spanish empire's golden age and the perils of transatlantic voyages.</p>

          <p>Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams has explicitly confirmed that a lyric in her song "Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party" refers to country star Morgan Wallen. In the song, she sings about being at a "racist country singer's bar," and in a recent podcast interview, she stated, "I’m always talking about Morgan Wallen." Wallen faced controversy in 2021 after being filmed using a racial slur and subsequently opened a large bar in Nashville. Williams, who grew up in Tennessee, has been increasingly vocal about racial issues and religious hypocrisy in the South through her music.</p>

          <p>An essay explores the history and spiritual significance of Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean religion often misunderstood and demonized in Western cultures. Originating with enslaved Yoruba people in Cuba, Lucumí was an act of resistance and a way to preserve ancestral traditions by syncretizing them with Catholicism. Scholars explain that the religion is centered on achieving balance, wellness, and connection to nature through deities called orishas, not on "black magic" as stereotypes suggest. The practice emphasizes community care and survival, offering tools for holistic health in a world that has historically been hostile to its practitioners.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Kardashian's ex-boyfriend, singer Ray J, for publicly claiming they are under a federal criminal racketeering (RICO) investigation. The lawsuit asserts that Ray J's statements, made in a documentary and on a livestream, are "blatantly false" and have caused significant reputational harm. Ray J linked the Kardashian family to the high-profile sex-trafficking case against Sean "Diddy" Combs, alleging their supposed RICO case is "worse." The legal action seeks to stop the spread of these accusations, which the plaintiffs describe as a sensationalized attempt by Ray J to gain public attention.</p>
