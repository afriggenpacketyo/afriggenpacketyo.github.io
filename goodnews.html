          <p>Apple has announced a plan to increase its spending with U.S. companies by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. The investment includes a $2.5 billion expansion with Corning, which manufactures iPhone glass in Kentucky, ensuring all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches is U.S.-made. This announcement comes as Apple navigates increased tariffs on Chinese imports and shifts some assembly operations to other countries like India to mitigate costs. CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to discuss the plans with President Trump, continuing a pattern of U.S. investment announcements under political pressure.</p>

          <p>DoorDash reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue, which caused its stock to rise in extended trading. The company announced revenue of $3.28 billion and a net income of $285 million, a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. Total orders grew by 20% year-over-year, indicating sustained consumer demand for food delivery services. The positive report also reflects the company's recent strategic acquisitions, including British delivery service Deliveroo, as it continues to invest in new categories and international markets.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several strategies for homeowners looking to secure a lower interest rate on a home equity loan amidst a landscape of relatively high borrowing costs. It suggests improving personal financial health by boosting credit scores and lowering debt-to-income ratios to become a more attractive borrower. The article also recommends monitoring economic data release dates, as market fluctuations can create brief opportunities to lock in better rates. Finally, it advises homeowners to shop around and encourage lenders to compete for their business to find the best possible terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a dramatic finish in The Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave clinched a one-wicket victory against the Manchester Originals with just one ball to spare. Chasing a target of 132, the Brave were in a difficult position before late-game heroics from tailenders Tymal Mills and Craig Overton turned the tide. After Mills was dismissed with three runs needed, last-man Reece Topley hit a boundary on his first ball to win the match. Earlier in the game, Mills had also excelled with the ball, taking three key wickets to help restrict the Originals' total.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced it will increase its investment in the U.S. by an additional $100 billion, a move that comes amid significant pressure from President Donald Trump to onshore more of its manufacturing. This pledge is expected to encourage more of Apple's suppliers to produce components domestically. The announcement follows Trump's threats to impose higher tariffs on Apple products if the company did not shift its production away from China. While analysts note that a major supply chain overhaul will take time, the commitment may help Apple receive more favorable treatment from the White House on trade issues.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the state of the public defender system in New Orleans, reflecting on how Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while a catastrophe, ultimately became a catalyst for desperately needed reforms. In the storm's aftermath, the city's court system collapsed, leaving incarcerated individuals in a state of limbo and exposing the deep flaws in public defense. However, the destruction also cleared the way for a complete overhaul. Two decades later, the report finds a system that has been vastly improved, transforming from one of the nation's worst into a more functional and just model.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock soared 21% after the e-commerce platform reported second-quarter results that beat expectations and provided a very strong forecast for the third quarter. The company's revenue grew 31% year-over-year, and its CFO stated that the anticipated negative impact from U.S. tariffs "did not materialize." This performance suggests that the millions of small businesses using Shopify's platform have successfully navigated the trade war, with many raising prices without seeing a drop in consumer demand.

          <p>Amazon's self-driving vehicle unit, Zoox, has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle that will allow it to move forward with demonstrations of its robotaxis. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) granted Zoox a first-of-its-kind exemption from some federal motor vehicle safety standards for its purpose-built autonomous vehicles. As part of the decision, NHTSA also closed a safety probe into Zoox's self-certification process that began in 2023. This regulatory approval is a major step for the company as it prepares to launch a commercial ride-hailing service in Las Vegas.</p>
