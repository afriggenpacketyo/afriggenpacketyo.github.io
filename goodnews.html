          <p>A federal judge has ordered Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil to be released on bail, more than three months after his detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or threat to his community and could be released during immigration proceedings. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in New York on March 8, sparking demonstrations. The government has accused Khalil of failing to disclose information when he applied for lawful permanent residency in 2024, while his attorneys argue that the government is violating his free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with the initial rides using the Model Y. Access to the vehicles and rides will be by invitation only, with some influencers reporting early access invites. The service will exclude trips to or from airports and may be limited or unavailable due to bad weather, with a Tesla Safety Monitor sitting in the front passenger seat. The rides are limited to a geofenced area of the city, and remote drivers will be monitoring as a backup. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated on social media that his administration is close to reaching a deal with Harvard University, with an announcement likely next week. Trump noted that Harvard has acted appropriately during negotiations and appears committed to doing what is right. This announcement coincided with a federal judge granting a preliminary injunction that would continue blocking the president's efforts to bar international students from attending Harvard University. The Trump administration has taken actions around Harvard's international students, including disqualifying them from receiving visas. </p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he could strike a "deal" with Harvard University within days, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The preliminary injunction bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The Department of Homeland Security had told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to deal with campus antisemitism. The battle over international students could have grave consequences for Harvard, where about one in four students hail from outside the United States.</p>

          <p>Meta approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI about a potential takeover bid before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI. The two companies did not finalize a deal, with one person familiar with the talks saying it was "mutually dissolved," while another said Perplexity walked away. Meta's attempt to purchase Perplexity serves as the latest example of Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive push to bolster his company's AI efforts. Zuckerberg has grown agitated that rivals like OpenAI appear to be ahead in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing apps.</p>

Interim CEO Ron Sargent said Kroger is catering to value-minded shoppers by simplifying promotions, lowering prices, and emphasizing private brands. The company said it will close about 60 stores over the next 18 months, leading to a $100 million impairment charge in the first quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

Stablecoins are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era crypto policies. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a regulatory framework for the use of stablecoins, potentially upgrading dollar payment rails and promoting dollar dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
