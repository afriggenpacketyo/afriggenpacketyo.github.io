          <p>Arsenal has completed the significant signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a deal valued at £60 million, including performance-related add-ons. The 27-year-old, who previously started his youth career with the Gunners, chose to return to his boyhood club despite Tottenham having already agreed to terms with both Palace and Eze. Arsenal's sporting director lauded Eze as a "creative and explosive talent with huge technical quality," while manager Mikel Arteta emphasized his power, intelligence, and ambition as a player who has worked hard throughout his career. This acquisition is Arsenal's seventh summer signing, aiming to bolster their attacking options and provide a new dimension to their team.</p>

Head coach Shane Beamer confirmed that Robertson, currently in his third year as a Gamecocks assistant, is expected to make a full recovery. Sources indicate the 36-year-old sustained a "significant lower leg injury" and underwent ankle surgery following a reported head-on collision.

This market reaction suggests investors are optimistic about lower rates benefiting broader economic sectors.

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures reaching 30C on Bank Holiday Monday, marking what is expected to be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell, driven by the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air, will be short-lived, with unsettled weather expected from Tuesday. Large crowds are anticipated for events like Notting Hill Carnival and music festivals. However, potential travel delays and cancellations due to rail strikes and engineering works could affect those planning to enjoy the hot weather. The RNLI has also issued warnings for beachgoers regarding rough seas.</p>

          <p>Berlin has officially renamed a central street, formerly known as "Mohrenstrasse" (Moor Street), to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse, honoring the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate in 1734. This change, initially approved in 2020, faced legal challenges from residents but was upheld by the Higher Administrative Court. The article explains the M-word's racist connotations, stemming from historical practices of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany. The renaming, coinciding with International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, is seen as a significant act of decolonization and recognition of Black history and resilience.</p>

          <p>A 66-year-old individual, Alex, who gave a year's notice for retirement, is now being asked by his employer to stay on for two months as a part-time consultant to train his replacement. The company hired the replacement only weeks before Alex's planned retirement, creating a time crunch. The article advises Alex to consider how this extension could impact his retirement benefits, such as Social Security, which might be temporarily reduced if he earns above a certain cap before his full retirement age. Delaying Social Security claims, however, could increase future monthly benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>College athletics are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from casual club activities to highly professionalized endeavors, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and men's basketball. Recent court rulings have allowed athletes to receive compensation from advertisers, fans, and their schools, fundamentally altering their status. This shift means college athletes' careers and the overall experience of college-level sports are evolving. The article explores the implications, including the potential for niche sports to decline as resources are increasingly directed towards financially lucrative programs, and the debate around whether athletes should be considered workers.</p>

          <p>Restaurateur Tommy Fello, 71, experienced significant paralysis in his left arm and leg after a stroke, with traditional therapy yielding only minor improvements. A new FDA-approved implant, the Vivistim System, which uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation, has dramatically improved his hand and arm function. The device enhances neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to rewire itself, leading to greater and faster motor function improvements for stroke survivors. Fello, the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant, has seen remarkable progress, indicating a promising future for stroke recovery technologies.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a more formal attire for his recent White House meeting with President Trump, wearing a black canvas blazer over a collared shirt instead of his usual bunker-chic Henley. This sartorial choice, described as "wardrobe diplomacy," aimed to signal a serious conversation, contrasting with a previous combative meeting where Trump criticized his casual dress. The article highlights how clothing can convey powerful messages in politics, citing historical examples like Winston Churchill's air-raid suit. Zelenskyy's changed look contributed to what he called "the best one" yet, suggesting attire can indeed influence diplomatic interactions.</p>
