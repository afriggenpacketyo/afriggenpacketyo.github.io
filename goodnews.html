          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) regained control of their headquarters after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover "null and void." The ruling followed a two-month legal battle that began after USIP employees were forcibly removed from the building by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. The judge's decision invalidated President Trump's executive order that declared USIP "unnecessary" and terminated its leadership and staff. The USIP, established by Congress, aims to provide analysis and resources for peace efforts worldwide.</p>

          <p>Tech and music industry leaders testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, advocating for the passage of the No Fakes Act to protect against AI deepfakes.

The No Fakes Act seeks to hold individuals or companies liable for producing unauthorized digital replicas, while also protecting First Amendment rights and establishing a process for victims to remove deepfakes from online platforms.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, which has faced criticism for its lack of clarity. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. While the bill does not expand abortion access or list specific medical exceptions, it represents a shift for Texas Republicans, who have previously defended the law as written. Democrats have called the bill a positive step, but some abortion-rights advocates remain skeptical about its impact.</p>

Starmer's decision to reinstate winter fuel payments for pensioners after facing pressure from Labour MPs is described as a "U-turn" and a "partial climbdown." Trump's meeting with Ramaphosa, during which he presented a video alleging the persecution of white farmers, is characterized as an "ambush" and a "white genocide" claim.

A team at Harvard University has found a pair of drugs which can successfully rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim. The researchers say that approach is "no longer cutting it" so that they should try to kill parasites in the mosquito.</p>
