          <p>Kyoto saw a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, totaling 56.06 million visitors overall, yet satisfaction levels remained high among both foreign and Japanese tourists. Temples, shrines, and historical sites like Kiyomizu temple and Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine were popular attractions, however Japanese visitors reported more dissatisfaction due to crowds and public transportation issues. To address overtourism, Kyoto is set to implement a lodging tax increase in 2026, with revenues allocated to strengthening measures against overtourism, as the city aims to balance tourism with resident quality of life. The survey, conducted over four periods in 2024, gathered responses from over 5,500 visitors to understand their experiences and satisfaction levels.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is under renewed scrutiny as Japan approaches its first zero giant panda moment in over half a century. With current pandas set to return to China, experts speculate on whether new pandas will be loaned to Japan amid Sino-U.S. rivalry. China's decisions on panda loans are often revealed during high-level bilateral talks, with a new loan potentially announced during a visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan, as the symbolic gesture of friendship is tied to political and economic relations between the two countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As artificial intelligence usage grows rapidly, cases of harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements, are increasing, compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing. Researchers emphasize the need for more robust evaluation methods like red teaming, involving diverse individuals testing AI systems to uncover potential harm. Standardized AI flaw reports, incentives, and information dissemination are recommended to improve risk assessment. Marrying user-centered practices with governance and policy can ensure a better understanding of AI risks, promoting responsible AI development and deployment.</p>

          <h2>Effective Parenting Involves Avoiding Certain Phrases, Says Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that parents who avoid defiance do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, but instead use language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that respects a child's autonomy fosters natural cooperation. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and framing requests positively rather than using threats, as these shifts create a safer emotional environment, and children thrive when they feel respected and involved.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England for eligible patients, but only those who meet very strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources, and it is available for people with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and four out of five specified conditions. Some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand will outstrip supply, while the NHS plans to expand access to more people in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race, further straining his minority government. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, won the most seats, indicating the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies. The LDP took 22 seats, falling below the previous record-low of 23, as the election results signal potential challenges for Ishiba's leadership in the upcoming national vote.</p>

          <p>China has become a global leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric, as this transformation has been driven by government planning, vast subsidies, and the development of a comprehensive EV ecosystem. Chinese EV makers like BYD are now leading the global market, and the government's long-term planning and funding have allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production. Despite concerns about unfair business practices, China's EV industry is thriving, driven by fierce competition and innovation, as the Chinese government is also providing policy support, consumer encouragement and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment resistant depression. This move comes after a private clinic in Lanarkshire began offering ketamine assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression last summer. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has previously urged caution over the use of ketamine therapy but it is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine, as the NHS hopes to make the treatment more widely available.</p>
