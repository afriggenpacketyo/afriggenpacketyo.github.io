          <p>Experts suggest that embracing wild lawns, as part of movements like "Let It Bloom June," may offer unexpected health benefits. Physically demanding lawn work can lead to muscle strains, back pain, and joint injuries, while chemical pesticides and herbicides pose risks when airborne. Mental health professionals also agree that natural environments promote mindfulness and well-being. Letting nature reclaim the yard could mean fewer chemicals and health hazards, and gardening promotes mindfulness and can lower cortisol levels.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance has delayed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to multiple weather delays. The launch, originally scheduled for Friday, is now set for June 16, and it will carry another 27 satellites into orbit, bringing the total constellation size to 54. Amazon aims to accelerate satellite deployments to begin delivering service to customers later this year, competing with SpaceX's Starlink.

          <p>A recent survey reveals a surprising increase in the belief of ‚Äúlove at first sight,‚Äù with 60 percent of single American adults endorsing the concept, a nearly 30 percent increase from 2014. Researchers attribute this rise to the prevalence of swipe-based dating apps, which encourage quick judgments about potential partners. While some psychologists acknowledge the possibility of instant connections, they caution that passionate love differs from compassionate love and that initial feelings do not guarantee lasting relationships. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey indicates that singles haven't given up on romantic idealism.</p>

Disney is set to finalize its acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu by July 24, resolving a prolonged dispute over Hulu's valuation. With complete control, Iger said Disney will have better bundling capabilities, a key element to the company's overall streaming strategy, as users can already access Hulu content on the Disney+ app. He also noted that bundling ultimately results in increased engagement, greater advertiser opportunities, lower churn and reduced customer acquisition costs, thereby increasing overall margins.</p>
