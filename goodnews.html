          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery plans to divide into two separate public companies by next year, focusing on streaming/studios and global networks, respectively. CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head the global networks business. This move reflects the industry's shift from cable to streaming, with Comcast similarly separating its traditional pay-TV networks. The company aims to empower its iconic brands with sharper focus and strategic flexibility to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape. The split is expected to be completed by mid-2026.</p>
