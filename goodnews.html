        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Detroit Police Sergeant Shannon Jones, inspired by photos of missing persons, initiated Operation UNITED, exhuming unidentified crime victims to obtain DNA for solving cold cases. Partnering with FBI agent Leslie Larsen, they navigated dusty files and utilized advanced DNA technology to identify remains buried in "paupers' graves." This initiative has led to 33 positive identifications, bringing closure to grieving families, including Kristina Morris, whose father's murder was solved after his remains were identified. Other cities are now seeking to replicate Operation UNITED, underscoring its potential impact on resolving missing persons cases nationwide. The success of Operation UNITED highlights the importance of restoring victims' humanity by giving them back their names and stories. </p>

          <p>The city of Xian, known for its Terracotta Army, is experiencing a surge in tourism, fueled by government promotions of traditional Chinese culture. This has led to the growth of a cottage industry centered around hanfu, traditional Chinese clothing, with tourists renting and wearing the costumes for photoshoots at historical sites. This industry employs costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers, providing new job opportunities for young people like Chang Youli, a hanfu stylist who now runs her own studio. Last year, Xian saw 306 million tourist trips, generating 376 billion yuan in tourism income, highlighting the economic impact of this cultural trend.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the UK, accidentally dropping the document and initially misidentifying it as an agreement with the European Union. He stated that the agreement was not much different from one signed in May and praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom and provided details on steel and aluminum provisions. The President concluded the meeting by complimenting Prime Minister Starmer on his job performance.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza performed a Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," known as ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, despite initial resistance from the baseball organization. Nezza's decision was influenced by ongoing immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, aiming to show solidarity with the Latino community. Her performance has sparked renewed interest in Clotilde Arias, the Latina composer who created the official Spanish translation of the anthem in 1945 at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Arias' work was largely forgotten until rediscovered in 2006, highlighting her contribution to American patriotism and Latino history.</p>

          <p>The capsizing and subsequent relaunch of a North Korean warship offers insights into Kim Jong Un's regime. Kim's immediate denouncement of the failure as a "criminal act" and the swift repair of the ship demonstrate North Korea's commitment to building a nuclear-armed navy. Experts believe Kim is shifting away from concealing unpleasant truths, using the incident to strengthen loyalty to the regime and its ideology. The rapid relaunch of the warship, completed in just over three weeks, defied expectations and showcased the regime's ability to turn a failure into a political success.</p>
