          <h2>UK Explores Establishing Overseas Return Hubs for Asylum Seekers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 07:09:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is in discussions with several countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for failed asylum seekers, according to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. These hubs would house asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected and who have no further routes of appeal in the UK. This proposal differs from the previous Rwanda scheme, which involved processing asylum claims in the African country. The UK government views these return hubs as an important innovation in tackling illegal immigration and organized crime, though Starmer admits they are not a "silver bullet."</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned that consumers will likely start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite Walmart's commitment to everyday low prices. The retailer narrowly missed quarterly sales estimates but maintained its full-year forecast. Walmart also reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, driven by online advertising and its third-party marketplace. Rainey noted that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too significant for retailers and suppliers to absorb, and the company is preparing for net sales to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter.</p>

          <p>Airlines faced a record number of passenger complaints in 2024, according to a report by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, with 66,675 complaints lodged against U.S. airlines. The surge in complaints is attributed to issues such as flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage, with customers seeking refunds and reimbursements. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints, the worst cancellation record, and the worst record for on-time arrivals. New rules adopted in 2024 require airlines to provide automatic refunds for canceled or significantly delayed flights, potentially adding pressure on carriers.</p>

          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has voiced skepticism about banning the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), which secured second place in February's federal election. Merz emphasized the need for concrete proof that the AfD is actively undermining Germany's liberal and democratic order. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor," pending a legal appeal. While most Germans believe the AfD's agenda opposes democracy, the best approach to dealing with the party remains a divisive issue.</p>

Chinese investments in Hungary are significant, with a large percentage of capital pumped into Europe in 2023 going into the country.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco recommends simple ways to increase fiber intake to aid in disease prevention, weight loss, lowering cholesterol, and improving digestion. Adding berries and ground flaxseed to yogurt for breakfast, packing a sandwich with extra lettuce and tomatoes for lunch, and snacking on vegetables with hummus or nuts are easy ways to boost fiber consumption. Harvard Medical School data shows that increasing fiber intake from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes by 16% to 24%. DeCicco also provides a recipe for fiber-filled energy balls.</p>

          <p>As Generation X and millennials enter their 40s and 50s, they're seeking treatment for perimenopause symptoms, which can include rage, fatigue, mood swings, and memory loss. Unlike menopause, perimenopause can be hard to pinpoint, and there's no definitive test. Doctors often suggest testing for other conditions first, as autoimmune diseases and thyroid problems can mimic perimenopause symptoms. Hormone therapy can help manage severe symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings, but it's not without risks and doesn't work for everyone, and experts stress the importance of healthy aging habits.</p>

          <p>Private school fees in the UK have risen by 22.6% on average in January compared to a year ago, following the introduction of VAT on private school fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) expects a reduction in pupils applying to private schools as a result of the VAT changes. While the government predicted a 10% increase, the ISC argues that the sector has been hit by a "triple whammy" of national insurance changes, an end to charitable business rates relief, and the VAT on fees. Some parents have already withdrawn their children from private schools due to the increased costs.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after experiencing stronger-than-expected growth in the first three months of the year. The 0.7% growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts caution that this growth rate may not continue due to impending US tariffs and increased employer taxes. The Labour government aims to boost the economy but faces criticism over the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions. The Bank of England recently lowered UK interest rates, hinting at further cuts.</p>

          <p>China has launched the first batch of satellites for its space computing constellation, the Three-Body Computing Constellation, which aims to create a space-based supercomputer. Once fully deployed, the constellation is projected to have a computing capacity of 1,000 peta operations per second (POPS), rivaling ground-based supercomputers. Orbital data centers can utilize solar power and radiate heat to space, reducing energy needs and carbon footprint. Space historian Jonathan McDowell noted that the concept of cloud computing in space is becoming increasingly popular.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a decline after the Chinese e-commerce giant missed earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter. While revenue increased 7% year-on-year, net income fell short of expectations. The company faced macroeconomic volatility affecting consumer sentiment in China and intense price wars with rivals like PDD and JD.com. Investors are closely watching Alibaba's investments in artificial intelligence, including the launch of its open-source large language model, Qwen 3. The company's core Taobao and Tmall group division saw revenue rise 9%.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated that Germany supports U.S. President Donald Trump's call for NATO members to increase their defense spending target to 5% of their GDP.

Trump has consistently urged NATO members to increase their defense contributions. Wadephul met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss foreign affairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Pennsylvania federal judge ruled that President Trump is legally allowed to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua. The judge defined a "predatory incursion" as a "hostile entry into the United States by a cohesive group," like a U.S.-designated terrorist group. However, the judge also stated that the administration must give people facing Alien Enemies Act removal at least 21 days' notice to bring court challenges. This ruling is unusual, as judges in other states have blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in their court districts.</p>
