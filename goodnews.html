The event included performances by drag queens and the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, with the conductor reminding the audience that many people do not feel safe to live and love openly.

          <p>Annuities can provide predictable retirement income by converting a lump sum into guaranteed monthly payments, but payouts vary based on factors like age, gender, and investment amount. Single-life immediate fixed annuities offer payments that begin right after purchase and continue for life. Generally, older individuals receive larger monthly payments, and men typically receive higher payouts than women due to differing life expectancies. Consulting with a financial advisor can help determine if an annuity is a suitable addition to a retirement portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
