          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale centers on addressing extreme weather conditions exacerbated by climate change, such as heat waves and floods, and how cities can adapt. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for a collective intelligence to rethink the built environment and incorporate solutions from various disciplines. The exhibition highlights the urgency of adapting building approaches, noting the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on vulnerable populations. The event showcases climate-adapted designs, like the redesign of Paul-Arnsberg-Platz in Frankfurt, and advocates for a global construction revolution to create more resilient and habitable cities.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia, has made a remarkable comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Collaborating with musician James Dupr√©, Travis has released two new songs, 'Where That Came From' and 'Horses in Heaven,' and has extended his 'More Life Tour' into fall 2025. AI was used to model Travis's voice using raw vocals from his past recordings, allowing him to continue creating music despite his condition. Travis's wife, Mary, emphasizes the creative process involved, highlighting that it took eleven months to perfect one song, and that AI has been 'wonderful' for her husband.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to launch a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip represents Nvidia's effort to sustain its presence in China, a critical market, amid tightening restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology. The modified chip will feature significant downgrades from the original H20, including substantially reduced memory capacity, to comply with new technical thresholds set by U.S. officials. Despite these adjustments, Nvidia aims to provide Chinese customers with AI capabilities while adhering to regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs ‚Äî and the threat of the levies ‚Äî as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower being dismantled as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire was damaged when the top portion contacted power lines during a helicopter lift. The incident occurred near the Gould substation in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, and the tower was being removed for testing to determine the cause of the fire. While the official cause is still under investigation, a leading theory suggests induction from reenergized lines may have sparked the fire.</p>
