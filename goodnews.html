        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines is set to return to New York's JFK International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways, named Blue Sky, which will allow customers of both airlines to earn frequent flyer miles and enjoy reciprocal loyalty benefits such as priority boarding and roomier seats. The partnership aims to enhance JetBlue's competitiveness against larger airlines like United and Delta, stopping short of the flight coordination seen in JetBlue's previous alliance with American Airlines, which was blocked on antitrust grounds. JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty emphasizes that this collaboration is a bold step forward, bringing together two customer-focused airlines to provide more choices for travelers and value across their networks.</p>

          <p>Three significant wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing full containment after burning for several weeks, prompting evacuations that have since been lifted. Firefighters have made substantial progress against the Jenkins Creek, Camp House Road, and Munger Shaw fires, with the Horse River Fire also being addressed. The Camp House Road Fire reportedly destroyed over 150 structures, while the Jenkins Creek Fire is believed to be human-caused and still under investigation. Relief efforts are underway, with donations being collected to support affected community members in Lake and St. Louis Counties, as residents begin returning to their properties.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a boost following a U.S. court's decision to block President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which were seen as a threat to economic and corporate growth. The ruling, though subject to appeal, was welcomed by investors, leading to a rise in stock futures and indexes across Asia and Europe. While analysts suggest the court's decision reduces uncertainty in the long run, they also caution that challenges to the ruling could cause short-term market volatility. Investors are now closely monitoring court rulings and appeals alongside Trump's trade policies, as the market attempts to plan for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, citing that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The ruling was based on cases brought by small businesses and US state governments, challenging the import taxes. While the White House has criticized the ruling and plans to appeal, state officials and market analysts have welcomed the decision, leading to a rise in stock markets. The court's message is clear: "The Oval Office isn't a trading desk, and the Constitution isn't a blank cheque," according to Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 conference, asserting that the Trump administration does not view stablecoins as a threat to the U.S. dollar, but rather as a force multiplier for economic strength. He highlighted the administration's efforts to pass the GENIUS Act, a bill regulating digital assets like stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value against assets like the U.S. dollar. Vance's message reinforces the Trump-Vance administration's pro-crypto agenda, despite previous concerns about potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. Advisor David Sacks claims a legal framework could create trillions of dollars of demand for US Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this, the company posted financial results for the April quarter that beat market expectations, allaying fears that demand for its graphics processing units, which have become key for training huge AI models, is dwindling. The U.S. has also ordered companies producing chemicals and design software for semiconductors to stop shipping goods to China without a license. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deceptively simple reform that could unlock more housing is single-stair housing, a design that is standard in urban housing throughout Europe, South America, and Asia. The concept of single-stair housing is being introduced to American audiences and is winning even in the face of opponents who warn it‚Äôs unsafe. Allowing single-stair construction for buildings up to six stories offers a practical solution to construction costs and zoning restrictions. Advocates argue that features like sprinklers make the design just as safe and current rules may actually steer people toward less safe housing.</p>

          <p>Stock market investors have discovered a profitable trading strategy based on President Trump's tariff policy, known as the 'TACO trade,' which involves buying stocks after a tariff announcement and selling when Trump inevitably reverses course. Trump's inconsistent tariff policies and quick reversals have created market volatility, allowing savvy investors to profit from the fluctuations. Senator Schiff has expressed concerns that these policy gyrations provide opportunities for insider trading, while analysts emphasize the importance of remaining calm during Trump-inspired market downturns. Despite the potential for short-term gains, the long-term ramifications of Trump's trade war remain uncertain.</p>
