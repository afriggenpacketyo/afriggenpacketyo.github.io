          <p>An excerpt from former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," reveals his reflections on how his upbringing in Sacramento shaped his judicial philosophy. He discusses his journey to the nation's highest court and the immense responsibility that came with being one of only 116 justices in U.S. history. Kennedy emphasizes the importance of respecting economic freedom and personal liberty, principles he believes are essential for the nation's creative energies to flourish. The memoir aims to explain his perspective on honoring the country's founding principles with civility and tolerance.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially commenced in Gaza, initiating a critical 72-hour countdown for the release of all remaining Israeli hostages. The truce is a key component of a U.S.-brokered peace plan aimed at ending the long-standing conflict. According to an Israeli official, Hamas is expected to release the 48 remaining hostages, including 20 believed to be alive, by Monday. The implementation of this first phase, which included an initial withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza, marks a significant step toward de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan political opposition leader, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her persistent efforts to promote democracy in her country. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as a unifying figure who has bravely resisted authoritarian rule, even while living in hiding and facing serious threats. In her acceptance, Machado called for continued support from the United States and other democratic nations to achieve a peaceful transition of power. The award highlights the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela under the autocratic regime of Nicolas Maduro.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru, has promised universal free childcare for children aged nine months to four years if his party wins the next Senedd election. The proposal aims to provide at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031, a policy described as "transformative" for families. Positioning his party as a viable replacement for the long-governing Labour party, ap Iorwerth framed the pledge as a crucial helping hand with cost-of-living pressures. The plan would represent the most generous childcare offer in the UK and would be funded from the existing Welsh government budget.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Rocket Lab is on track for a significant weekly gain, with its stock value increasing by over 20% following a series of new launch contracts. The company recently secured two launches with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and a multi-launch deal with Japanese startup Q-shu Pioneers of Space. This adds to a growing manifest that includes 21 total missions for the Japanese satellite company Synspective.

          <p>A recent surge in the price of Bitcoin has created approximately 70,000 new crypto millionaires over the past year, according to a new study. The report from Henley & Partners indicates there are now over 241,000 individuals with crypto holdings valued at $1 million or more. Research suggests these newly wealthy investors, who are often younger, have a higher propensity to spend their gains compared to those with stock market wealth, potentially adding billions to the economy. While some spending goes toward luxury goods, much of it is directed at real estate, restaurants, and general merchandise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As a ceasefire takes hold in Gaza, Yehuda Cohen, the father of 21-year-old Israeli hostage Nimrod Cohen, is preparing for his son's long-awaited return after two years in Hamas captivity. He expressed cautious optimism as the 72-hour countdown for the hostage release began, part of a U.S.-brokered peace deal. Cohen directed sharp criticism at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of being the "main obstacle" to securing a deal and only agreeing after being pressured by President Trump. He stated that while his family is focused on his son's rehabilitation, holding Netanyahu accountable is crucial for Israel's future security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key provision in U.S. bankruptcy law, often called the "two-year rule," governs how soon a person can receive a second debt discharge after a previous Chapter 13 case. The rule states that a new Chapter 13 filing is only eligible for a discharge if it occurs at least two years after the filing date of the prior case, not the discharge date. Misunderstanding this timing can lead to filing a new case that successfully restructures secured debts but fails to eliminate unsecured debts like credit card balances. This distinction is crucial for borrowers considering a repeat filing to achieve comprehensive debt relief.</p>

          <p>Former manager Steven Gerrard is reportedly in talks with the owners of Rangers FC about a potential return to the Scottish club following the dismissal of Russell Martin. Gerrard, who previously led Rangers to their first top-flight title in a decade during the 2020-21 season, has recently spoken of having "unfinished business" in management. While his subsequent managerial stints at Aston Villa and in Saudi Arabia were less successful, his previous achievement at Ibrox remains significant. The club has stated it is undergoing a rigorous recruitment process, but Gerrard is considered a leading candidate for the position.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children, who had been displaced by the war, have been successfully reunited with their families. This development follows what she described as an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The communication was initiated by a letter from Mrs. Trump, hand-delivered to Putin in August, in which she appealed for the protection of children affected by the conflict. Russia's removal of Ukrainian children has been widely condemned, with the International Criminal Court issuing an arrest warrant for Putin for alleged war crimes related to the abductions.</p>
