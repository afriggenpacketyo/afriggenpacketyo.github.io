          <p>England's rugby team claimed a 2-0 series victory against Argentina with a thrilling 22-17 win in San Juan, sealed by a last-minute try from Jack van Poortvliet. The match was tightly contested, with the score tied at 17-17 for a large portion of the second half. Despite Argentina's improved performance compared to the first Test, England's late-game execution secured their sixth consecutive Test win. The victory marks a successful tour for Steve Borthwick's team, continuing their winning streak from the Six Nations tournament.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence in China is being linked to the country's declining birth rate, as AI begins to fulfill roles traditionally met through family, such as emotional companionship and elderly care. Many young Chinese citizens feel less pressure to marry and have children, believing future technology will support a solitary lifestyle. While this trend is often viewed as exacerbating demographic challenges, some experts argue it may not be entirely bad news, suggesting the AI revolution could redefine societal structures around life and family.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova admitted that nerves and fatigue overwhelmed her during her 6-0, 6-0 loss to Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon final. The 23-year-old, playing in her first Grand Slam final, described herself as being "a bit frozen" by the occasion, resulting in the most one-sided women's final at the tournament in over a century. Despite the demoralizing defeat, Anisimova is taking the match as a learning experience on how to handle pressure at the highest level. She will rise to a career-high ranking of seventh in the world following her impressive tournament run.</p>

          <p>In what was dubbed the "shortest call" in the show's history, finance personality Dave Ramsey gave blunt advice to a 20-year listener named Chad. The caller, a real estate agent, had $211,000 in cash and a remaining mortgage of $95,000, and asked for confirmation on whether to pay it off. Ramsey immediately responded, "Good Lord. Pay it off today," ending the call in under a minute. The interaction exemplifies Ramsey's long-held financial philosophy of eliminating debt as the top priority, even if mathematical models might suggest investing the cash could yield higher returns.

          <p>A dramatic end to the third day of the Test match between England and India was marked by accusations of time-wasting. England opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the final over, ensuring he and his partner would only face one over instead of two before the close of play. India's players reacted angrily, but England's bowling coach pointed out that India's captain Shubman Gill had also caused a lengthy delay for a massage a day earlier. The incident added tension to the tightly contested match at Lord's, with both sides animated by the strategic gamesmanship.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek expressed her own surprise after winning her first Wimbledon title, a victory she described as surreal on what has historically been her weakest surface. The 24-year-old, known as the 'Queen of Clay,' had never won a tour-level title on grass before her dominant 6-0, 6-0 final victory. Swiatek attributed her improved performance to having more time to practice on grass this year and focusing on her movement. Her win marks her sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces.</p>
