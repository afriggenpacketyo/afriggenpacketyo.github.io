          <h2>TikTok Trend: McDonald's 'McMigraine' Remedy Gains Popularity, Doctors Offer Alternative Advice</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral trend on TikTok suggests that a specific McDonald's order, consisting of a large Coca-Cola and large fries, can alleviate migraine symptoms, leading to the moniker 'McMigraine.' Doctors attribute potential relief to caffeine and carbonation in Coca-Cola, which can constrict blood vessels and settle the stomach, respectively, while the sodium and carbohydrates in fries may address electrolyte imbalances and nausea. The article highlights that this remedy is not a cure and may worsen migraines for some individuals, advising hydration and alternatives like matcha or green tea to address dehydration and electrolyte imbalance without unhealthy components.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer advises investors to manage their fears following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to market reactions after similar downgrades in 2011 and 2023. He argues that investors are conditioned to be fearful and that the downgrade prompted excessive selling. Instead of selling, Cramer suggests viewing the downgrade as an early warning to increase savings and invest more cautiously. He recommends gold and bitcoin as potential hedges against government borrowing, while warning investors against succumbing to fear-mongering.</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to understand why the universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan constructing advanced detectors to study neutrinos and antineutrinos. The current theory of the universe's creation cannot explain the presence of planets, stars, and galaxies. These experiments aim to determine if there are differences in how neutrinos and antineutrinos change as they travel, which could explain why matter prevailed over antimatter. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) and the Japanese-led Hyper-K project represent international collaborations pushing the boundaries of physics.</p>
