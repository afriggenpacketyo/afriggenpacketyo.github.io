          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This positive performance stood in contrast to broader market downturns across the Asia-Pacific region. Other major indexes, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225, experienced significant losses due to mounting fears about the U.S. banking sector and persistent trade tensions. The decline in other Asian markets followed a sell-off on Wall Street, highlighting investor anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, known as cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning their policy with Scotland. Administered every two months, this shot provides an alternative to daily oral pills (PrEP), which can be impractical or challenging for some high-risk individuals to take consistently. Health experts and officials have hailed the approval as a 'game-changing' step toward the UK's goal of eliminating new HIV cases by 2030. The new option is expected to improve access and convenience, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call where Trump claims 'great progress was made,' shifting focus back to the European conflict after a ceasefire was achieved in Gaza. To increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a possibility that will be discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This renewed diplomatic push signals a significant effort to resolve the nearly four-year-long conflict.</p>

It frames his arrival within the 'Great White Hope' narrative, a recurring theme in American sports, while noting that Flagg's exceptional athleticism and two-way skills defy old stereotypes. The analysis details the challenges he faces, including joining a team still reeling from the trade of Luka Dončić and playing for a controversial owner. Flagg is expected to be the primary offensive engine for the Mavericks in his first year, carrying the weight of a city's hopes.</p>

          <p>England fast bowler Mark Wood has stated he is 'quietly confident' about being fit for the first Ashes Test match against Australia. The 35-year-old has been sidelined since February due to a knee injury that required surgery in March, causing him to miss the entire summer cricket season. Wood has been participating in a training camp where he reports his recovery is progressing well and his bowling pace is returning to form. He hopes to prove his readiness in upcoming practice games ahead of the series opener in Perth on November 21.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to lift an order preventing the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The three-judge panel determined that the administration was unlikely to prove a 'rebellion' exists in the state, which is a legal requirement for such a federal intervention. The court found insufficient evidence that protests against federal immigration policies have impeded law enforcement or amounted to an insurrection. This decision keeps a temporary restraining order in place, maintaining the state's control over the troops and representing a check on presidential power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, has identified coffee shops and food delivery services as significant new competitors for the traditional pub industry. In an interview, Nick Mackenzie noted that these businesses are capturing a share of consumers' leisure time and money, especially as a growing portion of the population, particularly younger people, do not drink alcohol. To adapt, Greene King is improving its coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, food-led environments to attract a broader customer base. The chain is also exploring 'competitive socialising' activities to remain relevant in a changing market.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is working to establish a direct export route for its fresh durians to China, a move aimed at significantly increasing profits for its growers. Currently, Indonesian durians often transit through neighboring countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which assist with refrigeration and phytosanitary approvals required by Chinese customs. By developing its own certification processes and cold-chain storage infrastructure, Indonesia hopes to bypass these intermediaries and capture a larger share of the lucrative Chinese market. China is the world's largest consumer of the fruit, importing over 90 percent of global production.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This initiative, available to approximately 1.8 million former service members, is designed to make it easier for them to prove their status and access dedicated services like healthcare, housing support, and retail discounts. Ministers also see the launch as a case study to demonstrate the functionality and security of a planned, more comprehensive digital ID scheme for all UK citizens and residents. The veteran card is optional but marks a key step in the government's broader digital identity strategy.</p>
