          <p>A 32-year-old man has been arrested after a train collided with a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Herefordshire, U.K., resulting in injuries to two people and significant disruption to rail services. The British Transport Police are investigating the circumstances leading up to the crash, which involved a farm track crossing used by agricultural vehicles. Passengers on board the train described the experience as frightening, with screaming and shaking, but thankfully, most escaped serious injury. This incident follows a recent investigation into safety system faults on a train involved in a fatal crash last year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from Naval Academy libraries, following a Pentagon review that utilized standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. Only about 20 books now require removal pending further review by a Department of Defense panel. Previously, the Navy used its own search terms, leading to the removal of titles like Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings." The Pentagon memo aimed to align the DOD with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>South Africans have expressed disappointment at Donald Trump's disrespectful treatment of President Cyril Ramaphosa during their meeting in Washington, where Trump repeatedly interrupted Ramaphosa and made unfounded allegations of a "white genocide." Ramaphosa remained calm and diplomatic, challenging Trump's claims and emphasizing that crime affects all South Africans, not just white farmers. The African National Congress praised Ramaphosa's conduct, comparing it to Nelson Mandela's diplomatic tradition. Despite the hostile reception, Ramaphosa's delegation included prominent white South Africans, showcasing the country's diversity and unity.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' chief financial officer stated that some travelers are avoiding Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions, opting for alternatives like LaGuardia, JFK, or Philadelphia. The impact is considered "modest," but reflects ongoing issues with congestion at Newark. The FAA has ordered airlines to temporarily cut flights at Newark to alleviate congestion amid air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has further exacerbated disruptions, affecting travelers' choices and airline operations.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has continued its rally, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The price surge is attributed to easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has highlighted alternative stores of value like bitcoin. Positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers are also contributing factors. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value.</p>

          <p>The UK's former scientific adviser, Lord Patrick Vallance, told the Covid inquiry that Boris Johnson pushed for a more "ruthless, authoritarian approach" towards people who refused to self-isolate during the pandemic. Vallance's diary entries revealed that policy makers favored "punitive measures" over financial support. Johnson reportedly said, "We haven't been ruthless enough. We need to force more isolation. I favour a more authoritarian approach." Ministers eventually introduced fines for those who failed to self-isolate, along with support payments for lower-income individuals.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on the export of fentanyl and precursor chemicals caused a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the U.S., deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25%. Beijing imposed a strict drug control policy in May 2019, adding all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that absent China‚Äôs restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>

          <p>Peru's top court has issued a landmark ruling recognizing the territorial rights of the Kichwa people within a protected area in the Amazon, marking a major breakthrough for Indigenous land claims. The decision affirms that Indigenous stewardship is fully compatible with conservation goals, setting a powerful precedent for rights-based forest protection in Peru. The ruling came after a legal challenge by four Indigenous organizations, who argued that the state denied their ancestral presence for decades, creating protected areas without consultation or consent. Environmentalists say the case could reshape how Peru approaches forest protection.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that children's breakfast cereals have been getting sweeter, fattier, and less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. The study analyzed 1,200 cereals and found that total fat per serving increased by 33.6%, sodium content increased by 32.1%, and sugar content increased by 10.9%. Protein and dietary fiber decreased, raising concerns about the nutritional quality of common breakfast choices for children.

          <p>Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday. The legislation includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities. The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000.</p>
