          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his vision for "personal superintelligence," a form of advanced AI designed to empower individuals by helping them achieve personal and professional goals. He believes this technology, which surpasses human cognition, will usher in an era of personal empowerment rather than just creating abundance. Zuckerberg also highlighted the role of AI-integrated glasses, developed in partnership with Ray-Ban, as the future primary computing devices that will see and hear what users do.

          <p>Meta's stock price increased significantly after the company reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed the strong performance to AI advancements enhancing the efficiency of the company's advertising systems. Meta also issued a third-quarter sales forecast that exceeded Wall Street estimates and announced increased capital expenditures, partly due to a major investment in the AI firm Scale AI. Despite these gains, the Reality Labs division continued to operate at a substantial loss. (not investment advice)</p>

Growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrency, with total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion. The company also saw a 76% increase in subscribers for its premium Robinhood Gold service, signaling strong customer engagement and a positive start to the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

The latest industrial action, the first under the new Labour government, concluded after previous negotiations over working conditions broke down. Streeting stated he is not willing to negotiate further on pay but is open to discussing other issues like career progression and rotas. While expressing that the union had squandered goodwill, he affirmed his door remains open, with the BMA hoping for a more tangible settlement offer this time.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net $2 billion impact from the levies. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations but saw its stock dip in after-hours trading. The new guidance includes adjusted earnings of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, lower than its pre-tariff forecast. CEO Jim Farley noted that while Ford manufactures most of its vehicles in the U.S., it still relies on imported parts, and the company remains in constructive conversations with the Trump administration regarding the tariffs.

The appointment follows the departure of director Johanna Burton, who is leaving to lead the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania. Goldstein has a long history with MOCA, having worked there for over two decades before holding leadership roles at other major institutions. The museum's board has initiated an international search for a permanent director as it navigates another leadership transition, aiming to maintain momentum and stability.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Senate committee has voted to advance legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. In an 8-7 vote, Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to move the bill forward, while all other Republicans voted against it. The bill, now called the Honest Act, would require lawmakers to sell their stocks within 180 days. The move has created friction within the Republican party, and it remains uncertain if the legislation will receive a full vote in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has repatriated an American child from the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, a facility holding tens of thousands of people, mostly women and children with alleged ties to ISIS. The State Department confirmed the child, who has never known life outside the camps, will be reunited with family in the U.S. This action is part of a long-standing U.S. effort to encourage countries to take back their citizens from the sprawling and dangerous camps. The U.S. maintains that repatriation is the only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>Despite poor reviews, the Hollywood Premiere Motel has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, becoming the first motel to receive the honor. The L.A. City Council approved the designation, citing the 1960 building's prime example of mid-century Googie architecture and its weathered neon sign as culturally significant. Preservationists argued the motel is a rare and intact example from the glory days of roadside tourism in Hollywood. While the landmark status does not guarantee protection from demolition, it requires a review process for any proposed alterations to the historic property.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold interest rates steady and Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern about the inflationary potential of tariffs. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.37% following the news. The Fed's decision to maintain its current rate, along with stronger-than-expected second-quarter GDP growth of 3%, reinforced the case for not cutting rates immediately. Powell's comments during his press conference signaled that policymakers are closely watching economic data and have made no firm decisions regarding a potential rate cut in September.

          <p>There is renewed hope for solving the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed, thanks to new DNA technology. For over 30 years, the case has remained unsolved despite initial arrests and convictions that were later overturned. A key piece of evidence, a male DNA profile found on one of the victims, has been the focus of the investigation. Although a promising lead from a public database in 2017 was later ruled out, investigators believe that further advancements in DNA science could eventually identify the person responsible from the limited sample that still exists.</p>
