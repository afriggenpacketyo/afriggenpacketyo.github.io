          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial document that will outline the nation's development priorities and economic direction for the coming half-decade. Historically, these expansive blueprints have driven massive infrastructure projects, such as the 2009 stimulus package, which propelled economic growth but also accumulated local government debt, a persistent challenge. Experts anticipate the upcoming plan will continue significant infrastructure investment, but with a renewed emphasis on tech-driven and people-centric projects to meet evolving societal demands and address past financial pressures more sustainably.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, where a Gaza peace plan will be formally signed, marking a historic turning point. This significant event follows a ceasefire that took effect Friday, resulting from the first phase of a deal brokered by US President Donald Trump between Israel and Hamas. While the initial phase involves Hamas releasing hostages and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased aid to Gaza, crucial later phases concerning the Strip's governance, Israeli troop withdrawal, and Hamas's disarmament still require complex negotiations among international partners.</p>

          <p>While China has advanced with its commercial underwater data center in Hainan, an opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships could thwart its AI leadership plans. The Trump administration's multi-billion dollar deals to supply chips to the UAE, supporting its Stargate UAE AI data center, are highlighted as a significant competitive advantage. The article argues that the US's stronger capital access and the strategic alignment between Nvidia and the Trump administration position it to accelerate data center production more rapidly, potentially hindering China's near-term bid to lead the global data center industry.</p>

US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowds, crediting Donald Trump for brokering the deal, though many attendees expressed anger at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials reported 500,000 people returning to northern Gaza, often finding their homes destroyed, and Egypt confirmed a Monday summit with Trump and over 20 leaders to finalize the peace agreement. Hamas has until Monday to release 48 hostages, while Israel is expected to release Palestinian prisoners, with aid still struggling to enter Gaza.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, is currently receiving radiation therapy as part of his ongoing treatment for prostate cancer, according to his spokesman. Diagnosed in May with an aggressive form that had spread to his bones, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, Biden is also undergoing hormone treatment. Sources indicate the radiation therapy began several weeks ago and is expected to span five weeks in Philadelphia. Biden, who left office as the oldest serving US president, has long advocated for cancer research, particularly after the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer in 2015, and has been treated twice for skin cancer previously.</p>

This standout display has significantly strengthened his case for a starting position in England's Ashes series against Australia, with coach Shaun Wane set to announce his squad soon. Pundits and coaches alike, including Hull KR's Willie Peters, believe Lewis has emphatically proven his big-game credentials and is "shouting from the rooftops" for selection, creating a selection headache for the England boss amidst other strong contenders.</p>
