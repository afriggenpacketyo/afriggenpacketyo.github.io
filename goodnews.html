          <p>The BBC has introduced an interactive feature titled "Cooler Than Me?" which allows users to compare their local weather forecasts with cities worldwide. This playful tool taps into Britain's national pastime of discussing the weather, offering a unique way for individuals to explore global climate patterns. It aims to provide engaging insights into meteorological data, potentially sparking interest in becoming a 'star meteorologist' for the BBC.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points. Key indices like the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB are all projected to see gains. While the Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the cut as 'risk management,' dampening hopes for a lengthy cutting path, global traders are assessing the implications. The Bank of England is also set to announce its interest rate decision soon.</p>

          <p>Blake Snell pitched a masterful seven scoreless innings, striking out 12 batters, to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Despite recent struggles from the bullpen, Snell's efficient and aggressive approach made their job easy, allowing the Dodgers to build an early lead with a Freddie Freeman home run and other key hits. Manager Dave Roberts initially approached the mound in the seventh, but Snell convinced him to stay in, sealing his best performance in a Dodgers uniform and drawing a raucous ovation. The win helps the Dodgers maintain their lead in the National League West.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters predict it will remain over open waters for several days but could intensify into a low-grade hurricane by the weekend. Its current forecast track shows it moving north of the Caribbean, potentially reaching Bermuda next week. While no immediate land hazards are warned, the storm's path and strength remain uncertain as it continues to develop.</p>

          <p>Huawei has announced a significant AI computing breakthrough, developing what it calls the "world's most powerful" supernode computing cluster using local chipmaking processes. This development aims to boost China's self-reliance in AI computing, circumventing U.S. export restrictions that have targeted companies like Nvidia. Huawei also plans to launch upgraded Ascend AI chips over the next three years, aligning with the release schedules of major global competitors. This move highlights the ongoing tech competition and China's strategic efforts to reduce dependence on foreign technology.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic, breaking an unusual nearly three-week drought of named storms during the peak of hurricane season. The storm, with sustained winds of 50 mph, is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday as it moves northwest. While direct impacts on the U.S. are not anticipated, high surf and dangerous rip currents are forecast for the eastern Caribbean islands. This season has seen fewer storms than predicted, largely due to dry, stable air and strong wind shear in the tropical Atlantic.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, former Vice President Kamala Harris revealed that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for a running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

Harris expressed her admiration for working with Buttigieg and their friendship, acknowledging their mutual sadness over the political calculation.

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a fresh record high, leading gains in real estate and technology sectors, while other Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cut. The Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, with Chair Jerome Powell framing it as a 'risk management cut.' The Bank of Japan is also holding a policy meeting, with expectations of steady rates but a potential hike later in the year. Asian chip stocks, including SK Hynix and TSMC, saw increases after reports of China banning Nvidia AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's initial interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank (PBOC) will implement only moderate easing, despite having more room for action. The PBOC set the yuan's midpoint rate lower, reflecting market reactions to the Fed's 25 basis point reduction. Experts predict a smaller rate cut pace from the PBOC compared to the Fed, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and alleviate capital outflow pressures on the yuan, thereby supporting its value.

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, is now scheduled to rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS) after resolving two premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed that an early warning system triggered the shutdowns due to conservative software settings, an issue that has since been fixed. Astronaut Jonny Kim, supported by Zena Cardman, will capture the upgraded Cygnus XL using the station's robotic arm. This mission is a crucial resupply effort, especially after an earlier Cygnus vehicle was damaged during transit.</p>
