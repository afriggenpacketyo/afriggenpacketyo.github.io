        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory against Sam Houston State. Manning threw for 309 yards and three touchdowns, and also scored two rushing touchdowns, showing a level of "swagger" his teammates and coaches noted was missing in previous weeks. After one touchdown run, he engaged in a brief verbal exchange with a defender, a move he later admitted his mother was "pretty mad about" but attributed to built-up frustration. The performance marks a positive turn for the highly-touted quarterback and the Longhorns team.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executives Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely to be involved in the investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a recent interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other key figures in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The potential sale of the popular social media app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, follows a congressional mandate over national security concerns. The White House is reportedly finalizing a deal where a U.S.-majority board would control the company and its algorithm.</p>

          <p>A section of London's bustling Oxford Street was closed to traffic for a day as part of a trial for a potential permanent pedestrianization plan. Mayor Sadiq Khan, who visited the event, hailed it as "the day the fight back began to rescue this street," envisioning a future where the area is a safer and more attractive destination for shopping and leisure. The proposal aims to ban vehicles from the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. However, the plan has faced criticism over concerns about traffic congestion on side streets and reduced accessibility for people with mobility issues.</p>

          <p>The Big Cat Project has shared remarkable footage showing the intense and ferocious behavior of two Amur tigers as they were released back into the wild in Russia. The video shows the massive sibling tigers, the largest of the tiger subspecies, snarling and aggressively swatting at their cage doors just before being freed. The animals had been rehabilitated by the Amur Tiger Center. Conservation groups used the release to highlight the precarious situation of the species, with only 500 to 600 estimated to remain in the wild due to poaching and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>U.S. athlete Cole Hocker won the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Athletics Championships with a stunning finishing kick. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but surged past his competitors to claim the gold medal in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory provided a sense of vindication for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the competition for "jostling." He stated that he "felt like I was robbed" in the earlier race and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage Black due to a controversial decision to pay its players. Each member of the American team will receive $500,000, while the European players continue to compete for free. Donald theorized that if the paid U.S. players underperform, the New York audience, facing high ticket prices, might turn on them.

          <p>To avoid the production quality issues that have plagued other aircraft manufacturers, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet has been designed as a futuristic "smart factory." The system integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker, creating a unified intelligent loop for sensing, communication, and control. This advanced manufacturing approach aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft, which typically rely on manual checks. The C919 is China's first domestically developed large passenger aircraft, representing a major step in the country's aerospace ambitions.</p>

          <p>Passenger rail travel is currently experiencing a significant boom in the United States, with Amtrak leading a notable resurgence.

This renewed interest in train travel reflects a broader shift in transportation preferences, as Americans increasingly seek alternatives to driving and flying for inter-city journeys.</p>

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers participated in an organized event in the Chicago River, a waterway once infamous for its severe pollution. The swim marks a major milestone in the decades-long effort to clean up the river, which was historically used as a dumping ground for industrial and sewage waste. Thanks to the Clean Water Act and local conservation efforts, the river's health has dramatically improved, allowing for the return of fish and wildlife, and now, human recreation. The event symbolizes a changed relationship between the city and its river, transforming it from a toxic channel to a valued public asset.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, U.S. stocks have surged to new record highs, and some market strategists believe the rally has further to go. Optimism is being fueled by easier financial conditions and the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence technology. Analysts at Bank of America noted that while valuations are high, historical bubbles have seen larger gains, suggesting the current trend may not be over. Other strategists argue that AI-driven productivity gains justify higher stock prices, though some caution that further rapid gains could create a speculative "melt-up" that ends in a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this degradation. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage can be mitigated through daily practices aimed at restoring cellular health. She recommends simple lifestyle adjustments such as eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short meditative breaks, increasing Omega-3 intake, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to combat the effects of stress.</p>
