          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved a minority stake sale in the Chicago Bears that values the franchise at a record-breaking $8.9 billion. The deal involves the sale of a 2.35% stake held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna to the team's existing majority owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation significantly surpasses the team's estimated worth of $6.4 billion from the previous year and sets a new benchmark for minority stake sales in the league. The team is currently exploring options for a new stadium to replace Soldier Field. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A generic drug named leucovorin, typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects, is showing promise as a treatment for some children with autism. The drug, a derivative of folic acid, is believed to bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues. Some parents report significant improvements in their children's speech after starting the off-label treatment. While the FDA is beginning the approval process for this use, researchers emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and determine proper dosage.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to companies in Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, which are at risk after JLR halted production due to a cyberattack. The production suspension, which will last until at least next month, threatens the viability of smaller suppliers heavily reliant on JLR's business. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans and a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms. A parliamentary committee is set to hear from affected businesses to inform the government's decision.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Global Governance Initiative Aims to Address International System Deficits</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Global Governance Initiative is a response to critical deficits in the current international system. The author contends that global governance mechanisms suffer from underrepresentation of the Global South, eroding authority due to unilateral actions that violate international law, and a lack of effectiveness in addressing pressing issues like climate change and sustainable development. According to the article, China seeks to redress these imbalances by promoting a more equitable and effective framework for international cooperation, countering what it views as a persistent Cold War mentality and hegemonism.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial for a one-time gene therapy treatment, AMT-130, has shown a 75% reduction in the progression of Huntington's disease over three years in patients receiving a high dose. Huntington's is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a faulty gene that damages brain cells, and current treatments only manage symptoms. This experimental therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions to the brain that turn off the harmful protein. While the results are highly promising, the treatment requires complex brain surgery and is still years away from potential FDA approval.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen and "tough it out" with fevers, medical professionals are pushing back, emphasizing the potential dangers of his advice. Doctors and public health officials warn that untreated high fevers during pregnancy are linked to developmental issues in babies, making fever reduction crucial. They reiterate that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, remains the safest over-the-counter option for managing pain and fever during pregnancy. Experts worry the president's comments could lead to harmful health outcomes for both mothers and their children.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas nearly doubled after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal emerged during renegotiations of a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As U.S. consumer debt reaches new highs, financial experts are highlighting common pitfalls that can sabotage repayment efforts. Key mistakes to avoid include only making minimum payments, which barely reduces the principal balance and maximizes interest costs over time. Other detrimental habits are accumulating new debt while paying off old balances, failing to seek professional help from credit counselors, and draining emergency savings for debt payments. Experts stress that changing the underlying spending habits that led to the debt is just as crucial as making consistent payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the fall respiratory illness season begins, parents are facing confusing and conflicting recommendations regarding COVID-19 and flu vaccinations for children. While medical groups like the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are aligned in recommending the annual flu shot for everyone 6 months and older, their advice on the COVID-19 vaccine now differs. The CDC suggests parents of healthy children "may receive" the shot after discussion with a doctor, whereas the AAP strongly recommends it for young children. This divergence is causing uncertainty for families seeking to protect their children from illness.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is praised as a fun and fizzy adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland." The movie follows a fictional revolutionary group across 16 years, starring Teyana Taylor as a potent and volatile leader and Leonardo DiCaprio as her comically inept follower. The review highlights standout performances, including Sean Penn as a repellent and obsessive colonel. The film reorients the source material around race and modern political tensions, creating a thrilling and galvanizing experience that trusts the audience to understand its message without explicit exposition.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is escalating its war strategy by focusing on long-range drone and missile strikes against Russia's economic infrastructure, particularly its oil and gas industry. Having rapidly developed its domestic weapons production, Ukraine is now capable of hitting targets deep inside Russia, aiming to disrupt the revenue funding the Russian military. This campaign, which has already damaged numerous refineries and reduced Russia's oil exports, is seen by some Ukrainian officials as a form of self-imposed sanctions that could be decisive in ending the war. This approach is being pursued as Ukraine seeks to create leverage independently of fluctuating international support.</p>
