          <p>Procter & Gamble announced fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming product lines. Despite the positive results, the company noted that overall sales volume was flat, indicating that inflation-weary consumers are stretching their budgets and reducing purchasing frequency. P&G's CFO Andre Schulten described the consumer environment as stable but not great, observing a split where higher-income shoppers buy in bulk while others use products to the last drop before repurchasing. The company maintained its sales and earnings forecast for the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The concept of the "alien," from extraterrestrials in science fiction to artificial intelligence, often reflects shifting societal anxieties and the human tendency to define an "other." This article traces the evolution of alien imagery in pop culture, from the Cold War-era paranoia of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" to the introspective themes in modern films like "Arrival." It also draws parallels between the term's use in immigration debates and the rise of AI, which some experts describe as an "alien intelligence" of our own creation. Ultimately, our depiction of aliens often reveals more about our own fears and understanding of the unknown than about potential otherworldly life.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, published an editorial stating that fighting corruption and ensuring political loyalty are essential for the People's Liberation Army to win wars. This declaration follows a recent Communist Party conclave that endorsed the continuation of the military's anti-corruption campaign. The article stresses that the army must remain free of corrupt elements and adhere to strict political guidance. It also calls for accelerating the development of advanced combat capabilities and modernizing military governance to enhance overall war-readiness and effectiveness.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool Manager Arne Slot Expresses No Concern Over Mohamed Salah's Goal-Scoring Form</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 07:59:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has dismissed concerns about winger Mohamed Salah's recent dip in goal-scoring, stating it is "the last thing" he worries about. Salah, who was the team's top scorer last season with 29 goals, has only scored three league goals this term amid the team's broader struggles. Slot attributes the slow start to the integration of new players and the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, which has altered team dynamics. Despite a seven-game streak without a non-penalty goal in the Premier League, the manager remains confident that the prolific Egyptian forward will soon return to his usual goal-scoring form.</p>

          <p>An audacious daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves stole jewels valued at approximately $102 million, is being framed not just as a crime but as a thrilling public spectacle. The perpetrators escaped on mopeds after accessing the Apollo Gallery via an unmonitored balcony, leaving behind tools and evidence in their hasty retreat. This article suggests the crime is a gift to the world's imagination, evoking classic heist narratives and reminding people of the potential for adventure. The theft has also ironically made the stolen items, once relatively obscure, world-famous, much like the Mona Lisa after its own theft in 1911.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a new report from Hedge Fund Research. This growth was driven by a significant influx of new capital in the third quarter, which saw the largest net asset inflow in 18 years, combined with strong investment returns. The industry's assets grew by $238.4 billion in the quarter, with investors allocating $33.7 billion in net new capital. Analysts attribute the historic growth to factors like rising M&A activity, successful technology investments, and expectations of lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. This article provides an overview of current average CD rates for various terms, noting that top offers, particularly from online banks, are significantly higher than national averages. For example, while the average 1-year CD yield is 1.97% APY, some banks offer rates above 4.25%. To get the best rates, savers are advised to look at online banks, consider short-term CDs which currently have higher yields, and potentially use a laddering strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, understanding current interest rates is crucial in a challenging market. As of October 23, 2025, the national average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.34%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.71%.

          <p>Plaid Cymru has secured a significant victory in the Caerphilly by-election, a seat historically held by the Labour Party for over a century. The result is a major success for Plaid Cymru, which successfully positioned itself as the primary alternative to both the incumbent Welsh Labour government and the rising Reform UK party, which finished second. For Labour, the third-place finish is a deeply troubling sign ahead of the full Senedd election, reflecting widespread voter dissatisfaction. The outcome suggests a shifting political landscape in Wales, with Plaid Cymru gaining momentum by focusing on practical issues over Welsh independence.</p>
