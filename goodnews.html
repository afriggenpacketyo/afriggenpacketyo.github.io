          <p>The Dalai Lama, Tibet's 90-year-old spiritual leader, has indicated that the tradition of his reincarnation could continue after his death, a shift from previous statements where he suggested he might be the last. Speaking ahead of his birthday, he mentioned a framework for discussing the institution's continuation, emphasizing the decision ultimately rests with the Tibetan people. This comes amidst ongoing political tensions with China, which views him as a separatist and may attempt to name its own successor. He reassured followers of his good health and commitment to his work while in exile in India.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu has made a significant move into the open-source AI community by releasing ten variants of its flagship Ernie 4.5 models on the Hugging Face platform. This marks a strategic U-turn for the company, which previously positioned its proprietary models as superior to open-source alternatives. The models range from lightweight versions to a powerful 424 billion parameter model, with Baidu claiming its 300B model outperforms a key competitor. This shift reflects the intensifying competition in China's AI landscape and a strategic pivot to foster broader development and adoption of its technology.</p>

          <p>Google has made its first commercial commitment to fusion energy, announcing a partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a company spun off from MIT. The tech giant plans to purchase 200 megawatts of clean power from CFS's forthcoming grid-scale fusion plant, ARC, which is expected to be operational in the early 2030s. This agreement is a significant bet on the future of fusion, a process that aims to generate zero-carbon electricity by replicating the reactions that power the sun. The deal, which includes an increased investment stake in CFS, underscores a growing corporate interest in developing transformative clean energy solutions.</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in years and signaling a potential stabilization in Europe's largest economy. This development could support another ECB interest rate cut later this year, as the disinflationary trend appears to be taking hold across the eurozone. However, economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile external factors, such as energy prices and geopolitical events, could still disrupt this progress. The data provides a moment of relief but underscores the ongoing fragility of the economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

While the UK government hails the deal for saving key sectors hundreds of millions, the lack of resolution on steel tariffs creates significant uncertainty and frustration for British producers, who face making difficult decisions about shipping and production.

The strategy highlights the immense respect opposing pitchers have for Wood's power, as he already has 22 home runs this season. Despite the walks, Wood managed a hit and a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings, showcasing his impact even when denied a chance to swing.</p>

          <p>Greg Grandin's new book, "America, Am√©rica," offers a timely re-examination of hemispheric history, suggesting the U.S. could learn from Latin America's democratic traditions. The article reviews how, contrary to U.S. condescension, many Latin American independence movements and constitutions were founded on collective social ideals, such as abolishing slavery and guaranteeing social rights like healthcare and education. While acknowledging the region's political turmoil, often fueled by U.S. intervention, the book argues that Latin America's historical focus on "the common good" provides a powerful model for strengthening democracy in an era of rising authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The article explores several buildings, like Liverpool's "Paddy's Wigwam" cathedral and London's Southbank Centre, that were initially criticized as ugly but have since earned public affection and protected status. These structures, often from the post-war, modernist, or brutalist eras, were once derided for their unconventional designs or stark materials. However, over time, public opinion has shifted, and many now appreciate their unique character, historical significance, and the bold ambition they represent. This evolution in taste demonstrates how perceptions of architectural beauty can change, turning once-maligned landmarks into cherished parts of a city's identity.</p>
