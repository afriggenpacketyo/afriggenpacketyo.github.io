          <p>As President Trump's tax agenda moves forward, key issues and potential roadblocks are emerging, particularly within the House Ways and Means Committee. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through reconciliation, but the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for a fiscally responsible package could complicate the process. Negotiations are ongoing, with debates focusing on specific provisions and their impact on millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee will debate and advance this legislation on Tuesday.</p>
