          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he noted mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that a comprehensive medical evaluation, including vascular studies, confirmed the benign and common condition, which affects blood flow in the veins. The evaluation ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function. Leavitt also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use for cardiovascular prevention, asserting that the president remains in excellent overall health and feels no discomfort from the condition.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other board members have settled a shareholder lawsuit related to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, just one day after a trial began. The class-action lawsuit, which sought $8 billion, accused company leaders of failing to disclose the risks of user data being misused, allegedly violating a 2012 FTC consent order. The settlement terms were not disclosed, but the agreement resolves personal liability claims against Zuckerberg and other directors, not Meta Platforms as a company. This conclusion averts a lengthy trial and further public testimony from key figures like board member Marc Andreessen.</p>

          <h2>NBCUniversal to Pay $3.6 Million Settlement Over Deceptive Peacock Subscription Practices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:58:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve allegations that its Peacock streaming service used deceptive auto-renewal and cancellation practices. The legal action stemmed from a 2022 consumer complaint, leading to an investigation that found Peacock's policies violated California and federal consumer protection laws. The settlement includes $2 million in civil penalties and $1.6 million for consumer protection enforcement and investigation costs. As part of the deal, Peacock must make its auto-renewal terms clearer, obtain affirmative consent from customers, and provide an easy, immediate method for subscribers to cancel their service.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville is recalling over 67,000 cases of its Power Stick roll-on deodorants due to manufacturing defects. The recall, posted by the FDA, affects three specific products: Power Stick for Her Powder Fresh, Power Stick Invisible Protection Spring Fresh, and Power Stick Original Nourishing. The issue is cited as deviations from "current good manufacturing practices," a set of guidelines for pharmaceutical production, though the exact nature of the defects was not specified. The recalled products were distributed nationally, and consumers are advised to check the lot numbers and UPC codes to see if their items are affected.</p>

          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Suggests Potential Changes to TSA Liquid Restrictions on Flights</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:56:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning the current 3.4-ounce limit and that a change could be the "next big announcement." This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. The potential policy shift is enabled by the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially allowing for more convenient travel procedures.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued new guidance advising that children under the age of seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks. The warning is due to the presence of glycerol, a sugar substitute used to create the slushy texture, which can cause adverse health effects in young children, including headaches, sickness, and in rare cases, shock. The updated advice, which is stricter than previous recommendations, also suggests that children aged seven to ten should limit their intake to one small slushy per day. The FSA is urging vendors to use minimal amounts of glycerol and to display written warnings at the point of sale.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning drug, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount off the list price. This direct-to-consumer model, operating through their Eliquis 360 support program, allows the companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who typically receive substantial rebates. Analysts believe this move will not negatively impact the companies' net pricing and could generate goodwill with the Trump administration amid concerns over drug costs. Eliquis is one of Bristol Myers' top-selling drugs but is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. within a few years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who attempted to shut down a plane's engines mid-flight in 2023, has spoken out about the incident, attributing his actions to a dissociative state induced by psychedelic mushrooms. Emerson, who was grieving a friend's death, described the moment as a panic-fueled attempt to "wake up" from what he perceived as a dream. The case has intensified calls for reforming how the aviation industry addresses pilot mental health, as fear of losing certification often prevents pilots from seeking help. In response, Congress is considering the bipartisan Mental Health in Aviation Act to destigmatize and improve access to care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has voided the 2017 wire fraud conviction of Mark Johnson, a former HSBC executive who was found guilty of front-running a $3.5 billion currency trade. Johnson, who served two years in prison, was accused of using confidential client information to make a profit for the bank. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that his conviction was based on a legal theory of fraud that the Supreme Court later invalidated in an unrelated case. The court expressed "grave doubt" that Johnson could have been convicted under an alternative theory, leading to the reversal and a significant legal victory for the former banker.</p>
