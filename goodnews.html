          <p>Sumo's newest yokozuna, Onosato, has declared his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament in his debut at the sport's highest rank. This feat has only been accomplished by five of the last thirty wrestlers promoted to grand champion. The 25-year-old hopes his success will energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year. His rapid rise after just 13 tournaments has made him a major star, and he is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, Kisenosato, in 2017.</p>

          <p>In a unique family rivalry, Ryder Cup veteran Ian Poulter and his 21-year-old son Luke will compete in the same final qualifying tournament for a coveted spot in The Open at Royal Portrush.

The high-stakes, 36-hole event forces members of the LIV tour, like Poulter and Graeme McDowell, to fly in from Dallas to compete.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has withdrawn its plan to impose a digital services tax on technology firms, paving the way for the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. The tax would have applied a 3% levy on Canadian revenue for companies like Google and Amazon, retroactive to the tune of $2 billion. Prime Minister Mark Carney's retreat is seen as a victory for the White House, allowing tense negotiations over broader tariffs to continue.</p>

          <p>Japan's industrial output rose by 0.5% in May compared to the previous month, marking the first increase in two months, according to preliminary government data. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported that the growth was partly driven by strong performance in the production of machinery and metal molds used in vehicle manufacturing. The seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8 against the 2020 baseline of 100. This follows a revised 1.1% decrease in industrial output recorded in April.

Wadephul emphasized that Germany, as Ukraine's second-largest backer, will continue to provide modern air defense systems, weapons, and economic aid. The visit comes at a critical time as European allies work to compensate for a support gap left by the U.S. administration, which has not announced new aid for Kyiv since early January, highlighting Germany's crucial role in sustaining Ukraine's defense efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a blanket ban imposed in 2023. The original prohibition was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. According to a customs notice, the measure allows for the import of aquatic products from all areas of Japan except for ten prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and surrounding regions. This move signals a potential, albeit limited, de-escalation in the diplomatic and trade tensions between the two countries over the issue.</p>

          <p>A bilateral trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom has officially commenced, reducing tariffs on British cars exported to the US from 27.5% to 10%. Automakers like Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover expect to see a surge in shipments, but the deal is capped at a quota of 100,000 vehicles per year. However, British farmers have criticized the agreement, arguing their sector was used as a bargaining chip, citing the removal of tariffs on US ethanol and new quotas on beef imports. Negotiations to remove a 25% US tariff on British steel remain unresolved.</p>
