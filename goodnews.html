        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent US-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has been welcomed, but experts caution it's not a long-term solution due to deep-seated distrust. While the US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran played crucial mediating roles, analysts from both countries highlight the need for addressing underlying issues like terrorism and water security. The article emphasizes that the ceasefire's sustainability hinges on both nations' commitment to preventing violations and resolving complex civil-military dynamics, particularly in Pakistan. Despite the fragility of the agreement, it represents a crucial step towards stabilizing the region, though lasting peace requires addressing fundamental challenges and fostering mutual trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration policies, including English language tests for spouses and restrictions on care home recruitment from abroad. This move is seen as a response to pressure from Reform UK and aims to regain control of the narrative on immigration. The new rules prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes, work in public sectors, or volunteer, while ending automatic settlement after five years. The Labour party is also announcing its own crackdown on foreign criminals being granted asylum, while critics question the effectiveness and measurement of the government's plans.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reported substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with both sides describing the discussions as productive and constructive. While details are scarce, a joint statement is expected to reveal potential tariff cuts and the establishment of an economic consultation mechanism. The talks, the first since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have sparked optimism in financial markets, with stocks and the yuan showing gains. However, some experts remain cautious, suggesting that the agreement may primarily focus on maintaining communication rather than immediate tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, praised for its affordability and support for long lifespans, faces serious strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population.
