          <p>Loretta Swit, known for her role as Major Margaret Houlihan in the TV series 'M.A.S.H.,' has died at 87 from likely natural causes at her home in New York City. Swit won two Emmy Awards for her portrayal of the demanding head nurse during the Korean War, becoming a beloved figure in television history. She and Alan Alda were the longest-serving cast members on the show, which ran for 11 years and explored issues like PTSD, sexism, and racism. Swit's influence led to a more nuanced and realistic depiction of women on television, moving away from the one-dimensional character in the original film. The series finale of 'M.A.S.H.' remains one of the most-watched episodes in television history, and Swit continued to be recognized for her contributions to the show and her advocacy for animal welfare after its conclusion.</p>

          <p>PBS and Lakeland PBS, a Minnesota affiliate, are suing the Trump administration over an executive order that seeks to defund the network. The lawsuit alleges that the order exceeds presidential authority and violates free speech protections, arguing that the cuts are motivated by disapproval of PBS's news coverage and programming. The legal action follows a similar suit filed by NPR and other public radio stations, contending that the executive order infringes on editorial independence. Lakeland PBS, which relies heavily on federal grants, argues that the funding cuts pose an existential threat to its ability to provide local television programming in Northern and central Minnesota.</p>
