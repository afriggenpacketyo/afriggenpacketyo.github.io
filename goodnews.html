          <h2>Chinese Academics Advocate Rethinking WWII History with Focus on 1931 Invasion</h2>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting that the conflict's start date should be moved back to Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. These academics argue that marking 1939 as the beginning of the war diminishes China's role in the conflict. The discussion coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, as Chinese President Xi Jinping prepares to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain that aims to increase market access for American farm exports, marking the first deal after a wave of steep tariffs. In return, the U.S. will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement, which leaves in place a 10% baseline tariff, is expected to create a $5 billion opportunity for new exports by American farmers and signals a potential approach for trade negotiations with other partners, emphasizing reciprocity and fairness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on specific imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a potential shift away from its protectionist trade policies. The proposed deal comes after President Trump referred to India as the "tariff king" and imposed tariffs on Indian exports. Experts suggest that while India aims to bolster its domestic manufacturing, a trade agreement with the U.S. is essential for economic growth and attracting foreign investment. However, concerns remain regarding the potential impact on domestic businesses and the need to balance trade liberalization with safeguarding local industries.</p>

          <p>A chainsaw-wielding vandal was arrested for cutting down 13 trees in downtown Los Angeles, following a week-long crime spree that initially went unnoticed. The suspect, Samuel Patrick Groft, was apprehended after public outrage and tips, including surveillance footage, helped police piece together the case. Groft, found in possession of an electric chainsaw, has pleaded not guilty to felony vandalism charges, with city officials estimating the damage at over $170,000. While the motive remains unclear, the arrest brought relief to the community after the disturbing acts of vandalism.</p>

Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues the rule "screams sexism" and urges the association to change it. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% want the choice to wear shorts.

However, the indie scene eventually declined, leading to a period of exhaustion and smaller venues for the bands. Now, both The Kooks and Hard-Fi are experiencing a revival, with their music finding new audiences on TikTok and selling out reunion gigs.</p>
