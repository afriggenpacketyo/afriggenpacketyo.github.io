          <p>Pattern Group, a prominent third-party seller on Amazon's marketplace, saw its stock rise 11% in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq. The company, which describes itself as an "ecommerce accelerator" for over 200 brands, raised $300 million through its initial public offering, valuing it at roughly $2.5 billion. The successful debut comes amid a revitalized market for tech IPOs, though the company noted significant risks in its prospectus. These include its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform and uncertainties surrounding international trade policies and potential tariffs from the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research indicates that U.S. electricity demand is set to grow significantly, largely driven by the power requirements of new AI data centers. The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates, creating a favorable market for electrical and power-leveraged industrial companies. This trend is seen as particularly beneficial for firms like Eaton, which produces electrical grid equipment, and GE Vernova, a major manufacturer of power-generating gas turbines. Strong demand and limited production capacity are expected to maintain favorable pricing dynamics for these companies. (not investment advice)</p>

French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the restored towers, fulfilling his promise to complete the primary reconstruction within five years. Visitors can now climb the 424 stairs to experience panoramic views of the city and see the famous gargoyles up close. The cathedral itself reopened in December 2024 and has since attracted nearly 30,000 visitors daily, with the total restoration cost approaching $1 billion, funded by private donations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" plan, providing key details on how the new deduction will work. The provision, enacted in July, allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028. The new guidance clarifies which occupations qualify, notably excluding workers in "specified service trades or businesses" like healthcare and legal services. Officials also confirmed that mandatory or automatic gratuities will not be considered qualified tips, as the payment must be given voluntarily by the customer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several cost-effective options for borrowing money in the current economic climate. A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is among the cheapest, with average rates around 8.05% and the potential to become more affordable with future rate cuts. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans provide an unsecured option that is still significantly cheaper than high-interest credit cards. While borrowing costs remain higher than in recent years, the downward trend in interest rates presents opportunities for consumers seeking financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to attract liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers back to the crucial waterway after severe drought conditions caused a significant decline in traffic. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers next year and are developing a new pipeline project, the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This would free up canal slots for other vessels and provide an alternative transit method for energy products. These initiatives aim to reverse the trend of LNG shipments being diverted to longer routes, such as around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, which would place its valuation at an immense $200 billion. This fundraising effort reflects the soaring valuations across the AI industry, with competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI also securing massive investments. Musk, who later denied the report, has ambitious plans for the company, including the purchase of one million AI chips to build out the necessary computing infrastructure. The company's Grok chatbot has faced controversy, but the potential new capital would significantly fund its development and talent acquisition efforts.</p>

          <p>Following his recent state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump is planning to extend an invitation to King Charles and Queen Camilla for a visit to the United States next year. A senior White House official confirmed the plan, which would coincide with the 250th anniversary of the U.S. The last official state visit by a reigning British monarch was in 2007 by the late Queen Elizabeth II. President Trump has often expressed admiration for the British monarchy, and the planned invitation is seen as a gesture to further strengthen the "special relationship" between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a review of their recent concert at the Forum in Los Angeles, Nine Inch Nails is praised for its potent and timely performance that channels contemporary feelings of rage, disgust, and dread. The band, led by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, delivered a powerful set that included a particularly resonant cover of David Bowie's "I'm Afraid of Americans." The show highlighted the duo's dual strengths: their acclaimed work as film composers and their ability to unleash a raw, aggressive rock performance. The concert served as a reminder of the band's lasting ability to capture and reflect the anxieties of the current social and political climate.</p>
