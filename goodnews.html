          <p>As President Trump engages in talks in Saudi Arabia, China's increasing economic and political involvement in the Middle East is becoming a focal point, with new trade and investment agreements expected to be the primary focus. Washington is aiming to counter China's expanding economic presence, particularly regarding the internationalization of the yuan, with analysts suggesting that China's leverage could help stabilize the region, specifically in relation to Iran. One potential point of contention is the use of the yuan in Gulf trade and China's currency swap agreements, which Washington may pressure Gulf countries to reduce.</p>

          <p>Despite Austria's federal government deprioritizing climate action, Vienna is taking significant steps to combat climate change, including mandating solar panels on new buildings, utilizing geothermal energy to heat homes, and investing in infrastructure to adapt to extreme weather. The city recently passed a climate law aiming to achieve zero climate pollution by 2040, emphasizing accountability by requiring projects to detail both financial and emissions costs. Vienna's commitment provides a model for cities globally, though some of its actions may not be directly replicable in all contexts, such as the U.S., due to differences in utility ownership.</p>

          <p>London police have arrested a 21-year-old suspect in connection with a series of arson attacks, including a fire at a house formerly owned by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Counter-terrorism officials are leading the investigation as a precaution due to the property's previous connection with a high-profile public figure, and the incident raises concerns about the safety of British lawmakers following past attacks.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report will provide an initial assessment of the effects of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on U.S. pricing, with economists anticipating a slight cooldown in inflation despite initial fears of a price surge. Trump has since eased tariffs, including a temporary reduction on Chinese goods, which is expected to lessen the impact on household costs, although a range of levies remain in place. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, with the Fed maintaining interest rates as policymakers await the full impact of the tariff policies.</p>

The move to open registrations follows a $75 million funding round led by Benchmark Capital, although the U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly reviewing the investment, and Manus is providing users with initial credits to try the service.</p>

These talks stood in contrast to previous negotiations led by former vice-premier Liu He, which were often tense, volatile, and marked by distrust, and during the recent meeting, Chinese Vice-Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang made his debut as a trade representative.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.'s temporary reduction of tariffs on China, businesses are scrambling to expedite shipments, with the lower import taxes set to last for only 90 days, creating uncertainty for importers. The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will decrease from 145% to 30%, while China's tariff on U.S. goods will drop from 125% to 10%, although some businesses may rush to produce and ship goods early for the holiday season to avoid potential higher tariffs later. Despite the disruption, many business owners view the temporary deal as better than the previous situation, and are exploring alternative manufacturing locations outside of China.</p>

          <p>Fintech firms, which initially benefited from interest rate hikes, now face a resilience test as interest rates decline, with higher rates boosting net interest income for companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo in 2024. As interest rates fall, doubts arise about the sustainability of relying on this income, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in fintech business models, and some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce reliance on card fees and interest. Companies like Revolut are adding services such as crypto and share trading, and income diversification is seen as key to weathering economic changes.</p>
