          <p>Tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ individuals and supporters participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban under a controversial "child protection" law. Prime Minister Viktor Orb치n's government had threatened participants with fines and organizers with jail time, but the event proceeded with significant turnout and international support. The march has become a symbol of resistance against what critics describe as the erosion of civil liberties and democratic rights in Hungary under Orb치n's leadership. The event highlighted the deep divisions within the country over LGBTQ+ rights and government authority.</p>

          <p>A young woman whose mother fraudulently accumulated $186,000 in credit-card debt under her name sought advice after having her credit history wiped clean, leaving her unable to secure any credit. Hosts of "The Ramsey Show" advised her to embrace a "paradigm shift" away from relying on a credit score, which primarily serves to accumulate more debt. They recommended living debt-free, saving cash for major purchases like a car, and potentially taking on a side job to increase her income. The hosts emphasized that a lack of credit can be a "blessing" preventing future debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The operation involved smuggling 117 drones into Russia and launching them from close range, demonstrating a new, cost-effective way to neutralize assets in supposedly safe rear areas. This attack challenges the conventional military doctrine of depth, proving that smaller nations can counter a larger adversary's airpower without engaging in costly aerial interception.
