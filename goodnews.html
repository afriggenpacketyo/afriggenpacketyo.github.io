          <p>China and Cambodia have launched a direct air corridor for fresh fruit, marked by the first two-tonne shipment of Cambodian durians arriving in China's Henan province. This development, part of China's 'durian diplomacy,' allows the fruit to reach Chinese consumers in just four hours via cold chain logistics, ensuring freshness. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit approved for direct export to the vast Chinese market, following bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. The move signifies strengthening agricultural trade ties and improved customs efficiency between the two nations, though some industry insiders remain cautious about the fruit's commercial competitiveness.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel members to face justice in the United States. The group includes prominent figures such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the 'Los Cuinis' organization allied with the powerful CJNG cartel. This action represents a milestone in the U.S. Justice Department's priority to dismantle dangerous drug networks operating across the border. The transfer occurred after the U.S. agreed not to seek the death penalty, reflecting ongoing diplomatic negotiations and pressure to curb the flow of illicit drugs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in suspended science research grants to UCLA. The National Science Foundation (NSF) had abruptly frozen over $584 million in funding, citing the university's alleged failure to prevent antisemitism. However, U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the suspension violated her previous injunction against such terminations, calling the government's action a violation of the law. This ruling marks a critical victory for the university and its researchers, who argued their work was being held hostage for political reasons.</p>

This flight marks a major milestone for ULA, as the powerful Vulcan is designed to replace its aging fleet of Atlas V and already-retired Delta rockets. The launch from Cape Canaveral was the first to be certified by the Space Force for carrying costly and critical national security payloads. The Vulcan's success is crucial for ULA to compete in the modern launch market.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a year-long plan to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost sluggish domestic demand. According to the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of interest on loans for purchases in key sectors like automobiles and education, as well as for smaller single transactions. The policy is designed to lower the cost of credit for households, unlock their spending potential, and make domestic consumption a primary driver of the national economy. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy.</p>

          <p>In a bold move, artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust suit proposed that Google divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. While the bid is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, the company claims to have investor backing. This development underscores the fierce competition in the AI and tech sectors and highlights the strategic importance of web browsers as gateways to the internet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting in early 2026, the driving theory test in the United Kingdom will include questions on life-saving first aid skills, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of a defibrillator. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) is implementing the change with the hope of preventing avoidable deaths, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest. With 2.4 million people taking the test annually, the initiative aims to equip a large portion of the population with critical emergency response knowledge.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted a weeklong 'boil water' notice for approximately 9,200 households in the Granada Hills and Porter Ranch neighborhoods. The advisory was put in place after a faulty, 57-year-old underground valve impeded water flow, causing an outage. After complex repairs, the DWP has declared the water safe to drink but is urging residents to thoroughly flush their pipes, hot water tanks, and appliances to remove any stagnant water or sediment before resuming normal use.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that his country used 'repressive violence' in Cameroon during the West African nation's struggle for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost 'tens of thousands of lives.' This admission follows the findings of a historical commission, which detailed how French colonial troops used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement, with the violence continuing even after independence was declared in 1960.</p>

According to the LAPD chief, the crew would sometimes plant cameras to monitor their victims' routines before breaking in. The arrests followed an investigation into a series of similar burglaries targeting well-known figures in the city.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with major indices moving toward record highs, following the release of better-than-expected inflation data for July. The report, which showed consumer price inflation holding steady at 2.7%, fueled investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will have the leeway to cut interest rates at its September meeting. This prospect of lower borrowing costs boosted market sentiment, increasing traders' bets on a rate cut to over 90%. The positive data provides a potential buffer against economic concerns fueled by ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>
