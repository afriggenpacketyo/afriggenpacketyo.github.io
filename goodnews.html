          <p>Ree Drummond, the "Pioneer Woman," has recommitted to her health journey after experiencing weight fluctuations following a year-long break from her regular regimen. Drummond shared that she had stopped exercising and paying close attention to her diet, leading to weight gain. She has now returned to the plan that previously helped her shed over 50 pounds, focusing on building muscle through lunges, squats, deadlifts, and floor exercises with ankle weights. Additionally, she's prioritizing a higher percentage of protein in her diet while no longer strictly counting calories or weighing her food.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at easing trade tensions. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both nations. While Mr. Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick resolution, noting that even a reduction in tariff rates would still leave them significantly higher than before the trade war began. The article notes that China has been steadfast in saying it does not intend to make trade concessions in response to Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful. She contends that being flawed is an essential part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. The article challenges the societal pressure on mothers to constantly do more and highlights the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are already good enough, flaws and all.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn widespread condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum.

Trump's idea has united Iranians of all factions in opposition, highlighting the cultural and historical significance of the name.

          <p>Sany Heavy Industry, a major Chinese heavy equipment manufacturer, plans to utilize up to US$1.5 billion from a proposed Hong Kong IPO to fuel its global expansion. The company aims to double its overseas revenue within three years, focusing on developing countries in Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa. Sany will prioritize building localized marketing channels rather than establishing new factories. The company's revenue from overseas markets increased by 12% in 2024, representing nearly 65% of its total revenue.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated the redevelopment of a two-kilometer expressway in the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, expected to be completed by the 2040s. The Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the existing Tokyo Expressway, commonly known as the "KK Line," with plans for trees, flowers, benches, public restrooms, cafes, and event spaces. The project, inspired by New York City's High Line, aims to become a tourist attraction despite challenges related to heat, structural integrity, and costs.</p>

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona urged the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party at a town hall in Pennsylvania. Gallego argued that the party's increasing purity has led to the exclusion of potential voters. He used Joe Rogan as an example. Gallego, who won in a battleground state, highlighted the need for alliances with those who may not agree 100% of the time. He emphasized the importance of empathizing with voters and addressing their economic concerns.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming increasingly important suppliers. Yunnan, the southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a crucial role in regional agricultural cooperation. Through initiatives like the "alternative crop cultivation programme," Yunnan shares agricultural technology and promotes sustainable economic alternatives. This cooperation helps support China's food security by leveraging land resources in neighboring countries and diversifying its food supply sources.</p>
