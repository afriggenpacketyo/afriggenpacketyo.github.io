          <p>AVZ Minerals has temporarily halted its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo following encouragement from the U.S. government, which seeks to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. The U.S. is supporting KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, in an effort to acquire AVZ‚Äôs stake in Manono, with a pledge of $1 billion for development. This move aims to counter China's Zijin Mining, which gained control over the northern section of the project after Congo revoked AVZ‚Äôs rights in 2023. Washington's intervention highlights its increasing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo, directly challenging China‚Äôs dominance in the region crucial for the global green energy transition.</p>

          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, reflecting broader challenges in stimulating domestic consumption. While the Hollywood film *Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning* topped ticket presales, overall revenue for the first day of the holiday was lower than that of the previous public holiday. This comes amid a backdrop of declining box office revenue in China, which fell significantly last year. Despite these challenges, some observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of China's film market, citing improvements in domestic productions.</p>
