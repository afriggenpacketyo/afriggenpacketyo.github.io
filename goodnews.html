          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a move backed by several investors. The offer comes as the U.S. Department of Justice has proposed that Google divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine and recently launched browser, Comet, is positioning itself amidst the intense competition for AI dominance. Google has not yet responded to the bid or disclosed its plans following the antitrust ruling.</p>

          <p>The rapid advancement of quantum computing toward commercial viability is expected to create a new real estate boom, similar to the one driven by AI and data centers. According to a JLL report, as quantum technology matures over the next five years, it will require specialized facilities, distinct from traditional data centers, to house the supercomputers. This could trigger billions in investments by 2030, with development concentrated in existing research hubs like Chicago, Boston, and Silicon Valley, where access to academics, infrastructure, and an educated workforce is crucial.

          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group rose after the company reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase in its first quarterly earnings since going public, reaching $658.1 million. The growth was fueled by a 90% surge in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue and positive outlook reflect growing institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by more supportive crypto legislation. Circle also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain, named Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the safety of annuities for retirees amidst ongoing inflation and market volatility. It highlights that an annuity's security depends on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, as they are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, different annuity types carry varying risk profiles, from predictable fixed annuities to market-tied variable ones. The piece advises potential investors to consider the insurer's credit rating, the current interest rate environment, and the long-term threat of inflation eroding purchasing power.

          <p>Investment bank Piper Sandler has upgraded cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks to a buy-equivalent rating, raising its price target from $200 to $225 per share.

The upgrade also highlighted the value of the potential CyberArk acquisition in filling a key gap in Palo Alto's portfolio.

          <p>The Huron-Clinton Metroparks authority will recommend replacing the aging Flat Rock and Huroc dams on Michigan's Huron River with a series of rock arch rapids. This solution aims to address infrastructure concerns and improve fish passage for species like walleye and sturgeon, which have been blocked from their upstream migration from Lake Erie. Crucially, the rock arch design would maintain the water levels of the impoundment behind the dam, a key concern for local residents. The proposal is seen as a more financially and ecologically viable alternative to a full dam removal.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, author Anne Lamott reflects on finding hope amidst a challenging political climate by embracing absurdity and small acts of joy, like getting a manicure. She argues that laughter, particularly the brand of humor found in Monty Python, is a form of fearless, defiant hope that can agitate and confuse bullies who rule by fear. Lamott shares a humorous anecdote about getting her finger super-glued to her manicurist's hand, concluding that kindness is the "antivenom" and that doing hopeful things can help maintain one's spirit in terrifying times.</p>

          <p>Everton has completed the signing of Manchester City and England winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old, who became a record signing for City in 2021, said he was "over the moon" to join Everton, citing conversations with manager David Moyes as a key factor. After falling out of favor at Manchester City last season and being left out of the Euro 2024 squad, the move offers Grealish a chance to rejuvenate his career. He will wear the number 18 shirt, a nod to his favorite players Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne.</p>
