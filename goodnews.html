          <p>A severe geomagnetic storm may cause the Northern Lights to be visible as far south as Alabama on Sunday night into Monday morning. This rare occurrence offers a chance for many across a large portion of the country to witness the colorful streaks of light typically seen only in more northern latitudes. The phenomenon is due to increased solar activity interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating a spectacular display in the night sky. Observers are encouraged to find dark locations away from city lights for the best viewing experience. </p>

          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned to free his mother, Sally Challen, from prison in 2019 after she killed his father, Richard, who had subjected her to decades of coercive control. David has written a book called 'The Unthinkable' about his family's experiences, highlighting the insidious nature of non-physical domestic abuse. A 2015 law recognizing psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse helped secure Sally's release, providing a language to describe the abuse the family had normalized. David now works as a domestic abuse campaigner, advocating for greater protection for victims and sharing his story of intergenerational trauma to help others.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett indicated that President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping may discuss trade as early as this week. Hassett stated that while a specific date has not been set, both sides have expressed a willingness to talk. He added that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer's team is actively engaged in discussions with their Chinese counterparts. A conversation between Trump and Xi would represent a significant step in ongoing negotiations following a 90-day trade deal reached in Switzerland.</p>
