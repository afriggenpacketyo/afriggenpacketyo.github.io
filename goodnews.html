          <p>A program in Jay Em, Wyoming, called Operation Remount Corporation, is helping veterans cope with mental health challenges through equine therapy, pairing them with wild mustangs. The program addresses PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which are more prevalent among veterans, while also helping mustangs with traumatic backgrounds. Veteran Sean Walker, a participant, says his horse, Spirit, has significantly impacted his reintegration into civilian life after serving in Iraq and Bosnia. The program includes a new cabin for overnight stays and aims to expand to offer year-round therapy, fostering a therapeutic bond between veterans and horses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to pause in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama. FEMA initially halted on-site classes, citing that the government would no longer pay for travel for programs deemed not "mission critical." However, after a review, FEMA determined that certain courses provide effective training. This reversal followed criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters, who argued that pausing training for first-responders was dangerous and nonsensical.</p>
