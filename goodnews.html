          <p>A bill introduced in the House of Representatives proposes giving newborns $1,000 in accounts named after President Trump. Under the bill, children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets. Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. The bill has puzzled tax experts because gains in the accounts would be taxed when money was withdrawn, making them function much like a typical investment account.</p>
