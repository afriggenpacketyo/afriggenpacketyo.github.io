          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, starting November 21, has not yet been finalized. A key position in question is the number three batter, with a choice between vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old newcomer Jacob Bethell. Bethell has shown promising form recently but will have further opportunities to make his case in upcoming T20 and ODI matches. McCullum emphasized the need for players to rest and freshen up before the demanding winter schedule, highlighting the grueling nature of the current cricket calendar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals a growing divide in U.S. union membership, with states that protect collective bargaining rights seeing an increase in members while "right-to-work" states experience significant declines. In 2024, pro-union states added nearly 10,000 members, whereas right-to-work states lost 200,000. The analysis highlights that workers in right-to-work states earn about 7% less and face higher rates of discrimination. The findings suggest that state-level policies play a crucial role in the health of the labor movement and overall economic outcomes for workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has unveiled an ambitious plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The National Development and Reform Commission aims to roll out at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas industries. The strategy includes establishing a framework for AI integration by 2027, developing 100 application scenarios, and creating innovation platforms to train specialists. This initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to enhance its technological capabilities and create a smart, efficient energy system.</p>

          <h2>Economic Uncertainty, Not AI, is the Primary Driver of Current Labor Market Slowdown, Say Economists</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists argue that the recent slowdown in the U.S. job market is more attributable to general economic uncertainty than to AI-driven job replacement. Experts note that while some tech companies have announced AI-related layoffs, the broader impact remains small, with the tech industry comprising a relatively minor portion of the overall workforce. Instead, businesses are being conservative with hiring due to unpredictable economic policies. The article suggests that workers should focus on acquiring AI skills, as demand for them is growing, and AI is more likely to augment rather than eliminate many jobs.</p>

          <p>As part of a Goethe-Institut USA initiative called "Among Friends," two young German authors are undertaking a four-week reading tour across the United States. The tour, which will take Sonali Beher and Iven Yorick Fenker from New York to Texas, aims to encourage German-American dialogue amid strained transatlantic relations. The authors will share their work, engage in debates, and document their experiences, offering a youthful and diverse perspective on Germany. The project seeks to reach new audiences and explore how a new generation views the relationship between the two countries during a complex political period.</p>

          <h2>Investors Weigh Risks and Opportunities in Nuclear Energy Amid Surging Power Demand</h2>

          <p>A resurgence of interest in nuclear energy, driven by the power demands of AI and data centers, is creating new investment opportunities, though significant challenges remain. While tech giants are investing, the sector faces hurdles such as vast capital requirements, long construction times, and uncertain political and regulatory landscapes. The development of small modular reactors (SMRs) offers a more scalable solution but most are not expected to be commercially viable until 2030. Financial institutions are now more open to financing nuclear projects, but government support is still seen as essential to mitigate the substantial risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a traditional wig striking a protester on the ground, with blood splattering from their placard. Banksy claimed the work on Instagram, and its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest in London. The piece, which is critical of authority, has already been covered with plastic sheeting and is being guarded by security officials, continuing the artist's theme of creating provocative social and political commentary.</p>
