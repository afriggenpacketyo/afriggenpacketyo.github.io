          <p>A 71-year-old restaurant owner, who had lost movement in his left arm and leg after a stroke, has experienced significant recovery thanks to a new FDA-approved technology called the Vivistim System. The device, implanted at the Cleveland Clinic, uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. This first-of-its-kind technology has allowed the patient to regain function and reduce pain, offering new hope for stroke survivors whose progress has plateaued with traditional rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>The latest season of "South Park" has garnered significant attention for its direct and unrestrained satirical attacks on the Trump administration, leading to record ratings for the nearly 30-year-old show. Media analyst Brian Stelter discusses how creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are targeting figures like President Trump and Kristi Noem with a level of aggression not seen in their previous work. The article also examines the business context, noting that parent company Paramount is protecting the show's creators despite political pressure, largely due to a lucrative billion-dollar streaming deal that makes "South Park" a cornerstone of its business strategy.</p>

          <p>In the wake of increasingly destructive hurricanes like Ian, Floridians are seeking more resilient living solutions, from moving inland to retrofitting their homes. The article highlights Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be "storm-proof" with infrastructure like native plants for water absorption and reinforced homes, which sustained minimal damage during Hurricane Ian. It also covers efforts by nonprofits in lower-income areas like Miami's Coconut Grove to help residents rebuild stronger, elevated homes and install impact-resistant features, though funding for such mitigation projects remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>A new wave of younger, social-media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents across the country. Frustrated by what they perceive as an out-of-touch and complacent party establishment, these challengers argue that a new generation of leadership is needed to confront the challenges posed by the Trump administration. While incumbents defend their records and seniority, the insurgent campaigns reflect a growing demand within the party for fresh energy and a more urgent approach to politics.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has officially received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne, who attended the state-run reform school in the mid-1960s, dropped out to support his family but fulfilled a lifelong promise to himself by completing his degree through a compensation program for the school's victims. After the graduation ceremony, Horne expressed his happiness and said he hopes his story inspires others to overcome obstacles and never give up.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologists Recommend Tinted Sunscreen for Protection Against Visible Light</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>New research highlights that standard sunscreens do not protect against visible light, which can worsen conditions like hyperpigmentation and melasma, particularly in people with darker skin. Dermatologists now recommend tinted sunscreens containing iron oxide, as this ingredient effectively blocks visible light radiation in addition to the UV protection offered by standard active ingredients. While the availability of shades for diverse skin tones remains a challenge, experts suggest that using tinted products or layering foundation with iron oxide over regular sunscreen can provide more comprehensive skin protection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption on Hawaii's Big Island, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air. The activity, which began Friday morning, is contained within the summit crater of Halemaumau and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain this is part of an ongoing eruption cycle that began in December, driven by magma accumulating in chambers beneath the crater.</p>

          <p>Recent multinational military exercises, including the landing of British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets on a Japanese warship, signal Japan's strategy to diversify its defense collaborations. Analysts suggest that mixed signals from the United States are prompting Tokyo to strengthen security ties with other partners like the United Kingdom, Australia, and European nations. This strategic broadening is viewed as a way for Japan to enhance its military integration and bolster its position in the Indo-Pacific, with a particular eye on China's growing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>After a protracted five-year legal battle and decades of civil society activism, a street in central Berlin with a racist name is being officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse. The original name, Mohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," has long been criticized for its colonial and racist connotations, stemming from the 18th-century practice of enslaving Africans as "court moors." The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanaian-born scholar who was enslaved as a child but went on to become the first African to earn a doctorate from a European university in 1734.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the 27th season of "South Park" has succeeded where many other comedies have failed by delivering effective and genuinely funny satire of the second Trump administration. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have revived their anti-Trump commentary with gratifyingly mean-spirited caricatures of figures like Trump and Kristi Noem, avoiding the pitfalls of predictable, approval-seeking humor. By using its unique satirical toolkit, the show has become one of the most relevant and important comedic voices in the current political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Suggests Japan Should Cooperate with China on Infrastructure Instead of Competing</h2>

          <p>Japan has relaunched a major infrastructure initiative spanning Africa and the Indian Ocean, a move that could create competition and conflict with China's Belt and Road Initiative. This opinion article argues that instead of engaging in an "infrastructure war" for geopolitical influence, Tokyo and Beijing should cooperate on these massive projects. Such collaboration could prevent wasted resources, avoid incompatible technical standards, and leverage the expertise of multilateral development banks, which are increasingly being sidelined in favor of nationally sponsored programs.
