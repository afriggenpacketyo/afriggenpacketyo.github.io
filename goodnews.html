          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 23:57:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of American malls and shopping centers is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for small, local businesses, including health practitioners, artists, and independent retailers. With national vacancy rates rising to 5.8% and rent growth slowing, landlords are becoming more flexible with lease terms, offering shorter lengths, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods. This trend allows businesses previously priced out of prime locations to secure space, fostering local regeneration and unique community experiences. While challenges remain, particularly for landlords wary of small business failure rates and the need for "credit tenants," this shift represents a significant recalibration of the commercial property market, benefiting local entrepreneurs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's stock market has seen a significant rally this year, with the CSI 300 index climbing 16% and its IT index reaching 2015 highs, driven by progress in artificial intelligence, chip self-sufficiency, and government efforts against price wars. However, experts like Raymond Cheng of Standard Chartered question if this rally, largely fueled by retail investors shifting bank deposits, is disconnected from underlying economic fundamentals. While some analysts see potential for further retail participation, others, including Nomura, warn of excessive leverage and potential "bubbles" in specific sectors like contract research organizations and technology, as overall economic data still indicates a slowdown.

          <p>Country music icon Dolly Parton has announced the postponement of her upcoming Las Vegas concerts due to recent "health challenges" requiring "a few procedures." The 79-year-old artist, who experienced the loss of her husband earlier this year, assured fans she is in good spirits, humorously referring to it as her "100,000-mile check-up" rather than a typical plastic surgery visit. While she won't be able to rehearse for the December Vegas shows, she will continue working on her other projects from Nashville. The concerts have been rescheduled for September 2026, as Parton prioritizes being at her best for her dedicated audience.</p>

          <p>The karearea, New Zealand's only native falcon and its fastest bird, has been crowned Bird of the Year in the country's annual competition, attracting over 75,000 votes from 123 countries. Capable of flying 200 kilometers per hour, the karearea is a threatened species facing habitat loss and predation, with only 5,000 to 8,000 individuals remaining. The contest, organized by Forest & Bird, aims to raise public awareness about New Zealand's unique bird species, 80% of which are endangered, and the threats they face. The organization also expressed concern over successive governments' reduced investment in conservation, which is vital for protecting these iconic species.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group soared 36% on its market debut after parent company Sony Group spun off the unit, which includes Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank. The spin-off, valuing the company at over $6.7 billion, allows the financial arm to raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties. Sony cited competing investment demands in entertainment and semiconductors as a key reason for the financial unit's independence. While Sony Financial Group performed strongly, broader Japanese markets saw declines, though other Asia markets like Australia and South Korea traded mostly higher, reflecting varied regional economic sentiments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely expected to hold its key policy rate at 5.50% this week, though some economists suggest a surprise cut cannot be ruled out due to concerns over U.S. trade tariffs and a subdued inflation outlook. Major banks like Citi, Barclays, and Capital Economics have flagged the possibility of a cut, citing downside risks to growth and a benign inflation outlook. While India's economy grew a stronger-than-expected 7.8% in the June quarter, private investment remains weak, and financial conditions have tightened. Economists believe the RBI might act proactively to cushion against external shocks, positioning itself as a forward-looking central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses "energy vampires" in friendships—individuals who drain your energy through excessive complaining, self-focus, or a lack of interest in your life. Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common signs as an excessive need for attention and reassurance, or subtly undermining your mood through backhanded compliments or pressure to be upbeat. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests that how you feel after interactions is a key indicator. The article offers three strategies for handling such relationships: honest communication about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries if behavior doesn't change, and altering shared activities to reduce opportunities for dominance, such as opting for walks instead of intense chats. These steps aim to protect one's well-being in challenging friendships.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations for green marine fuels hinge significantly on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already implemented LNG and biodiesel fueling, green methanol requires a robust upstream-to-downstream system, including tax-free mainland-produced fuel for storage and sale. Wang's remarks coincided with the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. With Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs, CM Energy expects to increase its green methanol usage from 2027, despite the fuel currently costing four times more.</p>

This outcome, with over 99.5% of ballots counted, signals Moldova's continued trajectory towards the European Union. President Maia Sandu accused Russia of "massive interference" in the election, while her rival, Igor Dodon, claimed Western interference and called for protests. PAS lawmakers celebrated the victory as a win for democracy and Europe, despite pre-election polls suggesting they might lose their majority.
