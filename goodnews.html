          <p>The AI-driven boom in semiconductor stocks, led by Nvidia, is prompting Wall Street to create more concentrated investment vehicles. Beyond standard funds like VanEck's SMH, investors can now access ETFs with different strategies, such as equal-weighting (XSD) to reduce single-stock risk or a focus on fabless chipmakers (SMHX). These products cater to aggressive investors looking to capitalize on what some experts believe is the early stage of a "super cycle" in the chip industry, offering varied exposure to the global supply chain.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House, labeling the complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday struck down the suit on procedural grounds, criticizing its eighty pages of repetitive claims and political rhetoric as a violation of civil lawsuit rules. The judge granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile the lawsuit in a more "professional and dignified manner."</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran expressed his minority view that President Donald Trump's tariffs will not have a macroeconomically significant inflationary impact on the U.S. economy. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the Fed's recent decision to cut rates by a quarter-point, argued there is no evidence that import-intensive goods are inflating at a higher pace. He also anticipates stronger economic growth in the second half of the year and suggests that Trump's immigration policies will have a disinflationary effect. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the call, Trump stated he would visit China early next year and that the two leaders would also meet at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. While the U.S. and China have a framework for an agreement, it remains unclear if a final deal was completed, as a Chinese government statement only noted support for reaching a "proper deal."</p>

          <p>The resolution of TikTok's ownership in the U.S. may depend on a licensing agreement for its powerful and closely guarded recommendation algorithm.

However, experts warn that such an arrangement might not fully resolve national security concerns if it allows ByteDance to retain access to user data or influence content ranking from China.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. For a $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term, the estimated monthly payment has dropped to approximately $608, down from over $640 before the rate reduction. Since HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust to changes in the broader rate environment, making them potentially cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans, though borrowers must account for future rate volatility.

If these conditions are met, rates could potentially fall into the 5.5% to 5.75% range, offering significant savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance, though economic volatility could limit how far they fall.
