        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google plans to invest $15 billion over the next five years to establish a major artificial intelligence and data center hub in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. According to Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, this will be the company's largest AI hub outside of the United States, featuring a 1-gigawatt project. This significant investment reflects the surging global demand for cloud services and AI infrastructure, driven by the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence applications. The move is part of Google's broader strategy to expand its global data center capacity.</p>

The mission saw the Starship upper stage separate from its Super Heavy booster, with the booster performing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico and the upper stage landing in the Indian Ocean as planned. This flight marks the final test before SpaceX begins launching a new, more advanced version of the rocket designed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.

          <p>Shares of LG Electronics India surged over 45% upon their market debut, resulting in the subsidiary's market capitalization briefly overtaking that of its South Korean parent company. The Indian unit's initial public offering (IPO) was the most heavily subscribed in the country since 2008, attracting bids worth nearly $50 billion. The IPO was priced at the top of its range, raising $1.3 billion through an offer for sale by the parent company. This successful listing highlights strong investor confidence in India's consumer electronics market, which is projected to nearly double by 2029.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Blake Treinen secured a high-pressure save in a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series opener. Despite a shaky performance where he walked a batter to load the bases, Treinen managed to get the final out, marking a crucial step forward after a difficult postseason. The pitcher has been working on mechanical tweaks to regain his form from last year's World Series run, where he was a dominant force for the team. His successful close provided a moment of relief and a vital contribution to the team's important Game 1 win.</p>

          <h2>Scottish Teenager Advocates for Mandatory CPR Training in Schools After Losing Both Parents to Heart Conditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 01:23:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is campaigning for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to help save his father, who died from a cardiac arrest, if he had been trained in the life-saving skill. After successfully persuading his own school to introduce CPR lessons, he is now taking his 'Pulse of Life' campaign to the Scottish Parliament. Health charities support the initiative, noting that Scotland's low out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rate of one in ten could be improved if more people were equipped with CPR knowledge.</p>

          <p>The release of hostages as part of a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict has dominated the front pages of British newspapers, capturing moments of profound relief and reunion. Publications featured emotional images of freed individuals, such as Avinatan Or reuniting with his girlfriend and twins Gali and Ziv Berman embracing after being held separately for over two years. The coverage highlighted the joy felt by both Israelis and Palestinians as the truce took hold. However, some outlets also struck a note of caution, with analysts suggesting that achieving a lasting peace will require sustained diplomatic effort beyond the current U.S. administration's term.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for the implementation of a targeted national screening program for prostate cancer in the UK. Speaking as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argued that such a program is now affordable, deliverable, and could save countless lives. The proposal focuses on men at higher risk, including those aged 45-69 with a family history and Black men, who face double the risk. While advocates point to more reliable testing methods involving MRI scans, some medical experts remain cautious, citing the risk of over-treatment and its associated side effects.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have utilized artificial intelligence to restore a 1,600-year-old Chinese calligraphy masterpiece, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The original work, penned by the 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, has only survived in fragments, with about a quarter of its verses intact. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the surviving 250 characters, the scientific team used AI to replicate and complete the full 919-character scroll. This project demonstrates the potential of combining advanced technology with cultural preservation, offering a new way to experience and study ancient artistic works.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase the number of blood donors, particularly among young people, the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is partnering with NHS Blood and Transplant. People applying for a driving licence will now receive an email with a link encouraging them to register as a blood donor. Officials estimate this message will reach millions each year, targeting a key demographic, as over half of current regular donors are over 45. This new campaign hopes to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been part of the driving licence application since 1994.</p>

          <p>In his first game with the Chicago Bears, kicker Jake Moody successfully converted a 38-yard field goal with just three seconds remaining to secure a 25-24 victory over the Washington Commanders. Moody, who was recently signed to replace the injured Cairo Santos, was instrumental throughout the rainy Monday night game, scoring four field goals in total. The game-winning drive was set up after the Bears' defense recovered a fumble by Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels late in the fourth quarter. The dramatic win improved the Bears' season record to 3-2.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, led by a masterful performance from pitcher Blake Snell. Snell pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out ten batters in one of the best postseason starts in franchise history. The Dodgers overcame a bizarre fourth-inning double play that cost them a potential grand slam. Freddie Freeman's solo home run in the sixth inning provided the decisive run, and despite a tense ninth inning, the Dodgers' bullpen held on to take a crucial early lead in the series.</p>

          <p>A woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury after a fall has found a new way to communicate by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Tina, 59, was left with significant speech difficulties after being in a coma for six weeks in 2018. She says that learning BSL has helped her express words she cannot speak and has boosted her confidence. The journey was featured in a BBC series where deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis taught BSL to older residents at a retirement village, demonstrating that sign language can be a powerful communication tool for people beyond the deaf community.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of a 1.9% increase. Despite the strong performance, which was a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion, the country's central bank warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026. The manufacturing sector was a primary drag on growth, while the construction and services sectors also softened. In light of the outlook, the Monetary Authority of Singapore maintained its current policy settings, projecting that GDP growth will slow to a near-trend pace as global economic activity normalizes.
