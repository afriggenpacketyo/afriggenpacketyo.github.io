          <p>Everton's Jordan Pickford is firmly established as England's top goalkeeper, poised to break a national clean sheet record. Experts and former teammates highlight his exceptional reflexes, improved footwork, and long distribution as key strengths. While his animated temperament was once a concern, former England goalkeepers Paul Robinson and Rob Green, along with teammates Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott, note his increased maturity and consistent performances for both club and country. Despite other goalkeeping talents, Pickford's experience in major tournaments and ability to silence critics solidify his indispensable role for England.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 individuals, including hikers, guides, and staff, were successfully rescued from the Chinese side of Mount Everest after a severe snowstorm stranded them at over 4,900 meters altitude. The storm, which struck Saturday night, cut off access to their camps. While some hikers suffered hypothermia, rescue teams provided food, medicine, and oxygen, escorting them to safety. The scenic area has been temporarily closed. This incident follows other early-season snowstorms in western China, which resulted in one fatality from hypothermia and altitude sickness in the Qilian Mountains, highlighting the unpredictable weather challenges in the region.</p>

His wife, Laura O'Neill, discovered the news via a flurry of text messages after his phone was taken off airplane mode. Dr. Ramsdell, who shared the prize for his research into how the immune system combats infections, initially disbelieved the news. This comedic delay in notification marks one of the Nobel Assembly's most challenging attempts to contact a laureate, adding to a history of laureates learning of their wins in unusual circumstances.</p>

          <p>A pioneering technique involving enzyme-converted kidneys, successfully transplanted into a brain-dead recipient for two days without hyperacute rejection, offers significant hope for addressing the critical shortage of donated organs. Researchers from the University of British Columbia and West China Hospital of Sichuan University led the team, emphasizing the need for more efficient use of the existing human organ pool. This breakthrough could potentially improve organ allocation equality and reduce lengthy waiting lists, moving closer to practical application than engineered animal organs, which have faced recent failures in human trials.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Manager Explains Pitching Strategy for Roki Sasaki in Playoff Game 2</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts clarified his decision to use Blake Treinen instead of Roki Sasaki for a save opportunity in Game 2, aiming to manage Sasaki's workload due to his recent shoulder injury and new relief role. Despite Sasaki's dominant performances, the team is cautious about his usage, preferring at least one day of rest between outings. Treinen's subsequent struggles, allowing two runs, ultimately led to Sasaki entering for the final out. Roberts confirmed Sasaki is now the "primary option" for future save situations, but balancing his effectiveness with long-term health remains a key strategic challenge for the team.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author and illustrator Charlie Mackesy revealed that the completion of his new book, "Always Remember," took six years, partly due to the theft of his iPad containing early drawings and writings. The device, which held "quite a lot" of the book's initial content, was stolen from his unlocked car. Mackesy, known for his uplifting messages, described the setback as a challenge he overcame by "digging deep" to reconstruct the lost sections. This personal struggle, alongside the grief of losing his mother and beloved dog, underscores his belief that life is both beautiful and difficult, reinforcing the themes of connection and resilience found in his work.</p>

Ciattarelli's campaign refutes tax hike claims, while Earle-Sears faces connections to Trump's economic policies. These closely watched races, often seen as referenda on the sitting president, are heating up with legal threats and controversies, including the alleged release of a Democratic nominee's military records.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers worldwide were treated to a spectacular supermoon this week, appearing notably brighter and larger in the evening sky. This celestial event occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, its closest point to Earth in orbit.

The traditional name reflects the period when people in the northern hemisphere would hunt and preserve meats in preparation for the upcoming winter months, connecting the astronomical phenomenon with ancient human practices.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, endorsed by President Trump, has won a crowded Republican primary for a Tennessee House seat, setting him up against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in December. Van Epps' victory came after a late endorsement from Trump, who praised him as an "America First Patriot" and combat-decorated Army helicopter pilot. The special election is crucial for Republicans to slightly expand their House majority and will serve as a gauge of Trump's second-term agenda's popularity, particularly among suburban voters. Behn, a social worker, focuses on women's reproductive health rights, ensuring a ideologically charged general election.</p>

          <p>Former football star Herschel Walker has been confirmed by the Senate as the U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, marking the first such appointment in over a decade. President Trump nominated Walker last year, following his unsuccessful 2022 Senate bid in Georgia. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner and former NFL player, was previously on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. His confirmation, alongside over 100 other Trump nominees, occurred via a rules change by Senate Republicans to approve nominees "en bloc" amidst the ongoing government shutdown impasse, a move criticized by Democrats as "going nuclear."</p>

          <p>Shares of Trilogy Metals, a US-listed minerals explorer, surged over 200% after the White House announced a 10% stake in the Canadian company. This partnership includes a $35.6 million investment, aimed at unlocking domestic supplies of copper and other critical minerals in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The company welcomed President Trump's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project, reversing a previous administration's rejection. This move is intended to secure domestic supply chains for vital minerals used in energy infrastructure and defense, reducing reliance on China's dominance in the critical minerals market.

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed to enter our solar system, was photographed last week as it closely approached Mars. Images captured by two Mars orbiters show the faint comet, approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars, moving against a backdrop of distant stars. Scientists from the European Space Agency are analyzing the challenging observations, combining multiple images to enhance detection. The comet, first discovered in July, will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth, and is not considered a threat to our planet.</p>
