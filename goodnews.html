          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat popular from the 1940s to the 1970s, has largely vanished from American delicatessens and lunchboxes. Once seen as a visually interesting and affordable option for middle-class families, its decline began in the 1970s due to growing health concerns about processed meats, sodium, and preservatives. While it holds a nostalgic place for some, changing consumer preferences towards fresher, more natural foods and global cuisines have relegated it to a niche product. Experts believe a significant comeback is unlikely without a major rebranding to address modern health standards.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, including the release of all hostages, while indicating other aspects require further negotiation. U.S. officials view the response as positive, and Israel is reportedly preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages. The proposal involves an end to fighting, a phased Israeli withdrawal, and the establishment of a technocratic Palestinian body to administer the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in the deaths of seven civilians and three police officers, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to benefits for the political elite. The regional government has agreed to these demands and pledged to improve public services. The alliance leader expressed gratitude for the resolution and urged protesters to disperse from the capital, Muzaffarabad.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives a comfortable life on a monthly income of about $4,000. Sourcing his income from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English, he finds the cost of living allows him to escape the financial pressures he felt in the United States. He rents a two-bedroom apartment in a modern high-rise for $850 a month. Ryan feels that living in Vietnam has allowed him to move out of "survival mode" and focus on personal happiness and growth, a stark contrast to his previous experience.</p>

          <p>After a 20-year renovation project, the tomb of Amenhotep III, one of the largest in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, has reopened to visitors. The pharaoh, who ruled during the prominent 18th Dynasty, was buried in a vast tomb that was discovered in 1799 but had been looted of its contents. The extensive restoration, led by a Japanese team, focused on preserving the intricate paintings on the tomb's walls depicting the pharaoh with various gods. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism industry, a crucial sector for its economy.</p>

          <p>David Risher, now the CEO of Lyft, reflects on his 1996 decision to leave a management role at Microsoft to join the then-fledgling online bookstore, Amazon. Despite Bill Gates calling it "the stupidest decision," Risher was won over by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision and intense focus on the customer experience. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early. Risher, who became Amazon's 37th employee, was instrumental in this growth, finding the opportunity to build something at that scale incredibly exciting and a defining moment in his career.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist shares a parenting practice she started for her own children: creating a dedicated email address for each of them at birth. She uses these inboxes as a digital time capsule, sending messages on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times. This practice serves as a journal for the parent and builds a living legacy of stories, advice, and love for the children to read when they are older. The expert suggests it is a powerful way to preserve connection and ensure children have a collection of cherished memories and parental guidance throughout their lives.</p>

          <p>Fans of Taylor Swift are speculating that a track from her new album, titled "Actually Romantic," is a response to fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song's lyrics describe another singer who writes songs about hating Swift, which fans have connected to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a promotional film, Swift described her new song as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the speculation, but it has ignited widespread discussion among their respective fanbases.</p>

The diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma, caught before any symptoms appeared, allowed for effective treatment, including a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy. Her story underscores the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as early detection significantly improves survival rates for breast cancer.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, attributed her health and activism in part to a plant-based diet she adopted over 50 years ago. She made the change after looking at a pork chop and connecting it to the "fear, pain, death" of an animal, which instantly solidified her commitment. Goodall's primary motivations were ethical opposition to factory farming and concern for the environmental damage caused by meat production. She often encouraged others to reduce or eliminate meat consumption, believing it was crucial for both personal well-being and the health of the planet.</p>

          <p>The late primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of its place in the animal kingdom. Her journey began in the 1960s when, without formal training, she immersed herself in the world of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Her groundbreaking observation of a chimp named David Greybeard using a twig as a tool shattered the long-held belief that only humans made tools. This discovery, and the deep, trust-based relationships she formed with the animals, helped bridge the gap between humans and other species, leaving a lasting legacy in science and conservation.</p>

By liquidating retirement funds to start immediately, simplifying his blueprints, and being tenacious with contractors and agencies, he bypassed common delays.
