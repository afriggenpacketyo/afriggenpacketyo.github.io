          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing tariffs imposed by the United States. This growth reverses a trend of declines observed since the third quarter of the previous year, with cumulative profits for major industrial firms rising 1.4% year-on-year in the first four months of 2025. While exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline, overall exports surged due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations. The manufacturing activity in China experienced an unexpected contraction in April, Retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% from a year earlier while industrial output expanded 6.1% on year (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially affecting the high prices paid for teams in recent years. The legislation would allow owners to deduct only half the value of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, over 15 years. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams, potentially impacting current owners' investments. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change would raise $991 million over 10 years, though team owners argue the number is far higher (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer highlights several factors contributing to market optimism, including the European Union's grace under pressure in the tariff war and President Trump's awareness of Vladimir Putin's actions. He notes the U.S. House's passing of a bill and the EU's desire for fast-track trade, which could pressure Japan to act. Nvidia's upcoming report has low expectations, and the S&P Oscillator is at a low risk level. Cramer expresses a desire to have bought more stocks, particularly Capital One and TJX, and anticipates M&A deals, though he cautions against buying GE Vernova due to its parabolic arc (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with a local facility called "The Reserve" seeing an 88% increase in gold and silver storage orders. Industry watchers attribute this surge to concerns about tariffs and potential geopolitical instabilities. Clients are opting for physical gold bars over paper gold to limit price exposure and counterparty risks, particularly after the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. Vaulted gold may be less attractive for short-term investors, given that the transaction costs for purchasing and moving physical gold is higher than that of paper gold (not investment advice).</p>
