          <p>A research team from China’s Tsinghua University has developed a new approach to the “single-source shortest-paths” problem, a fundamental challenge in theoretical computer science. For 40 years, the standard method has been Dijkstra’s algorithm, which is limited by a necessary sorting step. The new method, published in a preprint paper on arXiv, bypasses this sorting process, focusing only on the shortest distances between key points to significantly reduce calculation time. This innovative work has already received acclaim, winning the Best Paper Award at the prestigious ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing held in June.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for the prompt and thorough implementation of policies designed to support the country's private economy, according to details of a February speech released by Beijing. He stressed that there should be no ambiguity, delay, or compromise in executing the party's decisions to aid private firms. Xi acknowledged that many businesses have reported limited tangible benefits from past relief policies and urged for more precise, reality-based measures. The speech underscored a commitment to ensuring a level playing field and protecting the lawful rights and interests of entrepreneurs, including addressing challenges like overdue payments from government entities.</p>

          <p>On India's 78th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a speech emphasizing national self-reliance, particularly in energy and defense, amid threats of increased U.S. tariffs over India's purchase of Russian oil. While not directly addressing the U.S., Modi stated that India must achieve energy independence to be truly self-reliant and vowed to protect the nation's agricultural interests. He also issued a warning to Pakistan, stating that India has a "new normal" of not tolerating "nuclear blackmail" and would not differentiate between terrorists and their supporters. This follows a major military confrontation between the two nations earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>At just 20 years old, undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma is set to face his most significant opponent yet, veteran Dillian Whyte, in a headline fight in Saudi Arabia. Itauma, who has 10 knockouts in his 12 professional wins, is a highly touted prospect known for his speed, power, and southpaw stance. While he has generated considerable hype since his debut, this match against a former interim world champion is seen as his crucial breakthrough fight. A victory could propel Itauma toward a potential world title shot, validating the widespread belief that he is a future star of the division.</p>

          <p>In a 'Short Wave' episode, developmental biologist Crystal Rogers joins a discussion to explore the complex criteria used to define life. The conversation examines the standard biological checklist—such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli—and applies it to straightforward cases like kittens versus grains of salt. However, the episode delves into more ambiguous examples that challenge these definitions, including viruses, which exist on the border of living and non-living. The discussion also ventures into futuristic, sci-fi scenarios, debating whether advanced androids could one day meet the criteria to be considered alive, blending scientific principles with philosophical questions.</p>

          <p>With about one in three adults experiencing some form of insomnia, finding ways to improve sleep is crucial, especially during summer heatwaves that disrupt the body's natural cooling process. Experts recommend several evidence-based strategies to enhance sleep quality and duration. Daily exercise, for at least 30 minutes, can boost melatonin production and reduce stress, while avoiding caffeine in the afternoon and evening is essential as its effects can linger for hours. Additionally, reducing screen time before bed and practicing deep breathing exercises, such as the "4-7-8" method, can help calm the nervous system and promote faster sleep onset.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to withhold federal funding. Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education's guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions to forbid any "race-based decision-making," violated procedural requirements. The memos had been criticized by education groups for creating a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech and causing chaos for educators. The ruling represents a significant victory for proponents of DEI initiatives, who had challenged the administration's actions in court.</p>
