          <p>Cory Bowman, Vice President JD Vance's half-brother and an evangelical pastor, is challenging Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval in the nonpartisan primary. Bowman, along with Republican challenger Brian Frank, aims to unseat the incumbent Democrat, Pureval, who previously served as a special assistant U.S. attorney and Hamilton County clerk of courts. Bowman stated that his half-brother‚Äôs inauguration inspired him to get involved in politics, emphasizing that he seeks to improve Cincinnati rather than engage in national politics. Voters will also decide on State Issue 2, a program reauthorizing $2.5 billion for local infrastructure projects over the next decade. </p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and increased tariffs on Chinese goods, e-commerce experts believe Temu and Shein will remain major players in the U.S. online retail market. These companies are implementing localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shipping goods in bulk to U.S. warehouses, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices on these platforms have risen, experts argue that Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and previously low prices will allow them to remain competitive. The success of these companies is attributed to their adaptive supply chains and small-batch production models.</p>

The article raises concerns about the competence and reliability of China‚Äôs military commanders due to these dismissals, suggesting it might weaken Xi‚Äôs appetite for war.

The European Commission is exploring ways for companies to exit existing contracts without facing penalties, though legal experts anticipate potential challenges. Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a significant decrease from 40% in 2022, but unanimous support for sanctions remains elusive due to opposition from Hungary and Slovakia.</p>
