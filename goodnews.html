          <p>A California appeals court upheld a $1 million jury verdict against the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect a middle school student from bullying. The student, Eleri Irons, sued the district in 2019, alleging she was verbally and cyberbullied by other students for nearly a year. The court found that the district's negligence, including in supervising and training employees, contributed to the harm suffered by Irons. The ruling confirms the district's responsibility to protect students from bullying.</p>
