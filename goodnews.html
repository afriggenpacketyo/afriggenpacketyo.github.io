        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a key component of his economic strategy. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties without congressional approval. The ruling specifically addresses tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking, stating they do not align with the threats outlined in the orders. Dow futures experienced a surge following the announcement, reflecting the market's positive reaction to the news, though the Trump administration has swiftly appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia reported earnings and revenue figures that surpassed expectations, driven by a 73% surge in its data center business. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this forecast is reduced due to export restrictions on its H20 chips bound for China. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is essentially closed to U.S. industry because of the export ban, which has affected their Hopper data center business in China. Despite these political challenges, Nvidia's growth continues to be propelled by strong demand for its AI chips, essential for applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, with large cloud providers contributing significantly to the data center unit's revenue.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform policies, likening him to former PM Liz Truss and warning that Reform's policies would lead to increased mortgage costs. Starmer accuses Farage of pledging unfunded tax cuts that could trigger an economic meltdown. Farage pledged more generous benefits for pensioners and parents and also a commitment to raising the threshold at which someone starts to pay income tax from ¬£12,570 to ¬£20,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the policy could cost between ¬£50bn and ¬£80bn a year ‚Äì and that Reform had not spelled out how they would raise the cash.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit between the two countries. This proposal could be used as a bargaining chip in ongoing bilateral talks regarding tariffs imposed by the United States. However, the negotiator also noted that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different standards and should not be directly mixed. Japan is hoping to schedule a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.</p>

          <p>Sawmills are actively recycling trees downed by Hurricane Helene to reduce wildfire threats and support domestic timber production. Many of the trees damaged by the storm are still usable for lumber, contributing to about 6% of the lumber production at some facilities. The removal of these dead trees reduces potential wildfire fuel and clears obstacles for firefighting efforts, like bulldozers creating firelines. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has allocated $23 million to clear dead trees from high-risk wildfire zones, which will then be sold to wood processing facilities.</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, stating that federal law did not grant him ‚Äúunbounded authority‚Äù to tax imports.

The ruling does not affect tariffs issued by the Trump administration under separate legal authorities, including levies on steel, aluminum and cars, and others that Trump has threatened on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other critical products.

Declared "nationally significant", the projects can speed through the planning process, though they could still be more than a decade away from opening. The announcement means that final decisions about the Fens Reservoir in Cambridgeshire and the Lincolnshire Reservoir will be taken by Environment Secretary Steve Reed, rather than at a local level. Experts warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate, and that the new reservoirs could prove unpopular with local communities.</p>

The resurgence is thanks to the work of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), set up when the population in the region had dropped to a mere handful. Satellite tagging confirms that some are beginning to venture into Northumberland and further afield and these sightings reaffirm the importance of us extending our groundbreaking work. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution by those who saw them as a threat to livestock or game birds.</p>

          <p>S. Jack Hu, former University of Georgia provost, has been appointed as the new chancellor of UC Riverside, starting July 15. Hu's appointment comes at a crucial time for the UC system, which faces challenges including funding cuts and scrutiny over diversity efforts. He will replace Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox, who is retiring after serving in the role since 2013. At Riverside, Hu will take the helm of a campus grappling with deep cuts to federal funding grants, including those from the National Institutes of Health, a UC-wide hiring freeze and a UC-wide Department of Justice investigation over allegations of antisemitic employment discrimination tied to pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping reaffirmed his plans for manufacturing-led growth during a visit to the northern province of Henan, pressing ahead with a strategy long criticized by the U.S. and major trade partners for deepening global trade imbalances. Xi told workers at a state-owned ball-bearing factory that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is "the right path" for China and the "backbone" of its economy. The manufacturing sector contributed to over 25% of China's GDP in 2023, according to the World Bank. There is "little scope" for China to budge and scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance, said Allan von Mehren, China economist at Danske Bank.</p>
