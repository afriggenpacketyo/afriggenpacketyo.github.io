          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal designed to prevent a U.S. ban of the social media app TikTok. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture, with Chinese parent company ByteDance owning less than 20%, to comply with a divest-or-ban law. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake and manage the app's algorithm and U.S. user data to address national security concerns. The new entity is reportedly valued at approximately $14 billion, with the White House expressing confidence that it satisfies all legal requirements.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Thursday that he would not permit Israel to annex the occupied West Bank, stating, "It's time to stop now." This public declaration aligns with reports that he had privately assured Arab leaders he would oppose such a move. The statement comes as some hardline members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have advocated for annexation in response to several Western nations recognizing a Palestinian state. Annexation of the territory, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967, is widely viewed as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers head into their 13th consecutive postseason after clinching another National League West title, this article reflects on the rarity of their sustained success. It contrasts the Dodgers' consistent playoff appearances with the majority of MLB teams whose seasons are now over. The piece quotes former Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen on the difficulty of making the playoffs and how fans should not take this successful era for granted. While fan anxiety about winning the World Series is expected, the article encourages a moment of appreciation for the team's remarkable consistency.</p>

Officials noted that while food inflation remains stable, price increases have returned for non-food merchandise, particularly imported goods.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their 12th National League West division title in the last 13 years with an 8-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite a regular season that fell short of lofty preseason expectations due to injuries and inconsistent play, the team has now won 12 of its last 17 games. Manager Dave Roberts expressed that the team is playing its best baseball of the season heading into the playoffs. The win ensures the Dodgers will open the postseason at home in the best-of-three wild-card round next week, as they aim to become the first MLB team in 25 years to win back-to-back championships.</p>

          <p>An Oregon murder suspect who was mistakenly released from a Multnomah County jail earlier this week has been arrested following a multi-day manhunt. The 26-year-old was facing charges of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery but was accidentally released on bail due to a clerical error regarding his bail status. The Multnomah County Sheriff called the incident a failure and committed to a full review to prevent future occurrences. The suspect was apprehended at a gas station in Florence, Oregon, resolving a situation that had caused significant distress for the victim's family and the community.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, analysts anticipate a major focus on reinforcing its domestic supply chains and advancing its position in the global value chain. Despite having a world-leading manufacturing ecosystem, China still has vulnerabilities in key high-tech areas. The new plan is expected to address these chokepoints and build on existing strengths to ensure long-term resilience. This strategy is exemplified by products like the iPhone, where final assembly may occur elsewhere, but critical components still originate from China's comprehensive and refined industrial network, underscoring its pivotal role in global manufacturing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has given preliminary approval to AI company Anthropic's proposed $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged copyright infringement. The lawsuit claimed that Anthropic illegally used books from pirated databases to train its AI models, including its well-known assistant, Claude. Under the settlement terms, which represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, the company will pay authors and destroy the datasets in question. The case has been closely watched as it helps to define the legal boundaries of copyright in the age of generative artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's approval, TikTok's U.S. operations are set to be controlled by a new joint venture majority-owned by American investors, including Oracle. This move is designed to address national security concerns over the app's ties to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The new entity will control a retrained version of TikTok's powerful algorithm, which will run solely on U.S. user data stored on Oracle's servers. This structure satisfies a 2024 law requiring the app to be sold or banned, allowing its 170 million American users to continue accessing the platform while ensuring their data is managed domestically.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that focusing on China's cooling property market overlooks the country's broader economic strengths that are paving the way for sustainable growth. The author contends that China has built a resilient economic foundation through synergistic investments in green infrastructure, digital connectivity, and scientific research. The piece highlights China's global leadership in producing highly cited scientific papers and its dominance in 57 out of 64 key technologies, according to one institute. These interlocking strengths are enabling a transition to a more diversified and high-quality economy, moving beyond previous reliance on a single growth source.</p>

          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected boost, with industry analyst Cox Automotive raising its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units. This increased demand is attributed to consumers buying vehicles now to avoid potential future price hikes from tariffs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits. While this has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota in the short term, analysts predict the sales pace will slow in the fourth quarter and into next year. The current trend shows larger, established brands gaining market share while smaller automakers are struggling. (not investment advice)</p>
