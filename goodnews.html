          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 15:09:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mortgage purchase rates have recently fallen, refinancing rates remain elevated, making it costly for many homeowners to access their home's equity through a traditional cash-out refinance. This article outlines two alternative methods for borrowing against home equity without altering an existing low-interest mortgage. Homeowners can consider a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which offers a variable rate and flexible borrowing, or a home equity loan, which provides a lump sum at a fixed rate. Both options allow homeowners to leverage their equity while waiting for a more favorable refinancing climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's credible threat to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that while the commercial terms of a deal had been settled for months, China paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements in April. The President's willingness to prioritize national security over the app's continued operation reportedly "turned the tide," leading to the current agreement. The White House has once again extended the divestiture deadline for ByteDance to December 16, providing time for the deal to be finalized between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of affluent shoppers are turning to discount stores like Walmart, Aldi, and Dollar General, a trend that has accelerated since 2021 due to persistent inflation. According to GlobalData Retail, nearly 28% of high-income households now frequent these budget retailers as rising living costs erode the financial cushions they once had. In response, stores like Walmart are actively courting these wealthier customers by remodeling stores for a better shopping experience and expanding their selection to include premium brands. This shift reflects a broader consumer trend of seeking better value for money on essential goods as household budgets tighten across all income levels.</p>

          <p>Science writer Mary Roach's new book, "Replaceable You: Adventures in Human Anatomy," explores the history and future of transplant science, from 16th-century prosthetic noses to modern breakthroughs. The book delves into topics like xenotransplantation, explaining why pigs became the primary animal for organ harvesting, and the genetic editing required to prevent hyperacute rejection by the human body. Roach also examines cutting-edge research, such as 3D-printing functional heart tissue, but expresses concern that recent cuts to medical research funding could stifle future innovation. The work continues her tradition of investigating the remarkable and often overlooked functions of the human body.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 14:48:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the mortgage market is experiencing volatility, prompting advice for prospective homebuyers this September. Experts recommend that buyers lock in a rate they can afford now, as rates have fallen to nearly one-year lows but could rise again unpredictably. Homebuyers are also urged to shop around with multiple lenders, as responses to Fed cuts will vary, and to explore all options, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points to secure a lower rate. The guidance emphasizes that assuming rates will continue to fall could be a costly mistake in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google's generative AI application, Gemini, has claimed the top spot among free apps on the Apple App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT. The surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana that allows users to blend and creatively modify photos using prompts. A company executive reported that the app gained 13 million new users and saw 500 million image uploads following the update, with demand so high that temporary usage limits were required. This success has also boosted investor confidence, contributing to parent company Alphabet's shares rising 33% this year and joining the $3 trillion market cap club.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a fourth extension for the enforcement of a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations, pushing the deadline to December 16. This delay follows an announcement that U.S. and Chinese negotiators have reached a "framework" for a deal, with a call between Trump and President Xi Jinping planned to finalize the details. The bipartisan law, aimed at mitigating national security risks posed by the app's Chinese ownership, has been paused repeatedly by the Trump administration. Critics argue the non-enforcement is a flagrant disregard of an unambiguous law, while others suggest it keeps the app operational, making a potential sale more viable.</p>

          <p>Despite an industry-wide trend of scaling back growth due to an oversupply of flights, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby remains confident in his company's expansion plans. Kirby stated that United's growth is outpacing rivals because customers are choosing the airline for its superior product, network, and technology, such as its mobile app and onboard amenities. He believes the airline's brand loyalty provides resilience during economic downturns and positions it for significant upside when the economy recovers. United's domestic capacity is set to grow by 5.7% in 2025, significantly higher than the average U.S. airline's expansion of just under 2%.</p>

However, new uncertainties are emerging, including pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for the EU to impose tariffs on countries like China and India for their energy deals with Moscow.

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has pushed back against criticism from pundits regarding the club's £450 million expenditure on eight new players this summer. Slot emphasized that the spending was largely offset by recouping over £250 million from player sales, arguing it was necessary to strengthen the squad. He defended the club's strategy of signing promising players aged 25 or under, including the British record £125 million signing of striker Alexander Isak. Slot asserted that Liverpool "did great business" and should be praised for its self-sustaining financial model, which he believes positions the team for long-term success.</p>

This expansion marks a significant step for Waymo, which already operates in surrounding areas but did not previously have permission to service the airport.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates, savers are encouraged to consider long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in current high yields. A 2-year CD offers a balance of a guaranteed return over an extended period while providing flexibility for future financial strategy. With top rates currently around 4.06%, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $828 in interest over the 24-month term. This article explains that while variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings offer more liquidity, their rates will likely fall with Fed cuts, making fixed-rate CDs an attractive option for protecting returns.
