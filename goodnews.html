          <p>The annual MLS All-Star game provided entertainment for fans, but the absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, has intensified a debate about the event's purpose and format. While the game serves as a mid-season business and media event, Messi's decision to skip it in favor of preparing for a meaningful league match highlights a potential culture clash. The article suggests that while the event is a fixture of American sports, MLS may need to rethink its approach to keep it relevant and ensure its top players are invested.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has declared President Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's decision. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's efforts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil. The article provides historical context, noting the amendment was established after the Civil War to grant citizenship to formerly enslaved people, and that the case is likely headed for the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day is enough to significantly reduce the risk of serious health problems like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. This finding challenges the widely promoted but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. Researchers believe this more attainable target could encourage more people to track their activity as a practical way to improve their health, noting that benefits tend to level off beyond this number for most conditions.</p>

          <p>An oceanography student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography was shocked to discover a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach. These pelagic creatures, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts that keep them afloat, are typically found in warmer tropical seas. This is the first time in a decade that Scripps researchers have spotted the snails locally, and its appearance coincides with unusually warm offshore water, prompting speculation about its connection to climate change.</p>

          <p>In a surprising reversal, San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers stated he prefers playing defense after making his debut at first base. This contradicts his previous stance with the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about serving exclusively as a designated hitter and had publicly rebutted suggestions of a position change. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats, a change in perspective that comes after a tense spring training with his former team over this very issue.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, narrowly avoiding a technical recession and beating economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, with domestic consumption still sluggish and the external trade environment uncertain, analysts suggest the pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>

By Wednesday evening, firefighters had successfully stopped the fire's forward rate of spread and achieved 5% containment, with crews remaining on scene overnight for mop-up operations.</p>
