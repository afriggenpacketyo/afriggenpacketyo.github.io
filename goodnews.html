          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 leading companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage private investment in the nation's economy. This "Made for Germany" initiative aims to restore confidence after two consecutive years of recession, with little economic improvement anticipated for 2025. The government has already committed to tax relief and a €500-billion infrastructure and climate fund but emphasizes that public funds alone are insufficient to stimulate the required growth. The talks are a critical effort to address Germany's ongoing economic sluggishness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese-led infrastructure projects in Guinea and Algeria are set to facilitate the export of iron ore to China starting this year. The completion of new railway lines and port facilities will resolve long-standing logistical issues that have previously hindered shipments from both African nations. In Guinea, the Simandou mine is expected to begin exporting by November, a project jointly developed by Rio Tinto and Chinese firms. Similarly, a new rail network will connect the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria's Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports, opening up another significant source of iron ore for China's market.

          <p>Owen Farrell has been named captain for the British and Irish Lions' upcoming match against a First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This marks Farrell's first start of the tour, where he will play at inside centre in a lineup that excludes players from the first-Test victory over Australia. The squad for this midweek game features nine Scottish players and includes all of the team's 'geography players' brought in as cover. The match provides an opportunity for several players to contend for a spot in the second Test, as coach Andy Farrell rests his primary team.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide last year at 55, is organizing 'A Day for Thorpey' to celebrate his life and raise mental health awareness. The event will take place on what would have been his 56th birthday during the fifth England-India Test at The Oval, his former home ground. In partnership with the charity Mind, specially designed headbands will be sold to fund 'Thorpey's Bat and Chat' sessions, an initiative supporting mental health through cricket. His family hopes to reduce the stigma around suicide and encourage people to seek help early.</p>

          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a leading competitor across the artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded its focus from telecommunications to a wide range of AI technologies, including advanced semiconductors, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key rival to American firm Nvidia. This strategic pivot was largely driven by U.S. sanctions, which inadvertently spurred Huawei to become a national champion in China's tech race. The company is now a vertically integrated player, developing everything from AI chips to industrial AI applications.</p>

          <p>The northeastern Chinese city of Hegang, facing economic decline and a shrinking population, is investing 1.2 billion yuan in a new airport as part of a strategy to revitalize its economy. Scheduled to open in 2027, Luobei Airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually, aiming to boost trade, particularly with neighboring Russia. The city's population has fallen to 850,000 from 1.1 million, and its GDP has decreased in recent years. This infrastructure project represents a significant gamble on improving connectivity to reverse its economic fortunes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is blamed for a surge in violence that has plagued Ecuador and is also suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition follows a referendum where Ecuadoreans approved the measure, supporting President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are showing potential as an effective treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients and small-scale studies report that these medications can lead to significant weight loss, regulate menstrual cycles, and reduce other symptoms like hair loss and insulin resistance. While not yet approved for PCOS, the drugs' ability to improve metabolic health addresses key underlying issues of the condition. However, the high cost and lack of insurance coverage for this unapproved use remain significant barriers for many patients seeking treatment.</p>

While she has expressed support for left-leaning figures like Bernie Sanders, she also revealed she made a promise to UFC President Dana White not to speak negatively about Donald Trump. This was due to Trump's early support for the UFC when the organization struggled to find venues. Rousey emphasized that while she honored her promise to White, she believes strongly in the individual's right to vote privately and encourages civic participation regardless of political affiliation.</p>
