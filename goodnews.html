          <h2>Nescafé Shifts Strategy to Attract Gen Z with Cold Coffee Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 05:25:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee giant Nescafé, owned by Nestlé, is strategically targeting Generation Z by expanding into the cold coffee market, which now constitutes a third of out-of-home coffee consumption. The company aims to shift its brand perception from a hot, morning beverage to an all-day, customizable cold drink, appealing to younger consumers' preferences. This move is part of Nestlé's broader strategy to refocus on core, high-growth categories like coffee, following a period of lagging sales. Nescafé also sees an opportunity to position its products, including decaffeinated options, as sophisticated alternatives to alcohol for evening social events.</p>

          <h2>Financial Therapists Offer Guidance on Making Mindful Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To foster better spending habits, financial therapists suggest consumers ask themselves a series of critical questions before making a purchase. These include evaluating if the purchase taps into essential funds, if it's driven by an emotional need, or if it's part of a compulsive pattern. Experts like Aja Evans and Brian Vines also recommend questioning whether the purchase is meant to impress others and whether sufficient research has been done to ensure value. By being more intentional and considering underlying motivations, individuals can avoid impulsive spending, stick to their budgets, and make choices that align with their genuine wants and needs.</p>

          <p>The Syrian government has announced a ceasefire and the deployment of security forces to the southern province of Suwayda to restore order after days of intense fighting. The clashes, involving Druze and Bedouin armed groups as well as government forces, have reportedly killed over 260 people and displaced 80,000. The situation was further complicated by Israeli air strikes against Syrian military targets, which Israel claimed were to protect the Druze minority. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa stated he received international calls to intervene and welcomed the U.S.-supported truce, emphasizing the need to preserve national unity and end the bloodshed.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being celebrated as a landmark moment for the city's Muslim and South Asian communities. His campaign, which focused on affordability and social justice, was propelled by grassroots organizations that significantly increased voter turnout in their neighborhoods. For many, Mamdani's rise signifies a shift in American political representation, challenging assumptions about who can lead a city shaped by post-9/11 Islamophobia. While his identity is a source of pride, supporters emphasize that his success was built on a political program that addressed deep-seated inequalities, resonating with a diverse coalition of voters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has cautioned that media reports speculating on the cause of the Air India Boeing Dreamliner crash that killed 270 people are premature. The statement followed the release of a preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which noted a cockpit voice recording where pilots discussed the engine fuel cutoff switches just before the crash. This detail led to widespread media speculation, including suggestions of intentional pilot action, which the AAIB has condemned as irresponsible. The NTSB emphasized that complex investigations take time and urged patience until a final report is issued.</p>

          <p>British MMA fighter Dakota Ditcheva, who became the first British woman to win a PFL world title in 2024, has expressed frustration over the difficulty in finding her next opponent. After a dominant year with four victories, the 26-year-old says her momentum stalled due to a lack of available challengers in her division. After an eight-month wait, Ditcheva is now set to fight American Sumiko Inaba in Cape Town, South Africa, in the first major MMA event held on the continent. Despite the frustrating delay, she believes the time off has built anticipation for her return to the cage, where her exciting striking style has made her a fan favorite.</p>

Coach Steve Cherundolo acknowledged the learning experience from playing against high-budget international teams and stressed that statistics will not matter in the intense atmosphere of the derby. The Galaxy, currently at the bottom of the Western Conference, will look to spoil the party despite their poor form and recent loss to Austin FC.</p>

Dubois aims to become the undisputed champion by avenging his 2023 loss to the 38-year-old Ukrainian. Some experts, like Tony Bellew, predict Usyk will win by a late stoppage but may have to survive a knockdown from the powerful Dubois. Others, such as Eddie Hearn, believe Usyk's incredible form against top opponents will lead to a comfortable points victory. However, some are backing Dubois, citing his recent impressive performances and exceptional power as key factors that could lead to an upset.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. Instead of engineering the cells in a lab, this innovative approach uses gene therapy tools to produce the anticancer cells directly within the patient's body. The team successfully used this technique to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, a common blood cancer. This breakthrough could make the powerful immunotherapy, which currently costs over $139,000 per treatment, significantly more accessible and easier to administer to patients in need.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed into law the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation, a major victory for the crypto industry, requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets and could pave the way for their mainstream use in payments. Supporters, including the Treasury Secretary, argue the law will bolster the dollar's global status and increase demand for U.S. Treasuries. However, critics express concern that the bill lacks strong anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. financial system a haven for illicit activities. (not investment advice)</p>
