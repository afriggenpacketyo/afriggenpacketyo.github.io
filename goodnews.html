          <p>An Israel-Hamas peace deal, brokered by the U.S. and regional mediators, is set for approval, initiating a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release 48 hostages held for over two years. The agreement's first phase involves returning 20 living and 28 deceased hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza, and the release of approximately 1,950 Palestinian prisoners. Preparations are underway at Israeli medical centers to provide specialized trauma-informed care for the returning hostages, who have endured horrific conditions. The successful implementation of this initial phase is seen as a crucial step toward a more durable peace in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England and Wales has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing laws, potentially allowing pubs and bars to extend their opening hours. The proposed reforms aim to reduce red tape and boost economic activity by making it easier for venues to serve outdoors and host live music. While hospitality industry groups have welcomed the move as a way to cut costs and increase flexibility, critics warn that relaxing alcohol sales regulations could lead to a rise in antisocial behavior. The review will gather evidence for four weeks, with landlords and local communities invited to contribute their perspectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to strong growth in its international markets. The company's net sales rose 2.6% to $23.94 billion, though it continues to face challenges in North America, where sales volumes for both food and beverages declined. Despite the softer domestic demand, PepsiCo has reiterated its full-year financial outlook, projecting stable earnings per share and low single-digit organic revenue growth. The results highlight the company's reliance on global performance to offset struggles in its home market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new three-part Netflix documentary, Victoria Beckham speaks openly about her past struggles with an eating disorder, explaining how the condition made her adept at lying and concealing her health. The series provides an inside look at her life, from her rise to fame with the Spice Girls to her reinvention as a successful fashion entrepreneur. Beckham reflects on the intense media scrutiny over her weight and the challenges she faced in her post-music career, including near-financial ruin for her fashion business.

          <p>Inter Miami is set to play its final MLS regular season game at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale before moving to its new, purpose-built 25,000-seat arena in Miami Freedom Park next season. The temporary stadium, built on the site of the derelict Lockhart Stadium, became an iconic venue following the arrival of Lionel Messi, drawing global attention. While fans look forward to the modern amenities of the new stadium, many express a genuine affection for the intimate, no-frills atmosphere of their current home. The move represents the fulfillment of the club's original vision to be based in Miami proper.</p>

          <p>Ferrero North America is investing more than $100 million in major marketing campaigns centered on the upcoming Super Bowl and World Cup. The push begins with the company's first-ever Super Bowl ad, which will feature its Kinder Bueno brand, followed by a wide-ranging promotional campaign across nearly all its brands during the World Cup. This significant bet on sports marketing is part of a broader strategy to increase its presence in the U.S., where it is now the third-largest candy company. The goal is to leverage the massive live audiences of these events to reintroduce the full Ferrero portfolio to North American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lawsuit brought by plaintiffs including the group Mormon Women for Ethical Government (MWEG) has compelled Utah's legislature to redraw the state's congressional district map. The lawsuit successfully argued that the previous map, which split the Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County into four separate districts, constituted an illegal partisan gerrymander. The court-ordered redistricting improves Democrats' chances of winning a House seat in the heavily Republican state. MWEG, a cross-partisan organization, framed its involvement not as a political fight but as a principled effort to uphold the democratic process and ensure representative government.</p>

          <p>This essay traces the philosophical origins of the Declaration of Independence's core principle that all humans possess innate rights to life and liberty. It argues that this idea was a radical departure from millennia of hierarchical societies where rights were conferred by rulers. The author posits that while influenced by the Enlightenment, the concept's deepest roots are in the Book of Genesis, which declares that all humanity is created in the image of God, affirming the intrinsic value of every individual. This moral foundation, which Jefferson adapted, defied the traditional views of power and worth that had dominated history.</p>

          <p>On July 4, 1777, members of the Continental Congress gathered at Philadelphia's City Tavern to celebrate the first anniversary of American independence. This article reconstructs the likely menu of that historic meal, offering a glimpse into the culinary world of the 18th century. The dishes served would have reflected a uniquely American cuisine influenced by global trade, featuring local fish and game prepared with Old World techniques and spices from Asia. The meal, from turtle soup and roasted turkey to apple pie, was a product of the same global connections and revolutionary identity that were shaping the new nation.</p>

          <p>A recently discovered ceremonial parchment of the Declaration of Independence in West Sussex, England, has led to new research into its original owner, Charles Lennox, the third Duke of Richmond. This article reveals the Duke as a leading radical in British politics who supported American independence and advocated for universal male suffrage in Britain. The author presents evidence of a previously unknown connection between the Duke and Thomas Paine, who lived and worked in Sussex before writing "Common Sense." This link suggests that the intellectual ferment for revolution had deep roots within the British elite, not just in the American colonies.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza have reacted to the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage-release deal with a complex mix of joy and profound pain. Many celebrated the prospect of an end to two years of devastating war, but the relief is tempered by the immense loss and destruction they have endured. For those who have lost family members and homes, the ceasefire brings the difficult task of confronting their grief without the distraction of daily survival. The agreement offers a glimmer of hope for a return to safety, but residents are acutely aware of the difficult period of rebuilding that lies ahead.</p>
