        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The shares of dual-listed Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are now at their smallest discount compared to their mainland counterparts in nearly five years. This narrowing gap, tracked by a Hang Seng gauge, is attributed to a weaker U.S. dollar prompting global investors to diversify, alongside strong buying from mainland investors seeking exposure to China's leading tech firms. Analysts suggest that Hong Kong stocks remain attractive due to their relatively low valuations and are poised to benefit from the rebalancing of global capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of nations is increasingly positioning itself as a significant geopolitical force challenging the era of unipolar global dominance. At a recent summit, leaders condemned coercive economic tactics and promoted de-dollarization, signaling a united front against U.S. unilateralism. However, this opinion article notes that the bloc faces internal contradictions, with members like India and Brazil balancing their own diplomatic interests, which could undermine its coherence. The central question remains whether BRICS can transition from a strategic partnership into a genuine alternative to the G7.</p>

          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing age verification for its UK users to prevent minors from accessing mature content, ahead of the new Online Safety Act regulations. The company will use a third-party firm, Persona, to verify age via a selfie or government-issued ID, stating that it will not store the photo itself. UK regulator Ofcom has endorsed the move, warning other companies to implement similar robust checks or face significant fines. Critics, however, raise concerns about data privacy and the potential for circumvention by determined minors.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 stock index has reached a new all-time high, breaking the 9,000-point barrier for the first time. Analysts attribute the surge to several factors, including investors diversifying away from US markets due to trade policy uncertainty and the UK's perceived stability from having a trade deal with the US. The index, often criticized for its reliance on traditional industries, is now seen as a reliable haven in an uncertain global economic climate. Sectors like precious metals, defense, and engineering have seen significant gains, contributing to the market's strong performance this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England secured a dramatic 22-run victory over India in the third Test at Lord's, led by an inspirational performance from captain Ben Stokes. Six years to the day after his 2019 World Cup final heroics at the same venue, Stokes delivered marathon bowling spells despite recent injuries, taking crucial wickets to clinch the win. His efforts were complemented by the successful and electrifying return of fast bowler Jofra Archer after a four-year absence from Test cricket. The win gives England a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, showcasing the team's resilience under pressure.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup, FIFA is already considering expanding the tournament to 48 teams by 2029. Despite initial criticism, the event proved commercially successful, with a $1 billion prize fund attracting top clubs and generating significant revenue. Real Madrid has even proposed holding the tournament every two years, though FIFA currently has no plans to do so. The qualification process and venue for the 2029 edition remain undecided, but the strong financial results and broadcast engagement suggest the expanded format is here to stay.</p>

The designation for the 29 sites was seen as a significant boost to Macau's efforts to broaden its appeal beyond being just a gambling destination. The landmarks, which include many Portuguese-style buildings, were recognized for their key role in the earliest cultural exchanges between the East and West. At the time, Macau's chief executive described the collection of sites as a 'unique, peerless jewel' for the region.</p>

While the government and some drivers welcome the move, critics argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the lack of public charging infrastructure, not just the initial purchase price.</p>

Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading, grip, and a crucial switch to a mallet-style putter, which sparked a remarkable turnaround.

The Trump administration had moved to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for this group, which would have made them eligible for deportation. An immigrant advocacy group sued to block the revocation, and while a lower court judge did not grant an injunction, the appeals court stepped in with a one-week stay to consider the case.

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with fully electric cars now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025. This success is the result of long-term government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs, higher taxes on polluting vehicles, and heavy investment in public charging infrastructure. In cities like Oslo, up to 40% of all passenger cars on the road are now electric, leading to cleaner air and quieter streets.
