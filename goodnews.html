          <p>Learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, including memory and problem-solving skills. The brain's neuronal structures change as people become more proficient in a new language, a process known as neuroplasticity. This structural change also changes the way the brain functions as it physically changes the way neurons communicate. Research indicates that young children learn new languages more easily than adults due to their brains' greater adaptability.</p>
