          <p>Pep Guardiola addressed the absence of Jack Grealish from a recent match, while also hinting at potential changes within the Manchester City squad. Several players, including Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker, may be departing, with new faces expected to join the team. Guardiola emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong squad and expressed confidence in the existing players. The club is also undergoing an off-pitch transition with a new director of football taking over, and the team is looking to make amends for a disappointing campaign.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani threw a live batting practice session, marking a significant step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery. Ohtani threw 22 pitches to hitters, reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball and incorporating his full repertoire. The session was conducted in an empty Citi Field, and Ohtani appeared to be in good spirits, joking with coaches and teammates. While the Dodgers remain cautious about setting a specific timeline, it is anticipated that Ohtani will return to the rotation sometime after the All-Star break.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cannes 2025 red carpet saw changes to the dress code, prohibiting nudity and voluminous gowns. Nudity is prohibited "for decency reasons" while voluminous outfits are not permitted because they "hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theater." While the sheer look was probably on its way out already, the no-big-trains rule, on the other hand‚Ä¶was not really followed to the letter. Another star of this year's festivities was Elle Fanning, who closed down the festival in a voluminous Cinderella gown by Chanel.</p>

          <h2>Expert Discusses the Importance of Emotionally Safe Parenting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert describes the concept of "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs and building resilience through open communication. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents focus on inner healing and self-awareness to create an environment where their child feels safe expressing their authentic self. Practicing this style involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame from taking place.</p>
