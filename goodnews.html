          <p>Shares of China's BYD experienced a decline following the company's announcement of price reductions on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June. The price cuts, including a 20% reduction on the Seagull hatchback, aim to boost sales amid growing competition in the electric vehicle sector. Analysts from Citi anticipate a significant increase in foot traffic at BYD's dealerships as a result of the price adjustments. While other Chinese automakers also saw share declines, Citi analysts remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.</p>

Weining Yu from the NBS noted the industrial sectors' resilience but cautioned about persistent challenges such as insufficient demand. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry increased by 9%, with improvements in biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, especially by SpaceX, scientists are investigating the complex sound waves and their impact on communities. They have found that Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and are now studying the noise from Starship, the largest rocket ever, which produces about 11 times the acoustic energy of a Falcon 9 launch. This research aims to inform regulations and reduce the impact of rocket noise on communities.</p>

The speech, written on the advice of the Canadian government, will likely convey a message that Canada is "not for sale" to the US.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was released from the hospital after receiving treatment for an inflammation of the inner ear, which caused vertigo. The 79-year-old president underwent imaging and blood tests, all of which returned normal results, and is now resting at the official presidential residence. This incident adds to Lula's history of medical issues, including a past fall, brain bleed, and cancer treatment. Lula, who is serving his third term as president, is expected to seek reelection next year.</p>
