          <p>This article reflects on Operation Babylift, a mission during the final days of the Vietnam War to evacuate children fathered by U.S. servicemen, highlighting both its humanitarian intent and ethical complexities. The operation, initiated by President Gerald Ford, aimed to rescue these children from potential harm, yet faced tragedy with the crash of its first flight. The article explores the mixed legacy of the mission, acknowledging criticisms regarding the evacuation of children without parental consent while also recognizing the opportunities it provided to many. The story of Thuy Williams, who was evacuated and later reunited with her mother, illustrates the complicated yet ultimately life-saving impact of the operation.</p>

          <p>A small marble sculpture, once believed to be a copy of Auguste Rodin's work, has been authenticated as a genuine piece by the famed French artist and sold for nearly $1 million at auction. The sculpture, titled "Despair," had disappeared after a 1906 auction, and its rediscovery brought delight to its owners, who had previously thought it was a mere replica. The Comite Rodin confirmed its authenticity after a six-week investigation, leading to its sale as an "extremely rare" find. The story highlights the potential for valuable art to be rediscovered and the importance of authentication in the art market.</p>

          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" that would kickstart "economic growth", while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said nuclear energy would "deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance". Critics, however, condemn the announcement, fearing the project will be a costly mistake and add to consumer bills. The investment is part of a series of announcements leading up to the government's Spending Review.</p>
