          <p>Jesse Armstrong, creator of Succession, is releasing his first feature-length film, Mountainhead, a satire about tech billionaires facing scrutiny amidst social unrest. Armstrong explains his continued focus on wealthy characters stems from an interest in power dynamics rather than just wealth. He emphasizes the film's rapid production to capture the anxieties surrounding technology, particularly AI, and the desire to reflect the fast-paced nature of societal fears. Armstrong also notes his directorial debut was made less daunting by the quick turnaround of the project.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a slight decline despite exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, attributed to artificial intelligence tailwinds. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33, and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts noted a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss as contributing factors to the stock's movement. The article highlights the complex factors influencing stock performance despite positive financial results.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares climbed after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and issued a stronger-than-expected forecast for the current quarter, driven by high demand for AI systems. Company officials attributed the strong guidance to $7 billion in artificial intelligence systems expected to ship during the quarter, which are higher-margin than other Dell systems. Dell expects about $103 billion in revenue for the full year, and it raised its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings to $9.40.

          <p>Germany's biggest opposition political party, the nationalist and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, has been designated "extremist" by the country's domestic intelligence agency. This allows the government to monitor party members to ensure they do not pose a threat to democracy, a move that has drawn criticism from some U.S. politicians. The German constitution, shaped by the United States, permits such measures to safeguard democracy. The article examines the constitutional framework allowing Germany to address perceived threats to its democratic values.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have declined again, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money right now. The average rate is 8.14%, lower than home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, making it attractive for homeowners with equity. Borrowing from home equity is not risk-free, and the variable rates of HELOCs mean that borrowers should consider volatility when budgeting. The article advises that it is helpful to know some timely considerations before securing the line of credit. (not investment advice)</p>
