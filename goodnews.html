          <p>Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, argues that the Democratic party's reliance on seniority is a downfall, advocating for more younger people to run for office and challenge incumbents. She emphasizes the importance of open conversations about retirement for older leaders and suggests that primaries are clarifying and provide practice for politicians. Litman's new book details how millennials and Gen Z leaders can remake their workplaces, advocating for separating work from personhood and bringing authentic selves to work. She believes that making workplaces better gives people back their time to be better citizens and engage in politics outside of work.</p>

Video footage showed Brigitte's hands on Emmanuel's face as he emerged from the plane, but Macron dismissed the incident as a joke between him and his wife. The president's office initially denied the authenticity of the images, but later confirmed them as genuine, blaming pro-Russian accounts for negative comments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior figures in British business report that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are being "rebranded" to avoid unwanted political attention. This shift comes amid a right-wing backlash against DEI efforts, with some organizations scaling back commitments and reducing public promotion of inclusion work. Despite this, experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act and legal risks. The trend reflects a broader effort to disguise DEI work while still addressing inequalities and promoting talent, particularly in US-headquartered firms.</p>

          <p>Five years after the anti-police protests sparked by George Floyd's death, initiatives to address officer mental health are gaining traction. Departments are creating wellness officer positions, peer support teams, and wellness rooms, along with providing mental health debriefings and training. These efforts aim to combat the high rates of depression, burnout, and PTSD among police officers, which have been exacerbated by job-related trauma and organizational stressors. The goal is to reduce stigma and encourage officers to seek help, ultimately saving lives and improving community interactions.</p>

          <p>The article explores a new way of thinking about the climate by recognizing the aliveness of nature and challenging the traditional separation between living beings and inanimate matter. It highlights the importance of understanding that things we have long been taught to think of as inert are springing into action, particularly as climate change superheats the planet. It emphasizes the need for new narratives that foreground nonhuman actors in order to slow this planetary cataclysm and examines the Rights of Nature movement, which seeks to grant basic rights to natural entities like rivers.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion in the United States, the country possesses several exceptional traits that protect it from the challenges of the Trump administration. These traits include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that resists rapid legal change, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a strong commitment to free speech. These features empower resistance and make it difficult for authoritarian actions to entrench, offering a bulwark against backsliding.</p>
