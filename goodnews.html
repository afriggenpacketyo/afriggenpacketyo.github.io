          <p>In a highly unusual move, Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Seranthony Dominguez was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the middle of a doubleheader between the two teams. After the deal was finalized, Dominguez was seen simply walking from the home clubhouse to the visiting one at Camden Yards to join his new team. He was available to pitch for the Orioles in the first game and then became eligible to play for the Blue Jays against his former teammates in the second. The trade sent prospect Juaron Watts-Brown to Baltimore in exchange for the right-handed reliever.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the United States and China concluded two days of negotiations described as "constructive," agreeing to continue working towards extending their 90-day tariff truce. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that any final decision on extending the truce, which is set to expire next month, rests with President Donald Trump. The talks aimed to prevent a return to the escalating tit-for-tat tariffs that marked the trade relationship earlier in the year. Key issues discussed included the trade deficit, technology, and China's export of critical minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sexual violence support charity in Brighton, UK, at the center of a legal dispute over trans inclusion, has announced it will launch a new support group exclusively for biological women. The decision comes after a woman sued the Survivors' Network, stating she felt uncomfortable in a support session attended by a trans woman. This new service will operate alongside the charity's existing groups, which remain open to trans and non-binary individuals. The resolution, reached before the case went to trial, aims to provide a dedicated space that some survivors feel is essential for their healing.</p>

          <p>In response to increasingly deadly heatwaves, the Phoenix Fire Department is successfully using a simple but highly effective technique to treat severe heatstroke: cold water immersion. When a person's core body temperature exceeds 104 degrees, first responders place them in a large plastic bag filled with ice and water to rapidly cool them down en route to the hospital. This method, adapted from military protocols, can cool patients three to five times faster than traditional techniques, significantly reducing the risk of brain damage and organ failure. The program's expansion has coincided with a drop in the city's heat-related deaths.</p>

          <p>According to former Mexican national team player Francisco 'Kikín' Fonseca, a strong performance in the Leagues Cup tournament presents a crucial opportunity for the LA Galaxy to mend its fractured relationship with its fanbase. The team is currently last in the MLS standings, and its supporters have been protesting the club's silence regarding federal immigration raids by refusing to chant during games. Fonseca believes that on-field success is the only way to reverse the situation, arguing that winning back the fans' trust and support is essential for the players' morale and the team's future.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a resolution to affirm support for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an independent panel of medical experts. The move comes amid reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering disbanding the committee. The USPSTF's evidence-based recommendations guide which preventive services, such as cancer screenings and supplements, are covered by most health insurers without co-pays. The resolution emphasizes the task force's critical role in public health and calls for its work to continue without political interference or disruption.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, the Los Angeles Zoo is now home to Tasmanian devils. Two males, named Danny Zuko and Crush, have arrived from a conservation organization in Australia and are now available for public viewing. As a species indigenous only to the island of Tasmania, they are known for having the strongest bite relative to their body size of any mammal. The arrival of these animals is significant as the species is classified as endangered, facing threats from disease and conflict with humans and other predators in their native habitat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency moves to repeal its foundational "endangerment finding" for greenhouse gases, California may be uniquely positioned to lead a resistance. Experts suggest that because many of California's own robust climate and clean air regulations predate the 2009 federal finding, the state has a strong legal and historical basis to continue its policies. Some analysts even argue that by ceding federal authority to regulate these emissions, the Trump administration could unintentionally open the door for California and other states to implement even stronger state-level climate rules.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has received a significant public response, including many ideas from young people, to its call for suggestions on a major redesign of the UK's banknotes. This is the first comprehensive rethink of the notes' themes in 50 years, potentially moving away from featuring notable historical figures. Some of the public's design ideas include natural landmarks like the Sycamore Gap tree, animals such as dolphins, and cultural icons like the Angel of the North sculpture. The bank is considering new themes like nature, innovation, and key historical events for the next series of currency.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government has announced a new plan to build up to 40,000 homes over the next ten years by redeveloping disused railway land. The initiative follows a "brownfield first" approach, aiming to transform former goods yards, industrial sites, and station properties into vibrant new communities with homes, shops, and green spaces. A new development company, Platform4, will be created to oversee the projects, which will begin in cities like Manchester and Newcastle. The government hopes the £1 billion plan will help address the country's housing shortage and attract private investment.</p>
