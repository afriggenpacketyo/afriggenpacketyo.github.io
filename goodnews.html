He highlights a potential "iPhone Air" with a slimmer design and Apple's first in-house modem chip as a key catalyst. Goldman Sachs also expressed bullish sentiment, forecasting increased iPhone revenues. This optimism follows Apple's $100 billion boost in US manufacturing investment, which helped mitigate tariff concerns and propelled the stock to its best monthly performance since May 2024.

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, raising it from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag starting in November. O'Leary stated the measure is intended to deter a small minority of passengers from violating bag size limits, emphasizing that the airline is not trying to "catch people out." He asserts that adhering to bag rules leads to faster boarding and fewer flight delays, with only 0.1% of passengers incurring extra charges for larger carry-on luggage.</p>
