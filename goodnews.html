          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a new record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., despite broader losses across other Asian markets. The index briefly touched an intraday high before stabilizing, while the small-cap Kosdaq saw a slight decline. This positive performance stood out against weaker trends in regions like Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia, which were influenced by U.S. banking sector fears and escalating trade tensions. The article also noted Chinese automaker BYD's stock fall due to a major vehicle recall, illustrating diverse market pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AC Milan's 17-year-old striker, Francesco Camarda, is generating significant buzz as a potential future star for Italy, having already broken several records in his precocious career. He became the youngest player to score a Serie A goal for Lecce and the youngest to debut for AC Milan and in the Champions League, where a goal was disallowed by VAR. Camarda, who has scored over 500 goals in youth football, recently netted a Panenka penalty on his Italy Under-21s debut, showcasing composure and ruthlessness. Despite high expectations, he remains focused on his development, with Milan securing him on a contract until 2028 to fend off interest from top European clubs.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney expressed skepticism regarding Marcus Rashford's recent claim that an "inconsistent environment" was responsible for his fluctuating performance at the club. Rashford, who scored 30 goals in the 2022-23 season but later fell out of favor and was loaned to Aston Villa, is now thriving at Barcelona. Rooney, while acknowledging environmental factors, suggested that a player's application and effort are ultimately their own responsibility. He argued that aspects like running more are unrelated to the environment, implying Rashford's explanation might be an "easy one to throw at people" rather than a true reflection of his own accountability.</p>

          <p>EU heads of state are pressing for swifter action on utilizing immobilized Russian assets, estimated at 175 billion euros ($204 billion), to finance Ukraine's military and defense efforts. This push comes amid increasing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for G-7 nations to seize these assets, a move beyond merely using generated profits. Concerns over potential financial and legal issues have slowed further measures, particularly from Belgium, which hosts the bulk of these funds. The EU Council seeks concrete proposals from the Commission and emphasizes fair burden-sharing and coordination with G7 partners to address Ukraine's pressing needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former members of the UK military can now apply for a digital version of their identity cards, a move expected to benefit approximately 1.8 million veterans. This digital ID, downloadable to smartphones, will facilitate easier access to public services like GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice, and various discounts. Ministers view this rollout as a "case study" for a planned wider scheme for all British citizens and residents, aiming to address privacy and security concerns. The article highlights this initiative as a step towards modernizing public services and streamlining access to vital support for veterans.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Max Scherzer delivered a vintage performance, and Andrés Giménez contributed a home run and four RBIs, as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 8-2 to tie the American League Championship Series at two games apiece. Scherzer, 41, became the oldest pitcher to start a postseason game since 2008, allowing just two runs over five and two-thirds innings, even exchanging words with his manager to stay in. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also hit his fifth postseason homer, while the Blue Jays offense continued its strong showing in Seattle, now heading into Game 5 with significant momentum.</p>

          <p>The first long-acting injection to prevent HIV, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with Scotland's policy. This injection, administered six times a year, offers an alternative to daily pills for HIV-negative individuals at high risk, aiming to enhance convenience and discretion. Experts hope this "game-changing" treatment will significantly contribute to the UK's goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations for whom oral PrEP is challenging.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court panel denied the Trump administration's request to lift an order blocking the president from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. The court also determined the administration was "unlikely to succeed" in proving a "rebellion" against the U.S. government or an inability to execute law with regular forces, despite Trump's claims of crime prevention in Chicago. The decision maintains the block on federalized Guardsmen within Illinois, asserting that "political opposition is not rebellion."</p>
