          <p>Nissan is contemplating sharing its global manufacturing plants with its Chinese partner, Dongfeng, as part of a broader restructuring effort. This comes as the company faces financial struggles, including significant job cuts and factory closures, due to weak sales in key markets. The potential collaboration aims to optimize production and navigate challenges in the competitive Chinese car market. Nissan recently reported an annual loss, further exacerbated by tariffs imposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics is exploring the possibility of providing an air taxi service for spectators through a partnership with Archer Aviation. The service would offer short flights between Olympic venues, potentially alleviating traffic congestion. Archer Aviation's Midnight aircraft, an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL), could transport up to four people. However, the plan is contingent on Archer receiving certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has yet to approve any eVTOL aircraft for commercial use. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses lived 17,000 years ago and were slightly larger than existing wild horses. The study highlights multiple migrations and genetic exchanges between the two continents between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. </p>
