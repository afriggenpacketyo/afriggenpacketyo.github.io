          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached the building on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction. Federal air traffic controllers also had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's location, leading to the aborted landings. The Army has paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety concerns after the incident, which added to unease following a deadly midair collision in January.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, blocking the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order infringed on the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The order, which instructed officials to review and revoke security clearances and terminate government contracts with the firm, was seen as retaliation for Jenner & Block's legal challenges against Trump's executive orders. The judge described parts of the order as a "screed" reflecting animosity towards the firm.</p>

          <p>A black-tie gala hosted by President Donald Trump for the biggest buyers of his meme coin was met with criticism regarding the quality of food and security. Attendees, who spent a combined $148 million on the token to attend, reported that the food was subpar and security was lax. Trump made a brief appearance, delivering a short address before departing without taking questions or pictures. Despite the opulent setting, some attendees were more focused on the coin's fluctuating price than the event itself.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students. This ruling came hours after Harvard filed a federal lawsuit challenging the administration's decision. The judge agreed to grant Harvard's request for immediate relief and set a hearing for May 29. Harvard argued that the government's action violates the First Amendment and would have a devastating effect on the university and its international students. The White House criticized the judge's ruling.</p>
