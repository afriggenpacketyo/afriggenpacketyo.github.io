          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 22:05:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City mayoral primary race is still uncertain even after polls closed, due to the city's ranked-choice voting system. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a slight lead with over 43% of first-choice votes, surpassing former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who garnered over 36%. Ranked-choice voting, first used in the mayoral primary in 2021, allows voters to rank up to five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed until a candidate surpasses the 50% threshold. The final outcome may take time, with ranked-choice tabulations not starting until July 1, allowing for mail-in ballots to be received. </p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park ensured the public was not at risk and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The bears were continuously monitored and successfully returned to their enclosure using recall training by the keepers. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error" as the cause. </p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC) reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is increasing, but further progress is needed to meet climate goals. The CCC emphasizes the importance of ensuring households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through lower energy bills. While greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen by over half since 1990, transport and buildings remain the largest emitters. Sales of electric heat pumps have grown significantly, but they remain expensive to install and operate due to high electricity costs, requiring government intervention to make electricity cheaper. </p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle (EV) charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding. </p>

Researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones.

The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. </p>
