          <p>Ruth Weiss, a celebrated Jewish journalist, writer, and human rights activist, has passed away at the age of 101. Having fled Nazi Germany for South Africa as a child, her experiences with persecution fueled a lifelong dedication to fighting against apartheid and racism. She became a renowned reporter, using her platform to expose the injustices of the apartheid regime and support African independence movements. Weiss, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005, is remembered as a moral authority whose work continues to inspire tolerance and humanity.</p>

          <p>The horror genre has experienced a major resurgence in 2025, with films like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners" driving the genre's domestic box office past $1 billion for the first time since 2017. This success is notable not only for its financial returns on typically low-budget productions but also for the critical acclaim these films are receiving, with some positioned as potential Oscar contenders. The article explores the trend of creators with comedy backgrounds, such as Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, finding success in horror, attributing it to the shared principles of timing and tension that underpin both genres.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of renters are reporting their monthly payments to credit bureaus as a strategy to build or enhance their credit history. According to a TransUnion survey, 13% of renters now use this method, which can significantly benefit those with thin or nonexistent credit files, often adding up to 60 points to their score. The article advises consumers to consider factors like service costs, which bureaus receive the data, and whether late payments are also reported before enrolling in a rent-reporting service. This trend is particularly popular among Gen Z and millennial renters.</p>

          <p>China is set to significantly expand its energy storage capabilities, aiming to almost double its current capacity to over 180 gigawatts by 2027. The government's new action plan involves an estimated investment of $35 billion, primarily focused on lithium-ion battery systems. This expansion is crucial for supporting the country's rapidly growing renewable energy sector and ensuring grid stability, especially during peak demand. The plan also includes promoting the development of alternative storage technologies like hydrogen, compressed air, and sodium-ion batteries to help China meet its carbon neutrality goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, which provides unconditional cash transfers to every pregnant woman, is demonstrating significant benefits for families and infants. The initiative gives expectant mothers $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 monthly for their baby's first year, aiming to combat child poverty. Recent studies show the program has lowered rates of maternal postpartum depression, stabilized housing, and improved infant health outcomes, saving millions in neonatal intensive care costs. Rx Kids is the first universal, community-wide cash transfer program of its kind in the U.S. and is now expanding to other Michigan communities.</p>

          <h2>New Zealand Mobilizes Community Volunteers to Eradicate Invasive Predators</h2>

          <p>New Zealand has launched an ambitious conservation project, Predator Free 2050, aiming to eliminate invasive species like possums, rats, and stoats that threaten its unique native bird populations. The nationwide effort relies heavily on community participation, with thousands of volunteers, including students and backyard trappers, setting traps to protect vulnerable birds like the flightless kiwi. Since their introduction by humans, these predators have driven 62 native bird species to extinction. While the goal is challenging, the program has spurred the development of new trapping technologies and fostered a strong sense of shared responsibility for conservation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global stock markets traded with mixed results on Monday as investors anticipated a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later in the week. European markets saw gains, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX rising, while Asian markets were varied, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng adding modestly and the Shanghai Composite edging down. Lingering concerns about China's economy, reflected in weaker-than-expected industrial production and retail sales data for August, contributed to the cautious sentiment. The market is closely watching the Fed, with expectations high for the first rate cut of the year.</p>

          <p>Charges have been dropped against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The Crown Prosecution Service determined that the evidence gathered did not meet the threshold for a trial, leading to not guilty verdicts for Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. The men had denied gathering information prejudicial to state security. Mr. Cash described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare" and expressed relief that justice was served, while the Chinese government had previously called the allegations "malicious slander."</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit, the U.S. and U.K. are set to sign significant deals to advance nuclear energy, aiming to create a "golden age" for the technology. The agreements include plans for advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool and powering AI data centers with small modular reactors. This cross-Atlantic partnership is intended to generate thousands of jobs, accelerate the development of new nuclear power stations, and attract billions in private investment. The collaboration reaffirms both nations' commitment to nuclear power as a low-carbon energy source to meet rising demand.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its nudity policies inconsistently, as other accounts with similar content remained active, and failed to provide a clear justification for the closure. In a significant decision, the court ordered Meta to review and adjust its terms of use to ensure users have clear mechanisms for challenging content moderation decisions. Gomez had argued the account closure affected her ability to work.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is launching a weeklong nationwide voter registration drive, focusing on battleground House districts and college campuses. The initiative, dubbed the "National Voter Registration Week of Action," aims to counteract a concerning trend of declining Democratic voter registrations and increasing Republican enrollment since 2020. This represents a strategic shift for the party, which has historically relied on outside groups for such efforts. The DNC plans to hold 50 events across 27 states and territories to build its organizational infrastructure ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation to prohibit employers from using credit checks to vet job applicants. The bill aims to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, arguing that denying employment based on financial history is discriminatory and makes little sense, as poor credit is often linked to medical debt or unemployment, not job performance. Proponents state the practice disproportionately affects people of color and women. If passed, the bill would stop employers from requiring credit history disclosure and prevent credit agencies from providing such reports for hiring purposes.</p>
