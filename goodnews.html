          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's earnings fell 17% from the prior year, a period which included a significant gain from Visa shares, but still beat expectations when accounting for this. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results while reiterating concerns about geopolitical risks and trade uncertainty. The positive report also led the bank to increase its guidance for net interest income for the full year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is voting on two significant cryptocurrency bills this week, aiming to establish a regulatory framework for the industry. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, has already passed the Senate, while the more comprehensive CLARITY Act, which defines regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC, faces a more uncertain path. Some Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over how the Trump family's involvement in crypto could create conflicts of interest. The crypto industry, including major players like Coinbase, is heavily lobbying for the bills' passage to bring regulatory certainty and encourage investment.</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, with both earnings and revenue beating estimates. The bank's performance was bolstered by a 16% year-over-year increase in markets revenue and an 18% rise in banking revenue. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as a positive sign for her ongoing turnaround plan for the company. However, the bank also reported a 16% growth in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook as a key factor for increasing its allowance for credit losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has granted Nvidia licenses to sell its advanced H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, according to CEO Jensen Huang. This decision reverses a previous restriction announced in April and comes after significant lobbying from Nvidia and other tech leaders. They argued that the export controls hindered U.S. competitiveness in a critical global market and could push other nations toward China's own AI technology. The move is seen as a major development in the ongoing tech and trade rivalry between the U.S. and China, with Washington seeking to balance economic interests with national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer, offered a surprisingly philosophical perspective on his career ahead of The Open championship. In a press conference, he questioned the ultimate point of his intense desire to win, noting that the joy of victory is often momentary before the pressure of the next event begins. Scheffler stated that golf is not a fulfilling life in the "deepest places of your heart" and emphasized that his family is his true priority. He asserted that he would quit professional golf if it ever negatively affected his relationship with his wife and son.</p>

          <p>With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon later this year, mortgage experts advise prospective homebuyers to prepare now to take advantage of a more favorable market. Key recommendations include conducting thorough research on the homebuying process, improving one's credit score, and paying down existing debt to secure better loan terms. Experts also note that while mortgage rates are influenced by the Federal Reserve, they are not directly tied, and the bond market plays a crucial role. They caution that a drop in rates could increase buyer competition, potentially driving up home prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has detected the largest black hole merger ever observed, resulting in the formation of a new black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The event, named GW231123, involved two large, rapidly spinning black holes that were themselves likely the product of previous mergers. Researchers noted that the size and extreme spin speed of the merging objects push the limits of current theoretical models of black hole formation. This discovery challenges existing understanding and is expected to open new avenues of research into the most extreme phenomena in the universe.</p>

          <p>In the current elevated interest rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) against more liquid money market accounts. This article analyzes the potential earnings of a $5,000 deposit in both, finding that top money market accounts currently offer slightly higher rates than even five-year CDs. However, the key difference lies in rate stability; CD rates are fixed for the term, guaranteeing the return, while money market rates are variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve lowers rates. The choice depends on prioritizing a guaranteed return or flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
