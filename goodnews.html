Inspired by an attempt to defraud her own grandfather, she created "Shield Seniors," a website and app designed to educate older adults on identifying and reporting online fraud. Manoj utilizes AI in her app to detect suspicious messages and has been teaching cybersecurity classes at senior community centers. She is currently seeking funding to launch the app widely by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, many Chinese export companies are now focusing on the burgeoning economies of Southeast Asia. A major trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a key testing ground for these firms to connect with buyers from the region. Companies, like an electric scooter manufacturer from Jiangxi, see immense potential in Southeast Asia's large population and growing consumer base. This strategic shift reflects a broader realignment in global trade dynamics as Chinese businesses seek new avenues for growth and expansion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing improper and political language in the complaint. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and resembled a "podium for a passionate oration at a political rally" rather than a professional legal document. The judge did not rule on the case's legal merits but gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile a shorter, more professional complaint. The New York Times welcomed the ruling, stating the original lawsuit was a political document intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St. James's Park in London. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, stated his intention is to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of the late monarch. The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will also feature a tribute to Prince Philip, is set to be revealed in 2026. Jennings plans to consult with the Royal Family and gauge public sentiment to create a fitting representation of Britain's longest-reigning sovereign.</p>

          <h2>Major US Tech Investments Spark Debate on Future of UK Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 19:03:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent influx of investment from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is fueling optimism about the UK's potential as an "AI superpower." During President Trump's state visit, deals worth billions were announced, focusing on AI infrastructure and research within the "Golden Triangle" of Oxford, Cambridge, and London. While proponents, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, see this as a path to economic growth, critics like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg warn that the UK is merely taking "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table." The trend suggests a deep alignment with the U.S. on tech policy, raising questions about whether the UK will become a tech laboratory for American giants or grow its own champion companies.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy has reflected on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," stating that playing the "psychopathic gangster" for nearly a quarter of his life has been a defining privilege. As he promotes his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" movie is coming to Netflix but kept plot details confidential to maintain the surprise for fans. He credits the show's massive success to its writing and its timing, and expressed gratitude for the rare opportunity to grow older with a character over six television series. The show's creator, Steven Knight, has written the script for the upcoming film.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 people have completed a 14-day, 160-mile march for democracy, arriving in Washington, D.C., after starting their journey in Philadelphia. The "We Are America" march was organized to build a movement to hold U.S. leaders accountable in response to actions by the Trump administration. Participants, ranging from children to the elderly, walked through multiple states, receiving support and lodging from local communities along the route. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children to symbolize their mission.</p>

          <p>"Pupusas and Punchlines," a weekly comedy show held at a Salvadoran restaurant in Los Angeles, is providing a vital platform for Latinx and other underrepresented comedians. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the event combines food and culture, allowing performers to connect with an appreciative audience over shared experiences. In a competitive L.A. scene where comics of color often struggle for bookings, the show has become a sold-out success, fostering a sense of community for both performers and attendees. Comedians feel they can address topics like immigration and first-generation life that might not resonate in more mainstream comedy clubs.</p>

Additionally, the market will be looking for further details from the recent meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping regarding a potential deal on TikTok.

          <p>The Canadian women's rugby team delivered a seismic upset in the World Cup semi-final, defeating the six-time champion New Zealand Black Ferns and ending their 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament. Canada, a team that had to fundraise to even attend the competition, dominated the first half and held on for a decisive victory. The result was hailed as a "fairytale" and a "tectonic" shift in the sport, as New Zealand had not lost a knockout game in the World Cup since 1991. Canada will now advance to the final at Twickenham, marking their first appearance since 2014.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding the future of TikTok in the United States, but a final agreement has not yet been reached, according to a White House official. Following their phone call, President Trump expressed optimism on social media, stating a deal was "well on its way" and that he had accepted an invitation to visit China early next year. However, a readout from Chinese state media was less definitive about an agreement. The popular video app's parent company, ByteDance, faces a December 16 deadline to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is proposing a new policy to establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, libraries, and shopping centers across England and Wales. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. They suggest the initiative could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they claim would save over £100 million. The "police desk promise" is a central announcement at the party's annual conference as they aim to appeal to voters concerned about community policing.</p>
