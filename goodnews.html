          <p>NASA has unveiled its 2025 astronaut class, comprising ten candidates selected from over 8,000 applicants for future missions to the ISS, the Moon, and Mars. The diverse group includes six women and four men with backgrounds in piloting, engineering, geology, and medicine. This marks the first NASA astronaut class with a female majority, reflecting a significant milestone for the agency. These candidates will now undergo two years of intensive training before becoming eligible for flight assignments amid an evolving and uncertain future for U.S. space exploration.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Rand Paul, has introduced the "America's CHILDREN Act" to offer a pathway to citizenship for long-term residents brought to the U.S. lawfully as children of visa-holding parents. The legislation aims to protect over 250,000 "Documented Dreamers" who risk "aging out" of their legal status at age 21 due to extensive backlogs in the immigration system. Supporters argue these individuals are culturally American and contribute significantly to the economy, and should not be penalized for systemic delays.</p>

Despite undergoing multiple operations, she still has depth perception issues, making her success remarkable. After helping Chelsea secure a domestic treble and leading England to a Euro 2025 victory with penalty shootout heroics, Hampton's journey is a testament to her resilience.

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, nearly a week after the show was suspended indefinitely. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, which prompted major broadcast station owners to threaten preemption. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense national situation, and the decision to bring the show back followed "thoughtful conversations" with the host. Kimmel is expected to address the controversy during his return broadcast.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture to address national security concerns. Under this framework, a majority of the company's investors, owners, and board members would be American, and software maker Oracle would oversee security, including the app's powerful algorithm. While a senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement has been reached. The plan aims to satisfy a U.S. law mandating that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, divest its American operations.</p>

Jackson called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages," highlighting its use of artificial intelligence to innovate in the industry and suggesting it is significantly undervalued compared to competitors. The recommendation triggered a massive rally, with the stock more than doubling at one point during the trading session. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their property have two primary options: a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While both are now more affordable, a HELOC currently offers slightly lower monthly payments due to its variable interest rate, which is initially lower than the fixed rate of a home equity loan. However, homeowners must weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term payment stability provided by a fixed-rate loan, considering their budget and risk tolerance for future rate changes.

          <p>A federal judge has overturned a stop-work order from the Trump administration, allowing Danish energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The Interior Department had ordered a halt to the project, which is 80% complete, as part of a broader effort to shut down the U.S. offshore wind industry. In granting a temporary injunction, Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit and would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy.</p>

The measure would require insurance companies to offer coverage to homeowners who implement wildfire mitigation measures or face a five-year ban on selling any home or auto insurance in the state. The proposal also aims to give policyholders more time to make necessary repairs for renewal.

Online maps from sources like Almanac estimate that northern areas will see peak colors by early October, followed by New England and the Pacific Northwest around mid-October. However, experts caution that these are just estimates, as the timing and vibrancy of the colors are influenced by local factors like temperature, rainfall, and elevation. Climate change is generally causing fall foliage to occur later than it has historically, but conditions each year can lead to variations.</p>
