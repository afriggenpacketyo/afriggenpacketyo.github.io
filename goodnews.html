          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national football team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. The former Chelsea manager described her transition to international football as "thoroughly enjoyable," comparing it to being a grandparent due to the shorter periods spent with players. Hayes, who led the US to an Olympic gold medal just three months into her tenure, noted that the role allows her to focus on long-term strategic thinking. She expressed satisfaction with the move from the high-frequency demands of club football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The women's football transfer record has been broken five times in 2025, with fees escalating dramatically and signaling significant financial growth in the sport. The latest record-setting move saw Grace Geyoro sign for London City Lionesses for approximately €1.6 million, highlighting the increasing investment, particularly from leagues in England and the United States. While experts see this as a positive sign for the sport's ecosystem, concerns are rising that the surge in transfer fees could widen the financial gap between elite clubs and the rest. This trend poses a challenge for leagues like Germany's Bundesliga, which struggle to compete with the broadcast and sponsorship revenues of their English and American counterparts.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Wednesday, showing a relatively muted reaction to the U.S. government shutdown that began overnight. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 continued its losing streak, while the central bank's Tankan survey revealed a slight increase in business optimism among large manufacturers. South Korea's Kospi and Taiwan's Weighted Index both recorded gains, with chipmaker TSMC rising after Nvidia's market cap surpassed $4.5 trillion. Meanwhile, spot gold prices reached a new record high, and markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a public holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

The White Ferns are entering the 50-over World Cup as the surprising reigning T20 World Cup champions, a title they won in 2024 despite being underdogs. Kerr stated that the team often uses its overlooked status to its advantage, allowing them to work quietly and perform without the pressure of being favorites. Despite some uninspiring recent form in the 50-over format, both Kerr and head coach Ben Sawyer believe the current squad is exciting and capable of defeating any opponent on their day.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 5.5%, a move that was in line with economists' expectations. The central bank is pausing to evaluate the economic impact of a significant 50-basis-point rate cut made in June. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted that while inflation moderated in the first quarter, global trade uncertainties could slow growth in the latter half of the financial year. The RBI projects the economy to grow by 6.8% in fiscal year 2026, though it has slightly lowered its forecasts for the third and fourth quarters due to trade-related headwinds.

          <p>James Slipper, the most-capped player in Australian rugby history, has announced his retirement from international duty following this weekend's Test match against New Zealand.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is upgrading its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) to a full secondary listing on a U.S. stock exchange, a move designed to attract a wider base of American investors. While the company has stressed that its primary listing, headquarters, and tax residency will remain in the U.K., the decision follows speculation about a potential full relocation. The move is seen by some as another blow to the London Stock Exchange, which has recently seen several major companies shift their primary listings elsewhere. AstraZeneca's decision aims to provide better access to the larger capital pools available in New York. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting Wednesday, retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products deemed unhealthy. The new restrictions, which apply to supermarkets and other large retailers, are part of a government effort to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. The measure had been delayed due to concerns about the cost-of-living crisis, but ministers and public health officials argue it is a crucial step. Public health advocates state that such promotions do not save consumers money and instead encourage impulsive and excessive purchasing of unhealthy items.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant infrastructure milestone, with its network of subsea energy pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers. The achievement was marked by the final installation of a deep-sea pipeline in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. State media reports that the network is planned to expand to over 13,000 kilometers by 2030, strengthening China's capacity to transport offshore resources and bolster its energy security. The pipelines are also designed to accommodate cleaner fuels like hydrogen and shale gas, supporting the nation's long-term energy transition goals.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte has navigated a complex geopolitical landscape, primarily defined by the need to manage the alliance's relationship with a re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump. Foreign policy experts generally grade his performance favorably, crediting him with securing a renewed U.S. commitment to the alliance and persuading members to increase defense spending. Rutte's diplomatic style, balancing flattery toward Trump with strategic lobbying among European allies, is seen as having bought Europe crucial time to bolster its own security capabilities. However, he now faces growing external pressures, including direct threats like Russian drone incursions, which will test his leadership further.</p>

          <p>As of today, all general practitioner practices in England must provide patients with the ability to book appointments online throughout the entire workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. The government-mandated change is designed to eliminate the "8am scramble," where patients overwhelm phone lines trying to secure an appointment. This new system allows patients to request non-urgent appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms online for a call back, freeing up phone lines for more urgent cases. Despite initial calls for a delay from the British Medical Association, ministers proceeded with the plan as a key step in modernizing the NHS.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series, displaying both their strengths and weaknesses. The offense was dominant, matching a franchise postseason record with five home runs, including two each from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered a superb seven-inning performance, keeping the Reds at bay for most of the night. However, the team's notoriously unreliable bullpen nearly allowed a comeback, giving up three runs in a tense eighth inning that highlighted the primary concern for the Dodgers as they advance in the playoffs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in the skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is driven by concerns over substantial student loan debt and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating white-collar, entry-level jobs. A recent survey found that over half of Gen Zers are worried about college debt, and 77% prioritize jobs that are difficult to automate. As a result, professions once seen as less desirable are gaining prestige, offering job security and strong earning potential without the financial burden of higher education.</p>
