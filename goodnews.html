          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, now suggests that many retirees can safely withdraw more. In a new book, he argues that a well-diversified portfolio allows for a starting withdrawal rate closer to 4.7%, and potentially as high as 5.5% for current retirees. Bengen emphasizes that his original rule was a conservative, worst-case scenario and that inflation remains the biggest threat to retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is shedding light on the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her era, surpassing even Rembrandt and Vermeer in fame during her lifetime. The daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, Ruysch had unique access to exotic flowers, which she depicted in intricate and vibrant still-life compositions. Despite the challenges faced by female artists, she achieved immense success, becoming a court painter and a member of the painters' guild in The Hague.</p>

          <p>In a sign of de-escalating tensions, North Korea has started to remove propaganda loudspeakers from its border with South Korea. The move follows a similar action by Seoul earlier in the week and is seen as a positive response to diplomatic overtures from South Korea's new president. For years, both nations have used massive speaker systems to broadcast messages, news, and music across the demilitarized zone. The broadcasts had been a significant source of noise and friction for residents living near the border.</p>

          <h2>American Malls Find New Life by Replacing Anchor Stores with Churches and Entertainment Venues</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new vitality by replacing closed anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants, including churches, entertainment complexes, and even hotels. This strategy is transforming malls into community hubs and driving a rebound in foot traffic. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people who then patronize other mall businesses. This trend of subdividing large spaces for niche tenants is helping malls generate significantly more revenue.</p>

          <p>After a high school football player experienced debilitating symptoms for months following a concussion, doctors discovered he had a rare brain condition. The New Jersey teen's persistent dizziness, headaches, and memory issues prompted a specialist to order an MRI, which revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels. The AVM, likely the true cause of his symptoms, was successfully removed via surgery, highlighting the importance of advanced testing for persistent post-concussion issues.</p>

Instead, they recommend creating a dedicated savings fund for entertainment expenses to avoid potential debt and financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a novel idea to make nuclear fusion more economically viable: manufacturing gold. The company's co-founder theorizes that neutrons produced during the fusion process could be used to transmute common metals into gold. While entirely speculative, the concept suggests that the millions of dollars generated from selling the precious metal could offset the high costs of developing fusion as a clean energy source. The idea revives the ancient dream of alchemy with a modern scientific foundation.</p>
