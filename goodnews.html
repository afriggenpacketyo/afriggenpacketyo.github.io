          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the initial nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government has presented this move as a "new dawn for rail," emphasizing service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment using profits, but refraining from promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about potential outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives insist Labour must fulfill its promises. SWR trains will now be managed by the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), with the new GBR livery already displayed on trains.</p>
