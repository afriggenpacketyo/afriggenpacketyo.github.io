          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a third victory against Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano, winning their final trilogy bout by a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The fight, described as more of a strategic "chess match" than their previous encounters, saw Taylor retain her undisputed light-welterweight championship. While Serrano had moments of success, Taylor's economical and smart boxing, particularly in the later rounds, proved decisive in front of the sold-out arena. Both fighters expressed mutual respect after the historic all-female card, with Taylor acknowledging Serrano as an "amazing warrior."</p>

          <p>Sedrick T. Stevenson, a fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by multiple law enforcement agencies to prevent another escape. Stevenson, who was wanted on multiple charges including firearm possession and assault, had been missing for over a month before U.S. Marshals apprehended him in Seattle. Officials noted the extensive coordination required for his secure transport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement involves licensing fees and compensation, but Google is not taking an equity stake in Windsurf, which remains an independent company. This move intensifies the ongoing "talent war" in the AI industry, where major tech firms are aggressively competing to hire top researchers and engineers. The deal follows reports that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, highlighting the high demand for its expertise in AI-assisted coding.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers, following a recent controversy. The company faced criticism for showcasing sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their origin. After a social media outcry and a call to action from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, Prada initiated talks for a potential collaboration. This move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting certain immigration enforcement tactics in several Southern California counties. The ruling, in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU, prohibits federal agents from conducting stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong stated there was a "mountain of evidence" that constitutional rights were being violated. The decision was praised by California officials, who argued the raids were based on racial profiling and were undermining community trust and safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices without permission to create and sell AI-generated voice clones after hiring them for what they were told were internal or academic projects. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on their voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to the AI's training data will proceed. The case is a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over the use of creative work.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing overseas offices to meet the growing demand from Chinese companies expanding internationally. These companies often prefer legal support from Chinese lawyers, whom they trust more. The number of Chinese legal offices abroad has grown significantly, reaching 209 by the end of last year, a 70% increase since 2018. This expansion is supported by a push from Beijing, as lawyers are seen as playing a crucial role in supporting the global ambitions of Chinese enterprises, though winning non-Chinese clients remains a challenge amid geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>With the patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, dozens of Chinese firms are developing generic versions. As many as 60 similar drugs are reportedly in trial, poised to enter a market valued at an estimated $150 billion. This influx of competition is expected to significantly lower the price of these treatments, making them more accessible to patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic players will compete for market share, driving down costs for consumers who currently face high monthly bills for the brand-name medication.

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in activity attributed to rising tariffs and global trade instability. The project will extend a quay and add 19 acres of new land, increasing cargo-handling capacity by 50% to accommodate larger ships. Port officials acknowledged the current period of uncertainty but expressed confidence in the need for long-term infrastructure investment to strengthen the American supply chain. The expansion comes as both the Port of Long Beach and the nearby Port of Los Angeles have seen a drop in container movement and exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"The Night We Met," a 2015 song by the indie band Lord Huron, has become an unlikely global hit, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. Initially an album track that flew under the radar, its popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and has since snowballed through its use in viral TikTok videos. The song's slow-burning success is a rare phenomenon for a track that was not a hit upon its release. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes its lasting appeal to its relatable, wistful lyrics that allow listeners to insert their own stories into the song.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted the inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to celebrate his long-held philosophy of living in harmony with the natural world. The event featured a fire ceremony led by an Earth Elder and focused on the interconnectedness of all life and the wisdom of pre-industrial cultures. The King's philosophy, detailed in his 2010 book, is described as a "call to revolution" against consumer culture and a plea for sustainable practices. The summit aims to translate these ideas into practical action, connecting his environmental, cultural, and spiritual interests.</p>
