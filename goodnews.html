          <p>Ed, a pet zebra who had been on the loose in Tennessee for over a week, has been safely captured, bringing an end to his internet-famous adventure. The Rutherford County Sheriff‚Äôs Office confirmed that Ed was located in a pasture near a subdivision in Christiana and was airlifted back to a waiting animal trailer. Ed's owner, Laura Ford, expressed relief that the zebra was unharmed after his escape, which began on May 30. Ed's escapades included running along Interstate 24, prompting deputies to shut down the roadway, and numerous sightings that were widely shared on social media.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision, penned by Justice Jackson, has reignited the debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) policies, particularly concerning the extent to which the law should treat individuals as members of a group rather than as individuals. The case, *Ames v. Ohio*, involved a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against based on her sexual orientation when she was denied a promotion and later demoted. The court unanimously decided in favor of Ames, reinforcing the principle that discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The decision underscores the complexities of balancing individual rights with efforts to address historical and systemic discrimination.</p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham, brother of Jude Bellingham, is following a similar path by joining Dortmund, but is determined to establish his own identity in football. Former Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray emphasized that Jobe wants to be recognized for his own abilities, rather than living in his brother's shadow. While Jude is known for his attacking midfield role, Jobe is versatile and can play as a defensive or box-to-box midfielder. He played 43 times for Sunderland in the 2024-25 season, scoring four goals and registering three assists. Former Sunderland striker Marco Gabbiadini believes that the move to Germany will be positive for Jobe's development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, conflicts often arise from a few key areas, revealing underlying issues within the relationship. Tone of voice or attitude is the most common cause, signaling contempt, a strong predictor of divorce; addressing it requires resisting retaliation and naming the effect. Family relations often reflect unmet needs and misalignments, particularly when one partner feels unsupported; reassurance and establishing limits as a team are crucial. Uneven distribution of household chores leads to arguments, stemming from the unrecognized "invisible load"; naming the load and redistributing tasks can alleviate this. Communication styles can derail conversations, with defensiveness and criticism escalating conflicts; implementing a "five-second rule" for time-outs helps de-escalate tension.</p>

However, the MLSPA argues that this payout is "below the international standard" and accuses the league of attempting to "strong-arm" players into CBA waivers.

Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the "addictive nature of some of the apps and smartphones." Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, whose daughter took her own life after viewing harmful content, criticized the government's delayed action on online safety laws. Curfews and screen time limits are already available through Apple and Google's parental controls, and TikTok introduced a 60-minute default limit for users under 18 in 2023.</p>
