          <p>Johns Hopkins professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses China's complex economic and political landscape, framing its current challenges as a "polycrisis" that could be transformed into a "polytunity." In an exclusive interview, she reflects on the historical depth of U.S.-China engagement, noting a decline in American expertise on China. Ang emphasizes the legacy of figures like Michel Oksenberg, who pioneered deep, nuanced understanding between the two nations. She suggests that adaptive strategies are crucial for China to navigate its developmental path in an unpredictable world.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 17:53:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"The Fantastic Four: First Steps" has achieved a successful opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million in North America and a global total of $218 million. This marks the fourth-largest domestic debut of the year and a significant success for Marvel, suggesting that audience appetite for superhero films remains strong when the movies are well-received. The film, set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, stars Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby and represents a successful reboot for the franchise under Disney's supervision. The strong performance helps boost the North American box office, which is currently running 12% ahead of last year.</p>

          <p>Several members of the USA Swimming team are recovering from acute gastroenteritis while competing at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. The team's medical staff is treating affected athletes and implementing preventative measures, though the source of the illness is unknown.

Despite the circumstances, the team has shown resilience, with both the men's and women's 4x100m freestyle relay teams securing medals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most European goods, including cars. The deal, announced by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, averts a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments in the U.S. While some European leaders expressed relief, others noted the new tariffs would still make trade more challenging.

Policymakers are already implementing green initiatives, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. The author contends that building a low-carbon tourism corridor requires more than just hardware; it needs supportive systems and partnerships. By emulating Shenzhen's coordinated policy and government-industry collaboration, the region can cater to the evolving priorities of environmentally conscious travelers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss the new U.S.-EU trade deal and the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Starmer is expected to push for a reduction in remaining U.S. tariffs on UK goods, building on a previous bilateral agreement. The talks highlight the delicate diplomatic balance the UK must maintain between its U.S. and European allies, particularly regarding Middle East policy. The meeting occurs as the UK government faces internal pressure to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move the U.S. has dismissed.</p>

          <p>The last-minute trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union provides a political victory for both President Trump and Commission President von der Leyen. The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff rate, avoids the threatened 30% and is presented as a landmark moment in rebalancing the major trade relationship. For the U.S., it secures significant new EU investment and tariff revenue, while the EU avoids a more damaging trade war. This analysis notes that the deal's success now strengthens the U.S. position ahead of separate, more challenging trade negotiations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

While on stage, her gold sequined skirt unexpectedly fell to the floor, revealing her matching underwear. Lopez handled the moment with humor, exclaiming, "I'm out here in my underwear," before a dancer tried to assist and she threw the broken garment to the crowd. She later joked that she was glad she had worn underwear for the show. The incident occurred during her first concert tour in six years.</p>

          <p>Divya Tyagi, an undergraduate engineering student at Penn State, has solved a 100-year-old aerodynamics puzzle, creating a refined model for wind turbine design. Her work provides an addendum to a 1935 theory by Hermann Glauert, accounting for real-world forces like wind pressure and blade bending that the original model overlooked. Tyagi's solution uses calculus of variations to calculate optimal thrust and performance, which could lead to more durable and efficient turbines. Experts believe even a 1% improvement in power coefficient from her work could have a significant impact on energy production from large wind farms.</p>

While Hall H still featured major events, including an appearance by George Lucas, many fans emphasized that the convention's appeal extends beyond a single room.
