          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the airport's own long-standing plan. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex task of diverting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would be cheaper, reduce risk, and could be operational by 2035, costing under £25 billion. This development introduces the first-ever competitive bidding process for the airport's expansion, a project that has faced numerous delays due to costs, legal challenges, and the pandemic.</p>

However, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung indicated the funds would facilitate Korean companies' entry into U.S. markets. The deal also includes a commitment from Seoul to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products, while U.S. goods will not face any tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The company saw significant growth in funded customers, total platform assets, and subscribers to its premium Gold service, reflecting its successful push into broader wealth management. While trading revenue from options was strong, crypto and equities trading were slightly below forecasts. Despite the positive report, shares dipped after the company projected higher operating costs for 2025 due to its acquisition of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. (not investment advice)</p>

The strong results were driven by robust growth in advertising impressions and price, as well as a 6% increase in daily active users across its Family of Apps. The company also provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that surpassed analyst predictions. Despite raising its full-year expense outlook to fund its aggressive push into artificial intelligence, investors reacted positively, sending the stock soaring in after-hours trading.

          <p>A research team has captured unprecedented images of vibrant and dense communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast beds of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that these "chemosynthetic" communities are more widespread than previously thought, opening new avenues for understanding how life adapts to immense pressure and total darkness.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has confirmed that the company's massive spending on artificial intelligence will continue through 2025 and is expected to grow at an even faster rate in 2026. This strategy is part of a competitive push against other tech giants also investing heavily in AI. The company raised its expense outlook for the current year, citing the need to build a top-tier AI talent team and a leading computational infrastructure. Zuckerberg stated that these investments are already improving ad system efficiency and user engagement across platforms like Facebook and Instagram, justifying the significant costs.

          <p>A growing number of scientists are challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains, arguing that the scientific evidence is often flawed and inconclusive. The article explores the debate, noting that much research relies on unreliable self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies suggest links to mental health issues or sleep disruption, others find little to no correlation. This scientific uncertainty has led to inconsistent advice for parents, fueling a debate over whether current fears are driving policy that could be misguided or even counterproductive.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 quake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula caused surprisingly little widespread tsunami damage. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this fortunate outcome. While the sparsely populated area near the epicenter saw significant waves, the main energy of the tsunami was directed into the open Pacific, largely between Alaska and Hawaii. This allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines like the U.S. West Coast, where wave heights were minimal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the era of "comfort TV" may be waning, as audiences and critics increasingly embrace shows that induce anxiety and reflect real-world stress. Series like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" utilize high-pressure scenarios and hyperrealistic filmmaking to create a visceral tension that resonates with viewers. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be satisfying, as it allows audiences to experience a fight-or-flight response without any actual risk. The trend may also reflect a desire for more grounded, sincere storytelling that acknowledges the mundane, high-stakes challenges of modern work and life, particularly among younger audiences.</p>
