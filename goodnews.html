          <p>Hawaii's Senate has passed a bill to increase the tourist tax on hotels, aiming to generate funds for climate change mitigation and resiliency projects. Senate Bill 1396 would raise the hotel tax to 11% starting in January, increasing to 12% the following year, with revenue allocated to the "Climate Mitigation and Resiliency Special Fund" and the "Economic Development and Revitalization Special Fund". The bill aims to invest in actions to prepare for, mitigate, and adapt to climate change, including resilience to natural disasters. The bill is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Josh Green.</p>

          <p>New York City has ended its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which since 1997, purchased over 1,800 properties to protect the city's drinking water supply. The city spent $518 million to acquire 156,350 acres to keep waste out of the watersheds, allowing the city to avoid filtration. The decision to halt the program came after an independent review concluded further land purchases would be of little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring Catskill townships to approve any land transactions.</p>

          <p>France's former interior minister, G√©rald Darmanin, has apologized to Liverpool fans for wrongly blaming them for the chaos at the 2022 Champions League final at the Stade de France. Darmanin admitted that security arrangements were inadequate and that his initial remarks were a mistake, acknowledging that the real problem stemmed from delinquents robbing fans. Police had used tear gas on Liverpool supporters, and some fans were mugged by gangs of French youths. Darmanin, now France's justice minister, called the night "the biggest failure" of his career.</p>

          <p>The Eta Aquariid meteor shower, created by debris from Halley's Comet, is set to peak tonight.

The shower will be viewable in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with better conditions in the Southern Hemisphere.
