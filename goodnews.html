          <p>Germany's Defense Minister plans to order an additional 15 F-35 fighter jets from U.S. manufacturer Lockheed Martin, on top of the 35 already requested. This move is part of Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget in response to the perceived threat of Russian aggression, with the jets intended to replace the country's aging Tornado fleet. In a separate development, the far-right AfD party has proposed making U.S. President Donald Trump an honorary citizen of the district where his grandparents were born, citing his role in the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to roll out new vocational courses called V-levels for 16-year-olds in England, aiming to simplify a "confusing landscape" of qualifications. These new courses are set to replace Level 3 BTecs and other existing post-16 technical qualifications. As part of the educational reforms, ministers also intend to introduce an alternative qualification to reduce the number of teenagers who have to resit their maths and English GCSE exams, addressing what has been described as a demoralizing process for many students.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is in advanced talks to hire former Everton and Burnley manager Sean Dyche as its new head coach. The move comes after the swift sacking of Ange Postecoglou, whose tenure was the shortest in Premier League history. Dyche has emerged as the leading candidate to take over the struggling club, which currently sits 18th in the table, with the hope that an agreement can be finalized on Monday to help steer the team away from relegation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his coaching adaptability in a decisive 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium. With his top receiver, Puka Nacua, sidelined by injury, McVay pivoted from his team's usual offensive scheme. He heavily utilized a formation with three tight ends, a significant departure from his typical preference for three-receiver sets, which proved highly effective and led to five touchdown passes from quarterback Matthew Stafford.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech firm Akeso saw its shares gain after presenting highly positive trial data for its cancer drug, ivonescimab, at a major European oncology symposium. The data, also published in The Lancet, highlighted the drug's clear advantages, including lower toxicity and zero patient discontinuation, suggesting a more potent and longer-lasting anti-tumor response. Analysts noted that this positions ivonescimab as a leading asset in its class, potentially two to three years ahead of its competitors in the PD-1/VEGF combination therapy space.
