          <p>The price of gold reached $3,651.88 per ounce as of September 12, 2025, continuing its role as a significant investment commodity, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. This article explores the various factors that influence the precious metal's fluctuating value, including fundamental principles of supply and demand, and broader global economic conditions. Key drivers discussed are inflation rates, to which gold often serves as a hedge, and geopolitical instability, which can drive investors toward safe-haven assets. Central bank policies and shifts in currency strength, especially the U.S. dollar, also play a crucial role in determining its market price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the closure of 93 locations, Red Lobster is attempting a significant brand revitalization by focusing on nostalgia and affordable pricing. The seafood chain has launched an advertising campaign featuring *NSYNC member Joey Fatone and reintroduced classic menu items like popcorn shrimp to appeal to customers' fond memories. To attract diners, the restaurant has also introduced new value-oriented deals, such as $20 lobster rolls and special shrimp offers, replacing a previous promotion that resulted in an $11 million loss. Branding experts suggest this strategy taps into a powerful emotional connection with consumers, blending retro appeal with modern relevance.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling 35 shares of Broadcom (AVGO) to rebalance its portfolio after the stock experienced significant outperformance, gaining about 55% this year. The move is described as a disciplinary measure to right-size the position, which had become the largest in the portfolio, rather than a change in belief about the company's prospects in the AI sector. The stock has surged approximately 17% since its last earnings report, where it revealed a new mystery customer for its custom AI chips, rumored to be OpenAI. This sale will realize an 88% gain on shares purchased in September 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City secured a decisive 3-0 victory over Manchester United by tactically exploiting weaknesses in United's defensive system. City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever positioning to create a midfield overload and disrupt United's pressing scheme. Players like Jérémy Doku moved into central positions, forcing United's defenders into difficult decisions and leaving key City attackers unmarked. This tactical analysis highlights how City's strategic use of 'pinning' defenders and creating numerical advantages in midfield were crucial in breaking down United's defense, leading to a comfortable win in the derby.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant jump in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since February 2020. Musk acquired approximately 2.57 million shares for about $1 billion, a move widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's future. This purchase is his largest ever by value and comes as Tesla's stock has faced pressure from slumping sales and increased competition. The move is seen by analysts as Musk doubling down on his vision for Tesla's transformation into an AI and robotics-focused company.</p>

          <p>High-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have resulted in a framework for a deal concerning the social media platform TikTok, according to U.S. officials. President Donald Trump announced that the talks in Madrid concluded successfully and hinted at a resolution for a "certain company," which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later confirmed was TikTok. The wildly popular app, owned by China's ByteDance, has faced a potential ban in the U.S. over national security and data privacy concerns. President Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday to finalize the details of the agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from reporting their earnings every quarter to every six months. In a post on Truth Social, he argued that this change, which would require SEC approval, would save money and encourage a more long-term management focus, contrasting it with China's long-range view. This proposal aligns with practices in the UK and European Union, where semi-annual reporting is standard. The idea of reducing the frequency of corporate reporting has been previously supported by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who argued against quarterly guidance to foster long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Africa is becoming increasingly vital in the global supply of critical minerals, which are essential for technologies driving the green energy transition. The continent is a leading producer of cobalt, platinum, and manganese, and this sector could boost sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years. However, significant challenges remain, including ensuring that revenues are shared equitably and that environmental standards are upheld by mining companies. According to UN Trade and Development, African nations are currently generating only about 40% of the potential revenue from mineral extraction, highlighting the need for better governance and value-chain development.</p>

These introduced mammals have driven numerous native bird species to extinction and continue to threaten the survival of iconic birds like the kiwi.
