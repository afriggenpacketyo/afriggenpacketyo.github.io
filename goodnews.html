          <p>Shares for SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following the company's announcement of fiscal first-quarter profits that significantly surpassed expectations. The Japanese investment giant reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, far exceeding the 127.6 billion yen forecast, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. This growth was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021, attributed to successful investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of SoftBank's portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also preparing for initial public offerings, which further boosts investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen parents. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman certified a class action covering all children affected by the order, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to win their case on the grounds that the policy violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling ensures the policy remains on hold as legal challenges continue to proceed through the courts.</p>

The dismissal followed controversial social media posts where she compared the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The terms of the settlement, which was financially supported by Elon Musk, were not disclosed. In a statement, Carano expressed hope for healing, while Lucasfilm praised her as a respected professional and stated it looks forward to potential future collaborations, a notable shift from its previous condemnation.</p>

          <h2>Southern Small White Butterfly Seen in the UK for the First Time</h2>

          <p>A butterfly species native to Southern Europe, the Southern Small White, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. The sighting occurred at Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk, where a volunteer photographed the female butterfly. Experts have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe, which has seen it move at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year over the last decade. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, it is uncertain if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK due to its specific food source requirements.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people are abandoning dating apps in favor of old-fashioned, in-person singles events, seeking more genuine connections. Organizers of events like Date Cincy report a surge in attendance, particularly among millennials who were early adopters of app-based dating but are now experiencing fatigue. Data shows that dating app usage is declining among younger generations, while attendance at singles events has risen significantly. Participants and organizers cite the benefits of face-to-face interaction, which allows for immediate chemistry and avoids the misrepresentation common in online profiles, leading to more authentic relationships.</p>

          <p>Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko capped a remarkable week by winning her first WTA Tour title at the National Bank Open in Montreal. The 18-year-old, ranked 85th, defeated former world number one Naomi Osaka in a three-set final, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1. After a difficult first set, Mboko rallied to deny Osaka her first title in four years. Her victory, which followed wins over three Grand Slam champions earlier in the tournament, will propel her to a new career-high ranking of 34. The final was Osaka's best performance since returning from maternity leave.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, successfully promoted weight loss in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with efficacy comparable to injectable drugs like Zepbound. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, causing about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible pill-based treatment available by 2026.</p>

          <h2>Texas Roadhouse Reports Strong Sales Growth but Faces Pressure from High Beef Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 19:41:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with strong sales growth offset by profitability challenges due to rising beef costs. The restaurant chain saw a 12.8% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.51 billion, beating estimates, driven by a notable increase in customer traffic. However, earnings per share missed expectations as high beef prices squeezed margins, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter. To counteract this, the company plans a modest 1.7% menu price increase, aiming to balance affordability with inflationary pressures while maintaining its strong consumer appeal.
