          <p>Terron Armstead, a four-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman, has retired from the NFL after 12 years due to the debilitating effects of injuries sustained throughout his career. Armstead revealed that a persistent knee issue, which he had been dealing with since his third year in the league, severely limited his ability to walk, often requiring pain medication to play. He explained that he was unable to practice and could not walk without assistance until several days after each game. Armstead expressed gratitude and peace with his decision, emphasizing his full investment in maximizing his God-given abilities. The Saints drafted Armstead in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. The sentiment of the article is one of respect for the sacrifices made by athletes. </p>

          <p>The Major League Soccer Players Association (MLSPA) has criticized MLS's proposal for distributing Club World Cup prize money, deeming the 20% payout "below the international standard."

The MLSPA noted the league's attempts to "strong-arm" players into CBA waivers unrelated to the Club World Cup. The Seattle Sounders previously protested the prize money structure, with the MLSPA stating the league failed to offer a reasonable proposal. Negotiations continue as the Club World Cup approaches.
