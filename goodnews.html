          <p>China has significantly increased its offshore wind capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. This rapid expansion is part of a national strategy to advance the country's marine economy, supported by strong government subsidies and planning. A recently operational project, located 85.5km offshore, is expected to power over a million households annually. This push in renewable energy is highlighted by President Xi Jinping as a key sector for high-quality development, energy security, and job creation in coastal provinces.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the nearly two-decade-old requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at TSA security checkpoints in all U.S. airports. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that advances in technology and layered security measures, including new scanners and the REAL ID requirement, make the policy change possible while maintaining safety. While the mandate is lifted for general screening, some individuals may still be asked to remove their shoes for additional screening. The move is intended to streamline the travel process, though officials note that TSA PreCheck will remain valuable for bypassing other screening steps.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin as the director of its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran in the field with two decades of experience, will lead the agency with a $375,000 annual salary. The new department was created to provide more direct accountability over homelessness spending, moving funds and responsibilities away from the criticized Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). Mahin currently directs the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new agency's approach to integrating housing with medical and support services.</p>

          <p>João Pedro made a sensational full debut for Chelsea, scoring two impressive goals against his former club Fluminense in the Club World Cup semi-final. The performance has sparked suggestions that the Brazilian forward, recently signed from Brighton, could be the answer to the club's long-standing issues in the number nine position. His ability to score, link up play, and contribute across the pitch was praised by analysts. As one of 19 forwards signed under the club's current ownership, his immediate impact positions him as a strong contender for a regular starting role, potentially ahead of other expensive attacking acquisitions.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer endorsed online used car retailer Carvana, advising investors that he is a "true believer" in the company for the long term. He noted the stock's recent strong performance and its potential to reach new all-time highs, despite its volatility. Cramer praised Carvana's convenient online business model, which he believes gives it room to gain market share in the fragmented auto sales industry. He also suggested the company could benefit from potential interest rate cuts and new tariffs on foreign automakers, which may make used cars more attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific coast. The proposed 4,500-kilometer (2,800-mile) corridor would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the port of Chancay in Peru, potentially shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days. The project, with cost estimates exceeding $70 billion, aims to reshape South American trade routes. The current agreement is for technical, environmental, and economic studies, which are expected to take up to five years to complete.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check: Does President Trump's New Bill Eliminate Taxes on Social Security?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 18:01:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax and spending package signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below a certain threshold. While this will provide tax relief for some seniors, policy experts note it does not change the fundamental way Social Security benefits are taxed. The deduction will primarily benefit higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax will see no change.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares of Amazon stock, valued at approximately $665.8 million, over two days in early July. The transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan, announced earlier this year, which allows for the sale of up to 25 million shares through May 2026. This recent sale follows a similar divestment of over $736 million in stock at the end of June. Despite these sales, Bezos remains Amazon's largest shareholder, holding over 900 million shares valued at nearly $200 billion.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, resting 675 meters deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the ship's crew heroically managed to keep it afloat and sail for repairs, an incredible feat of damage control. The discovery was made during seafloor mapping operations and positively identified through distinctive details, offering a poignant reminder of the crew's sacrifice during World War II.</p>
