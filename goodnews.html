        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the idea that happiness stems from contentment rather than the accumulation of wealth, drawing lessons from the author's new book. It argues that appreciating the ordinary, managing expectations, and recognizing that psychological wealth is more valuable than material possessions are key to a fulfilling life. The author contrasts billionaires with his grandmother-in-law, who lived near poverty but was exceptionally happy because she wanted less than she had. The central message is that true richness is achieved when one can say "this is enough," regardless of their financial status.</p>

          <p>The New York Stock Exchange's parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has invested $2 billion in the prediction markets platform Polymarket, causing ICE's shares to rise. This deal values Polymarket at approximately $8 billion and signals a growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets, which are seen as a competitor to the sports gambling industry. Polymarket, which recently received approval to launch in the U.S., aims to combine its consumer-focused approach with ICE's institutional scale. The investment highlights the potential for significant growth in the prediction markets sector over the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The move is part of a U.S. initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc, which are vital for energy, defense, and manufacturing. This partnership reverses a previous administration's decision and grants permits for the Ambler mining district project in Alaska. The project remains controversial, with opponents citing potential harm to local ecosystems and communities. (not investment advice)</p>

She highlighted that WNBA salaries are often low enough that earning more through other ventures is relatively easy. Her comments come amidst a broader conversation about player compensation in the league, amplified by the attention brought by rookies like Caitlin Clark, whose endorsement deals far exceed their league salary. Cambage advised players interested in similar paths to remain authentic to their personalities while capitalizing on new opportunities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the S&P 500 continuing to set record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to look beyond the popular index for better diversification and protection against a potential pullback. They argue that the market-cap-weighted index is heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, creating an "illusion of safety" and increasing volatility risk. To mitigate this, advisors suggest considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. The goal is to build a more balanced portfolio that can perform well even during periods when the large-cap index underperforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Surge in Private Capital Allows Startups to Delay Public Offerings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:14:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startups are remaining private for longer periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely attributed to the massive growth of alternative capital sources like venture capital, private equity, and sovereign wealth funds, which provide ample funding without the regulatory burdens of being a public company. As a result, companies are more mature and have significantly higher revenues by the time they launch an IPO. While this allows early-stage investors to capture more growth, some analysts question if the flood of private capital will diminish future returns.</p>

          <p>Residents across the United Kingdom have been reporting an unusual number of ladybirds swarming in their homes, a phenomenon attributed to recent warm weather. After a cool start to October, a spike in temperatures prompted the insects to seek sheltered spots to enter diapause, their form of winter hibernation. Experts note that while the number of sightings is normal for this time of year, the invasive harlequin ladybird is most likely to be found indoors. A warm spring and summer led to a boom in aphid populations, the ladybirds' primary food source, which in turn caused their numbers to surge.</p>

This comes as Tesla's auto sales have been in a slump, partly due to an aging lineup and increased competition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, many people compare their current marginal tax rate to their expected future rate, but one financial planner argues this is a mistake. He suggests that savers should instead consider their effective tax rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of total income—which is often much lower than the marginal rate. Because of how progressive tax brackets and deductions work, one's effective tax rate in retirement may be significantly lower than anticipated. This calculation could make pretax contributions more advantageous than commonly thought, allowing for tax planning opportunities like Roth conversions later. (not investment advice)</p>

While the overall number of homes sold was lower than the previous year, the proportion bought by investors increased. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, accounting for over 90% of investor-owned homes. In contrast, large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters, often shifting capital towards build-to-rent communities, which adds to the rental supply and reduces competition for traditional homebuyers.

This "retail revolution" is shifting the private market landscape, which has historically been dominated by institutional investors. Ares has been a key beneficiary, with over $50 billion in assets from retail-focused vehicles, and CEO Michael Arougheti pushes back on the narrative that weaker deals are funneled to this segment. He argues that the move into private markets is a natural evolution for investors seeking diversification away from the increasingly concentrated public markets. (not investment advice)</p>
