          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:27:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of existing overseas workers. The government also intends to raise the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and introduce stricter training requirements for unemployed individuals. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the plans as insufficient and called for an annual migration cap.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of Doomsday Preppers in America Reflects a Culture of Self-Reliance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals that nearly half of Americans engage in some form of preparedness for adverse events, reflecting a deep-seated cultural value of self-reliance. This trend is driven by a combination of factors, including historical narratives of frontier self-sufficiency and contemporary anxieties about extreme weather events and inadequate government responses. While the ultra-rich may invest in extravagant bunkers, prepping is also a significant phenomenon among the middle class, with shelf-stable food and home fallout shelter kits gaining popularity. The growing interest in doomsday prepping underscores a broader question about the balance between individual responsibility and collective action in confronting societal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with the challenges of parenthood and a lack of structural support for families in the US, some parents are intentionally building communities with friends to share the responsibilities and joys of raising children. This involves living near or even with friends, creating a network of support that resembles an extended family. While such arrangements require coordination and compromise, they offer parents much-needed assistance and deeper friendships. These alternative family structures provide a model for how chosen connections can enrich and sustain family life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a developing trade agreement with the Trump administration. While the initial document outlining the "economic prosperity deal" did not explicitly mention the exemption, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated that the aerospace industry would have a "specific guarantee of zero tariffs." The agreement aims to provide certainty to the ¬£40bn sector, which supports 450,000 jobs in the UK, and would also benefit US companies like Boeing, which import Rolls-Royce engines.</p>

          <p>Baidu, a Chinese tech company, is developing an AI-based translation system to decode animal sounds, including cat meows, with the goal of enhancing human-pet communication. The system, currently in the research phase, aims to foster deeper emotional connections and improve interspecies understanding. Baidu joins other organizations like Earth Species Project and NatureLM, which are also using AI to decipher animal communication, including birdsong and dolphin whistles. While a direct animal translation tool remains years away, scientists have reported early successes in conversing with animals like humpback whales.</p>
