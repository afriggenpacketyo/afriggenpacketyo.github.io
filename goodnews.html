          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold 100,000 shares of Nvidia stock, amounting to approximately $15 million based on Tuesday's opening price. This transaction marks the first sale under Huang's plan, announced in March, to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of 2025, potentially worth $873 million. Despite this sale, Huang still holds over 800 million Nvidia shares and maintains a net worth of around $126 billion, securing his position as the 12th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Nvidia's stock has seen tremendous growth, increasing by over 800% since December 2022, driven by high demand for its GPUs in the artificial intelligence sector. The company continues to expand, although it faces export control challenges that could impact its international markets.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of books to train its AI model, Claude, constitutes "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that the large language models (LLMs) did not reproduce creative elements or identifiable expressive styles from the copyrighted works. This decision is considered a significant win for AI companies involved in legal battles over the use of copyrighted material for training LLMs. The ruling helps to establish legal boundaries and opportunities for the AI industry regarding the application of copyrighted works in developing and training artificial intelligence models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beginner gold investors should strategically consider several decisions before July 2025, as the price of gold could potentially surge to new records. Investors should contemplate whether to wait for a price drop, carefully considering market monitoring and the risk of being priced out. Deciding how much to invest is crucial, with the common threshold being around 10% of the overall portfolio, though this depends on individual goals and portfolio volatility. Assessing portfolio needs, such as diversification or hedging against inflation, is essential to determine if a gold investment aligns with long-term financial objectives. (not investment advice)</p>
