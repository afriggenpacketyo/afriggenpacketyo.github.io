          <p>Moody‚Äôs Investors Service downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over rising levels of government debt and a widening budget deficit. The agency criticized U.S. politicians for failing to address the country's fiscal challenges, expecting the budget deficit to keep rising due to increasing entitlement spending. While some investors anticipate a limited market impact, the downgrade may lead to higher yields on U.S. Treasuries as investors become more cautious. Despite the downgrade, some investors point out that the U.S. issues debt in its own currency and cannot technically default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>College chaplaincies are seeing increased demand despite a decline in religious affiliation among young adults, with chaplains taking on new roles to meet students' needs. Chaplains now assist students with housing insecurity, safety threats, and campus protests, in addition to providing spiritual guidance. Modern chaplains are more diverse and open, embracing alternative forms of spirituality and self-care. They offer a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose to students navigating uncertainties about faith, school, and the future. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that Pete Rose should be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame following his reinstatement to Major League Baseball. The author contends that Rose's on-field achievements, including being baseball's all-time Hit King, outweigh his gambling transgressions. The article asserts that the Hall of Fame should honor greatness, not character, and that Rose's actions did not affect game outcomes, unlike the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The author concludes that it's time to put the Hit King in Cooperstown, regardless of the opinions of baseball purists. </p>

          <p>A commercial fisherman recounts his first voyage, which turned into a harrowing ordeal when his boat sank, resulting in the captain's death and his own isolation adrift in the Pacific. After a mayday call, he was stranded for 13 days on a life raft, battling storms, hunger, and thirst, and grappling with feelings of guilt and despair. He found solace in prayer and a newfound appreciation for life, and eventually was rescued by a Canadian Coast Guard vessel. The story explores themes of survival, faith, and the search for meaning in the face of extreme adversity. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study reveals a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies, linked to the widespread availability of vaccines for pregnant women and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants. Hospitalizations in babies under seven months decreased by as much as 56%, while newborns saw a reduction of up to 71%. This trend was noted by emergency physicians, who observed fewer critically ill children from RSV this year. Research suggests spiritual development is associated with protection against depression and substance abuse, and with setting young adults up for healthier relationships, more purposeful work, and greater emotional resilience. </p>
