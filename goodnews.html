          <p>In Costa Rica, police seized crack cocaine, marijuana, knives, and five capybaras, which are the world's largest rodents, after a car chase. The two men in the vehicle, who both had criminal records, were arrested and the Security Minister noted the intersection of the drug world with the introduction of non-native species. The capybaras, which are illegal to possess, transport, or traffic in Costa Rica, were turned over to the National System of Conservation Areas to be evaluated by veterinarians and then transferred to a refuge for environmental and conservation education programs. This incident marks the first recorded case of illegal capybara trafficking in Costa Rica.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that his upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in June will be a crucial step toward resolving bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba emphasized that Japan seeks the complete removal of higher U.S. tariffs rather than settling for a reduction. He also addressed rising rice prices in Japan due to a poor harvest, promising to lower them sharply to satisfy both producers and consumers. Shinjiro Koizumi, the agriculture minister, announced the release of stockpiled rice directly to supermarkets to reduce prices, addressing public concerns about inflation and sluggish wage growth.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Qamzova, a painkiller invented in China, as a non-opioid alternative, offering a potential solution to the fentanyl-related overdose crisis. Developed by Delova, Qamzova is a long-acting injectable analgesic providing 24-hour pain relief with a single daily injection. Clinical trials have shown its effectiveness in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. This approval highlights China's growing role in innovative medicine development and provides healthcare professionals with a tool to mitigate opioid dependency risks.</p>

          <p>Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has confirmed that energy prices will fall from July, but is encouraging households to seek cheaper fixed-rate deals. A typical gas and electricity bill will decrease by ¬£11 a month, and Ofgem suggests that shopping around could save consumers up to ¬£200 annually. The price cap, which affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales, will see its first drop in a year, reflecting a fall in wholesale gas prices. Despite this, prices remain high, and many households are still struggling with energy costs and debt.</p>
