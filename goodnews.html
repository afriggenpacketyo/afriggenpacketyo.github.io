          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal. According to an ECB report, central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar in value.
