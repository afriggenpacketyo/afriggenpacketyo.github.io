          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring Kat Sadler, returns for a new series, continuing its dark and humorous exploration of modern life.

Sadler notes that the new series is influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene and will be even more daring.

          <p>Farmers in Japan are cultivating the prickly pear cactus as a nutrient-rich superfood, incorporating it into various dishes from tempura to pizza. Research from Chubu University suggests the cactus, known for being high in minerals and fiber, can enhance immune function. Miki and Motohiko Deguchi, farmers in Kasugai, are at the forefront of this movement, selling their "Sun Leaves" brand online and to restaurants. As a resilient, low-maintenance crop, experts also see its potential as a sustainable food source to combat climate change and support growing populations.</p>

          <p>Scientists are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old concept that uses viruses to kill bacteria, as a potential solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. Phages, or bacteriophages, are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria, including superbugs that have become incurable with modern medicine. A project at the University of Southampton is actively collecting phage samples from the environment to test their effectiveness against patient infections. While the science is promising, researchers note that developing phage therapy for widespread clinical use is still in its early stages but holds significant potential.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever images from beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Using a special P-band radar, the satellite can penetrate foliage and clouds to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. This groundbreaking technology will allow scientists to create a global 3D map of forests, accurately estimate carbon storage, and detect previously hidden illegal deforestation. The data is crucial for understanding the role of rainforests in mitigating climate change and for enabling quicker responses to environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to bridge the social distance that grew between her and her classmates over the years. Feeling isolated by social anxiety, she spent over 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 students she used to be friends with in her younger years. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and prompted feelings of regret among her peers for not paying more attention to her. Schafer's project served as a powerful gesture of connection and a reminder to reach out to others.</p>

While the band was musically tight and the audience receptive, the performance was noted for feeling safe and lacking some of the raw energy seen in their past shows.

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to study atmospheric data as part of the Student Airborne Research Program. The aircraft will perform vertical spirals and what appear to be missed landings at airports to collect air samples and measure land and water surfaces. NASA issued the notice to assure the public that the peculiar flight patterns are for scientific research and not a cause for alarm.</p>
