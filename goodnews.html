          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey has cautioned that consumers will likely start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite the retailer reporting better-than-expected earnings. Rainey emphasized that even with recent tariff reductions, the magnitude of increases is too significant for retailers to absorb, but that Walmart plans to keep its prices below competitors. Walmart's e-commerce business also achieved its first profitable quarter in both the U.S. and globally, driven by growth in online advertising and its third-party marketplace. While Walmart has not seen significant shifts in consumer behavior, Rainey noted that consumers are mindful of potential price increases. </p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned about potential price increases due to President Trump's tariffs. The retailer's U.S. store sales rose over 3 percent, and e-commerce sales jumped more than 20 percent, marking the first profitable quarter for that segment. Despite maintaining its full-year financial forecast, Walmart executives expressed concerns about the impact of tariffs on the company's bottom line. CFO John David Rainey indicated that shoppers could see price increases as soon as the end of the month, acknowledging the challenges of absorbing tariff pressures given narrow retail margins.</p>

These hubs would serve as processing centers for individuals awaiting deportation from the UK, but the specific countries involved remain undisclosed. This initiative differs from the previous Rwanda scheme, which was abandoned by Starmer, and aims to streamline the return process for those without further avenues of appeal.

          <p>A recent article in Vox discusses the phenomenon of "dry texting" among teenagers, which refers to short, unenthusiastic text replies that signal a change in the conversation's vibe or indicate disapproval. This subtle form of passive aggression, along with other online behaviors like leaving someone on read or unfollowing them on social media, can create ambiguity and anxiety for teens. Experts suggest that these ambiguous signals can trigger anxious thinking and make it harder for teens to develop conflict resolution skills. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the role technology plays in teens' lives and encouraging in-person communication to resolve conflicts.</p>

CEO Doug McMillon stated that Walmart will strive to maintain low prices but cannot fully absorb the impact of tariffs due to narrow retail margins.

Wadephul suggested a close alignment between Germany and the U.S. on foreign policy matters, noting Germany's readiness to take a leadership role in Europe.

The article suggests that true policing involves fighting crime within a constitutional system and wielding the law in defense of the weak.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after experiencing stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter of the year, with a 0.7% increase in GDP. This growth was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, but analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to the impact of US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite the positive figures, the Labour government acknowledges that the cost of living crisis remains a reality for many families. The Office for National Statistics noted that the services sector was the biggest driver of growth.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% growth rate at the start of the year, surpassing expectations, but this level of expansion is not anticipated to last. This growth rate is higher than that of other major economies, including those in the G7, but the effects of US tariffs and domestic tax increases are expected to slow growth in the coming months. The increase in economic activity was largely driven by strong spending on services, such as retail, hospitality, and finance.
