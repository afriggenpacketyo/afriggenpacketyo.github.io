          <h2>Study Suggests Ancestor Cell of Animals and Plants Used Hydrogen, Not Oxygen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study published in Nature suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, the foundation of complex life, lived around 2.72 billion years ago in oxygen-deficient conditions. Researchers from East China Normal University and Shenzhen University traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolising cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event. This finding supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes, challenging earlier findings about the lineage of this common ancestor. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and its potential existence in outer space.</p>

          <h2>Japan Considers Adjusting Tariff Demands in US Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is reportedly considering softening its demand for a full removal of U.S. tariffs, potentially accepting lower duty rates to secure a trade agreement with the United States. This adjustment comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator prepares for a third round of ministerial-level talks with the U.S., acknowledging President Trump's reluctance to completely eliminate tariffs. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ishiba is facing pressure to sack the farm minister due to insensitive comments about rice prices, and Honda Motor Co. plans to reduce its EV investment due to lower-than-expected market growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot maintains its full-year sales forecast and does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, according to CFO Richard McPhail. McPhail stated that Home Depot's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements enable them to maintain current pricing levels. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would raise prices to cover higher costs from tariffs. Home Depot reported first-quarter earnings that missed expectations but beat sales estimates, with McPhail noting improving sales patterns throughout the quarter and strong performance in the appliance, garden, plumbing, and electrical departments.</p>

During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Kushner acknowledged making "very, very, very serious mistakes" but stated that these mistakes have made him more qualified for the ambassadorship.</p>

          <p>World Sevens Football (W7F), a new seven-a-side format, aims to capitalize on the growing popularity of women's football by offering faster, more dynamic matches and significant financial rewards for players. With an investment of US $100 million over five years, W7F seeks to attract younger fans through shorter games and a player-centric approach. However, the inaugural event has faced criticism for clashing with the Swedish league schedule and adding to player workloads. Despite these challenges, W7F emphasizes player care, financial equity, and collaboration with players to promote women's football.</p>

          <p>Representative Yassamin Ansari is introducing the Artemis Act, named for Iranian Christian convert Artemis Ghasemzadeh, to prevent the expedited removal of individuals fleeing countries that persecute religious minorities. The bill seeks to ensure that these individuals have the opportunity to claim asylum in a U.S. immigration court. The legislation is inspired by Ghasemzadeh's deportation to Panama before she could seek asylum, highlighting the need to uphold laws that protect vulnerable migrants. Immigration lawyers say the law requires immigration officials to give migrants a "fear interview" ‚Äî a process in which they present their cases and provide evidence about why they fear being deported to their home countries.</p>
