          <p>In a recent interview on "Face the Nation," Senator Rand Paul addressed concerns about the border and tax bill, criticizing the proposed $5 trillion debt increase and the inflated cost of the border wall. He argued that the President had already effectively stopped the border flow without new legislation or funding, suggesting that the current bill is primarily benefiting the military-industrial complex. Paul also expressed skepticism about tariffs, citing opposition from Kentucky's Farm Bureau and bourbon industry, emphasizing the Republican party's traditional stance on lower taxes. He indicated that he and at least three other Republicans would likely push for modifications to the bill, particularly concerning the debt ceiling. Optimism for the bill's chances depend on if Paul's concerns are addressed. </p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a teenage transgender athlete, won two track events in California, sparking both celebration and right-wing attacks. The victories in the high jump and triple jump came shortly after the California Interscholastic Federation modified its rules to ensure that the athlete finishing behind a transgender athlete also receives the same place and medal. Hernandez has faced threats from the Trump administration, which threatened to withhold federal funding from California for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. The article highlights both the athlete's achievements and the ongoing political battle surrounding transgender athletes' rights.</p>
