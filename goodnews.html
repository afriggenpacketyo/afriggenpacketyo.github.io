          <p>Following the U.S. and China's agreement to pause reciprocal tariffs, retailers and logistics executives anticipate a surge in trade from China to the U.S., with importers resuming shipments during the 90-day window.

The article also notes that some industries are facing inventory shortages and that the trade pause may lead to a spike in ocean freight prices.

Passengers faced significant challenges, with some being redirected between stations, and one line was suspended due to a fire alert. National Grid attributed the problem to a fault on its transmission network in central London, while Network Rail cited heavy rainfall as causing drainage issues at King's Cross station.</p>

          <p>The White House is considering policies to encourage one parent to stay home with children, even while cutting back on federally funded day care. Proposed measures include increasing financial support for families with children and removing federal tax credits for day care. While some argue this would provide families with more choice, studies are unclear on whether children fare better in day care or at home. The article highlights the debate around balancing work and family and the potential impact on women in the workforce.</p>

          <p>President Trump dismissed ethical concerns about accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, stating that only someone "stupid" would reject such an offer. Trump emphasized that the gift would be to the U.S. Department of Defense and not for personal use, with plans to decommission the plane and donate it to his presidential library.

          <h2>Trump Signs Executive Order on Drug Prices, But Offers No Clear Legal Authority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 13:40:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but it lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The administration said it would consider regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries in the future if drugmakers do not comply. The executive order came hours after House Republicans offered health care policy changes that would cut Medicaid and Obamacare, and Trump directed his ire toward European governments that have negotiated lower prices. The article highlights the limited impact of the order.</p>
