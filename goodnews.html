This policy aims to create a clear distinction from the government and Reform UK, which has proposed more drastic changes to the settlement process, highlighting immigration as a key political battleground for the upcoming conference.</p>

          <p>West Ham has hired Nuno Espirito Santo as its new manager, replacing Graham Potter, as the team sits 19th in the Premier League. The appointment signals a potential return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style, similar to that of former manager David Moyes, after attempts at a possession-based approach failed. Nuno is known for organizing defensively solid teams that attack with speed, a system that analysts believe suits the current squad's strengths, particularly players like Jarrod Bowen.</p>

          <p>Moldovan President Maia Sandu's pro-European party is set to win a majority in parliamentary elections, securing around 50% of the vote. The election was held amid high tensions, with Sandu warning of "massive Russian interference" and several bomb scares reported at polling stations. The result is seen as critical for Moldova's path toward EU membership, a goal the country has pursued more urgently since Russia's full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine, despite opposition from pro-Russian political factions.</p>

          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American shopping malls is creating favorable real estate opportunities for small and local businesses. With rising vacancy rates in shopping centers, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents for tenants beyond traditional retail, such as wellness practitioners and artists. While opportunities vary by geography, this trend allows independent businesses to secure prime commercial spaces that were previously unaffordable, helping to revitalize struggling retail corridors.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group jumped 36% in their trading debut on Monday after being spun off from parent company Sony Group. The successful listing, which valued the financial arm at over $6.7 billion, is intended to allow the unit to raise its own capital for growth while Sony focuses on its entertainment and semiconductor divisions. The strong performance came as most Asian markets traded higher, with investors seemingly undeterred by recent tariff developments and looking ahead to central bank policy meetings.
