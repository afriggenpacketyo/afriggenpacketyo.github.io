          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants who subjected her to a decade of drugging and sexual assault. Her courageous case shocked the country and was instrumental in prompting legal reforms, including a bill that adds lack of consent to the criminal definition of sexual assault in France. Pelicot's advocacy continues to inspire change and challenge societal views on sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The government has established a task force to help businesses manage the impacts of global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated that the institution is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows signs of slowing. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for rates is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. The comments come as the UK economy shows signs of contraction and pressure mounts on the government to boost economic growth. The Bank's next decision on the current 4.25% interest rate is scheduled for August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, addressing their critical need for pitching talent. The choice was emotional for Bremner, whose mother recently passed away from breast cancer, and he noted the poignancy of being drafted by the Angels. Bremner, a right-hander with a strong fastball and changeup, demonstrated remarkable resilience by continuing to perform at a high level during his mother's illness. The Angels hope he can develop into a key starting pitcher for the franchise.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense against Russia's invasion. The move signals a shift after the Pentagon recently paused some arms shipments, and it comes as Trump expresses growing frustration with the lack of a peace resolution. Trump specified that the European Union and NATO would fully reimburse the U.S. for the sophisticated military equipment, framing the deal as "business for us." This decision precedes a scheduled meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Kwon Ping Ho, the founder of the Banyan Group luxury hotel chain, observes that tourism has fundamentally changed over the past 30 years. He notes that today's travelers, particularly younger generations, are no longer satisfied with simple sightseeing and instead seek unique, immersive experiences that allow for interaction with local communities. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," where travelers come from a diverse range of developing nations, not just Europe and the West. This shift has created a multifaceted and global tourism landscape, a stark contrast to the more uniform travel patterns of previous decades.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is celebrating a major milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation, making it the longest-running sequence of such data in the UK and Ireland. Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded temperature and air pressure, creating an invaluable climate record. This tradition continues today, blending human observation with modern automated systems. The data has documented significant weather events, like the "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839, and has contributed to meteorological science, including the development of the cup anemometer for measuring wind speed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Washington this week to discuss security and the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows the president's announcement of a plan to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine to bolster its defense against Russia. This strategy allows for faster deployment of arms from European allies to Ukraine. The discussions also come as bipartisan senators push for legislation that would impose heavy sanctions and tariffs on Russia and any countries that support its war economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended the first half of the season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants, solidifying their lead in the NL West. Despite a record-setting payroll, the team's performance has been inconsistent, marked by both a star-studded offense and slumps from key veterans. Sunday's game reflected this duality, with a stellar performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto followed by a blown save from the bullpen before the offense rallied in the 11th inning. While the Dodgers hold the top record in the National League, the team acknowledges the need for improvement heading into the second half.</p>
