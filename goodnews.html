          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a significant revival following the COVID-19 pandemic, with record domestic passenger numbers and increased international visitors. The market grew by 14.2 percent in 2024, and projections estimate domestic passengers will exceed 250,000 in 2025. Shipping giants like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines are expanding their cruise fleets, with new ships featuring luxury amenities and entertainment. This surge in demand signals a broader boost to local economies reliant on tourism, as well as a shift for shipping companies seeking stable income streams amid import tariff challenges.</p>

          <p>With the implementation of a large-scale deportation program, there is fear among residents and even citizens when traveling outside the United States. Immigration lawyer √Ålex G√°lvez states that citizens should not fear questioning upon return, but residents are subject to an officer's discretion. Residents risk losing their residency if they stay outside the country for more than six months or have a criminal record, as they are technically asking for permission to re-enter the country. G√°lvez advises residents planning to stay abroad for more than six months to request a permit to avoid abandonment concerns.</p>

          <p>A report by Universities UK suggests that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as many institutions are struggling to cut costs. A government review is underway to determine how higher education will be funded in the long term in England. Greater collaboration between universities could help institutions become more efficient and avoid isolated decisions about course closures. The Competition and Markets Authority recognizes the financial problems facing universities and aims to support collaboration where possible.</p>

Williams says he was given a discharge date in 1970, while others who applied for redundancy at the same time received a 1972 date, resulting in a substantially improved pension due to rule changes. Despite numerous appeals, the Ministry of Defence maintains that his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement."
