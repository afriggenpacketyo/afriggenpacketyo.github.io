          <p>In the first half of 2025, Meta deleted approximately 10 million Facebook accounts as part of a major initiative to combat spam, impersonation, and unoriginal content. The company is cracking down on accounts that repeatedly repurpose others' work without adding significant value, aiming to boost the visibility of authentic creators. This policy shift will affect content ranking and monetization, penalizing accounts with duplicate posts by reducing their reach. Meta is also exploring new methods to more clearly credit original creators, encouraging unique posts and transformative content like commentary or reaction videos.</p>

          <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his firm's economists do not foresee a recession or interest rate hikes this year, though economic growth will be slow. He anticipates the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady until mid-next year to combat inflation, which may not reach the 2% target until 2027. Moynihan noted that business caution is currently driven more by uncertainty over new administration policies on trade, deregulation, and immigration than by the direct impact of tariffs. He also commented on the long-term impact of AI, suggesting it will reshape jobs but that the economy has historically adapted to such technological shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of mis-sold car finance in the UK are expected to receive less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The plan follows a Supreme Court ruling that found extremely large, hidden commissions to be unfair, though it deemed the general practice not unlawful. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The first payouts are anticipated next year, providing some resolution for affected motorists.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a wave of spicy menu items, from sandwiches to sauces, in a strategic effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners. This trend is seen as a low-cost, high-return way to generate buzz and drive sales amid slower consumer spending. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's have recently launched spicy limited-time offers, leveraging social media platforms like TikTok to create urgency and attract younger customers. This demographic shows a strong preference for bold and adventurous flavors, pushing brands to innovate beyond traditional tastes.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments in its National Museum for American History exhibit within the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed from a section on presidential power limits. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any political pressure from the administration, explaining the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation. The updated exhibit will be designed to be consistent with permanent displays on other presidents like Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson.</p>

Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy, which put him in the lead but left him vulnerable to Piastri, who was on fresher tires in the final laps. Despite intense pressure, Norris successfully defended his position, narrowing his championship deficit to just nine points. George Russell of Mercedes finished third, overtaking Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who faded after starting on pole position.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The structure is now weather-tight, and key infrastructure like baggage systems and ticketing counter areas are taking shape. As JFK's largest terminal, it will be dedicated solely to international travel and is designed to be flooded with natural light, a departure from older airport designs. The project is part of a wider $19 billion overhaul of the airport, aimed at modernizing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic.</p>

          <p>China's advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of an aircraft catapult launch, a critical milestone for its naval aviation capabilities. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a position for take-off from the vessel. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy, which allows for launching heavier and more varied aircraft. This successful drill marks significant progress as the carrier prepares for its expected entry into service this year.</p>

          <p>A new report from HR technology company Checkr has identified the top 10 U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential, with mid-sized cities like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin leading the list. The study analyzed the 100 largest metro areas based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings suggest a shift away from traditional big-city dominance, as locations like Salt Lake City and Omaha offer strong job markets and greater affordability. Major hubs like New York and Los Angeles did not make the top 10.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals in a rocky marriage without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all joint assets, liabilities, and accounts while still married, which simplifies the process if a divorce occurs. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided. While broaching the topic can be difficult, attorneys advise that clear communication can prevent greater conflict later on.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming phrases can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums. Instead of punitive language, phrases that validate a child's feelings, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you," can de-escalate the situation. This approach focuses on connection over control, reassuring the child and helping their nervous system regulate. The article suggests that by making a child feel safe and understood, parents can reduce the intensity and frequency of emotional outbursts.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the number. Instead, he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and relationships that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to a professional team. Financial experts commented that this approach can be healthy, as it shifts focus from a potentially obsessive chase for wealth to more tangible goals and values. They advise that tracking cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal goals can be more powerful than fixating on net worth.</p>
