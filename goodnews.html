Originating from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions in the late 19th century, the holiday now serves as a three-day weekend for many. Most major retailers like Target and Walmart will remain open, while Costco, government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in a high-stakes summit that also included several European leaders. The atmosphere was reportedly less tense than their previous encounter, with the discussion focused on finding a path to peace in Ukraine. The article suggests the presence of European leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others served as an intervention to keep the talks on track and prevent a one-sided deal. Trump boasted of his peacemaking abilities while Zelenskyy navigated the delicate diplomatic situation, emerging without any major diplomatic incidents.</p>

          <p>Texas health officials have declared an end to the state's largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, which infected 762 people and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The outbreak was declared over after 42 days passed without a new case being reported. The containment effort involved extensive testing, vaccination drives, and public education campaigns. Despite this success, officials remain vigilant due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S., which have been fueled by declining vaccination rates and a record number of non-medical vaccine exemptions for schoolchildren.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet" presents an alternative history where Juliet does not die, instead embarking on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. The production, reviewed at the Ahmanson Theatre, transforms the classic tragedy into a high-energy dance party fueled by the pop anthems of producer Max Martin. The show's clever book by David West Read provides a framework for hits from artists like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The review praises the musical for its wit, vibrant performances, and a feel-good message of empowerment and second chances.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. These limits are based on risk assessment, as the buyer's age and life expectancy are key factors in determining payouts. The article explains that the best age to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for potential growth, while buying later in life can result in higher monthly payments.</p>

The article addresses past claims by President Trump about the disparity in spending, concluding the figures he cited were not supported by evidence.
