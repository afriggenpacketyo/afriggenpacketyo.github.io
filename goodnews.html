          <h2>Hungarian MEP Warns Against Complacency in Defending Democracy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 05:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Klara Dobrev, a Hungarian MEP, cautions against taking democracy for granted, drawing parallels between Hungary's illiberal drift under Viktor Orban and potential threats in the United States. She emphasizes that illiberal forces attack institutions, checks and balances, media, and freedom of speech, requiring timely reactions to prevent irreversible autocratic shifts. Dobrev highlights the importance of a broad coalition of Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, Greens, Social Democrats, and Socialists to counter illiberal populists. She also criticizes the EU's past funding of Orban's regime without proper controls, enabling the enrichment of oligarchs and the purchase of media outlets. The current situation is that Hungary needs controls built in so that money remains in Brussels. Optimism is tempered by the recognition of the challenges ahead. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 05:01:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions and Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe Tehran is unlikely to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait would disrupt global oil flows and trigger further retaliation, while also angering Iran's largest oil customer, China. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. While some disruption is possible through attacks on tankers or mining the strait, a full-scale blockade is considered unlikely due to the presence of the US Fifth Fleet and the potential for Iran to suffer more than its enemies. </p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies has shipped over 103 million smartphones and 21 million tablets running its HarmonyOS operating system, with nearly half delivered in 2024. This signals a significant shift towards its in-house OS as an alternative to Google‚Äôs Android, spurred by US sanctions. Huawei's transition to its own OS began in 2021, intensifying after being placed on the US Entity List in 2019. The company has expanded HarmonyOS beyond mobile devices, recently launching two laptops running on the system, marking a strategic move towards platform autonomy and technological sovereignty. </p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies in response to China's export restrictions, with the goal of becoming an alternative source. Experts suggest that India could play a key role in diversifying the global REE supply chain, but significant public and private investment is needed. China currently dominates REE production and processing, giving it considerable leverage over these crucial minerals. India has substantial REE reserves but lacks advanced separation and refining technology, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure. </p>
