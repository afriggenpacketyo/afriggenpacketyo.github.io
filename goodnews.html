Mensik's victory makes him the second teenager in a decade to win a main draw match at Queen's, following Jack Draper in 2021, as he overcame Norrie in three sets in the heat of London. Evans is set to face either Brandon Nakashima or Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, while Fearnley might play Taylor Fritz, and Mensik will compete against Roberto Bautista Agut. </p>

Key works include "40 Acres and a Unicorn," which asserts social and cultural confidence, and "Nobody," a geometric abstraction that critiques the art world's white supremacy.

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 can provide substantial monthly payments, generally ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, depending on personal circumstances such as gender and the payout option chosen.

Annuities provide guaranteed monthly income, offering financial security over maximum returns, but come with trade-offs, including a lack of liquidity and the potential for fixed payments to lose purchasing power over time.
