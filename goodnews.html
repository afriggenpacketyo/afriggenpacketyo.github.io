          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 02:38:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SoftBank Group announced its agreement to acquire Swiss engineering firm ABB's robotics division for $5.4 billion, a strategic move to bolster its artificial intelligence initiatives. This significant acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business, a plan previously championed by its CEO, and the proceeds will be used in line with its capital allocation principles. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son articulated a vision for "Physical AI," aiming to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), which he defines as 10,000 times smarter than humans, with robotics to propel humanity forward. The deal underscores SoftBank's aggressive investment strategy in the burgeoning AI sector, building on its significant holdings in companies like Arm and OpenAI, and diversifying its robot-related portfolio to lead the next technological evolution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 02:27:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of car finance mis-selling victims, estimating average payouts of approximately £700 per claim, totaling £8.2 billion from lenders. This figure is lower than previous estimates. The scandal stems from undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, unfair contracts, and inaccurate information provided to car buyers, which were banned in 2021. While the scheme aims to provide free access for consumers, some industry figures believe the FCA is overcompensating, and consumer groups question if the redress matches the harm. The FCA plans for the scheme to be operational by early next year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jordan Pickford, Everton's 31-year-old goalkeeper, is widely considered England's undisputed number one, poised to break his own record for consecutive clean sheets if he maintains a shutout against Wales. Football experts and former teammates laud his fast reflexes, significantly improved footwork, and exceptional long distribution, which are crucial for initiating counter-attacks. While his on-pitch temperament was once a concern, Pickford has matured, reducing histrionics and exhibiting greater composure, which positively influences his defense. His consistent high-level performances for both club and country, marked by a remarkably low error rate leading to goals, have silenced critics and cemented his vital, underappreciated role for England, especially in high-pressure major tournaments.</p>

          <p>An additional 800 trekkers, guides, and porters have been rescued from Mount Everest's eastern slope in Tingri county, China, after being stranded by a rare blizzard over the weekend. This brings the total number of people brought to safety to nearly 1,000, following an initial rescue of 350 hikers. The severe snowstorm, which struck on Saturday, cut off access to camps at over 4,900 meters altitude, leading to some cases of hypothermia. Local authorities organized rescue personnel to provide crucial assistance, including food, medicine, heating, and oxygen supplies. The scenic area has been temporarily closed due to the hazardous conditions, underscoring the dangers of extreme weather in high-altitude regions and the challenges of mountain rescue operations.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees achieved their largest comeback win in franchise history during an elimination game, rallying from a 6-1 deficit to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6 in Game 3 of the ALDS. After falling behind early, Aaron Judge delivered a crucial three-run home run in the fourth inning, tying the game and igniting the Yankees' offense.

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine in an unusual manner, while on the last day of a three-week off-grid hike in Montana's grizzly bear country. His wife, Laura O'Neill, received a flurry of text messages after his phone was taken off airplane mode, informing them of the prestigious award. Dr. Ramsdell, who initially disbelieved the news, shared the prize with two other scientists for their research on how the immune system combats infections. This humorous incident, which made contacting him the most difficult attempt for the Nobel Assembly secretary-general in years, adds to a history of laureates discovering their wins in unexpected ways.</p>

          <h2>Blood Type Conversion in Kidneys Shows Promise for Expanding Organ Transplant Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 00:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have demonstrated that converting the blood type of donor kidneys to O-type could significantly improve access to organs and reduce transplant waiting lists, addressing a critical shortage. In a study published in Nature Biomedical Engineering by teams from the University of British Columbia and West China Hospital, an enzyme-converted kidney successfully functioned for at least two days in a brain-dead recipient without signs of hyperacute rejection. This innovative approach offers a more immediate and efficient solution compared to engineered animal organs, which have faced recent failures in human trials and are years away from general practice. The findings suggest a potential breakthrough in making more human organs compatible for transplantation, thereby saving more lives and improving allocation equality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for Blake Treinen despite a three-run lead in the ninth inning. Roberts cited concerns over Sasaki's workload, as the young pitcher had recently returned from injury and was new to a bullpen role, having already pitched twice in the playoffs. Although the strategy nearly backfired, with Treinen giving up two runs, Sasaki eventually entered to secure the final out. Moving forward, Sasaki is confirmed as the primary option for save situations, though Roberts stressed the need to manage his usage carefully, especially in back-to-back appearances, given his inexperience in this role.</p>

          <p>Author and illustrator Charlie Mackesy, known for "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," revealed that the completion of his new book, "Always Remember," was significantly delayed after his iPad, containing many rough drawings and writings, was stolen from his car. The theft, which occurred because he hadn't locked his car, resulted in the loss of a substantial portion of the book's initial development, as it hadn't been backed up. Mackesy, who also recently experienced the loss of his mother and beloved dog, found resilience in overcoming this setback, embodying the positive advice from his own work. He now plans to lock his car door.</p>

          <p>Comedian Romesh Ranganathan is set to make his West End acting debut alongside Sheridan Smith in Alan Ayckbourn's "Woman in Mind," while acknowledging public perceptions of his extensive media presence. Ranganathan, a familiar face across various British entertainment platforms, joked about selectively choosing projects, prioritizing quality and personal interest, despite the "accusation" of being "on everything." He expressed both excitement and intimidation about working with the highly acclaimed Smith, who will lead the psychological comedy. Despite feeling "nervous" about his stage debut, Ranganathan views this as a significant opportunity, reflecting his desire to explore new creative avenues and manage his career amidst the challenges of potential overexposure in the entertainment landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed Trilogy Metals surged over 200% following the White House's announcement of a partnership and a 10% equity stake acquisition in the Canadian minerals exploration company. This $35.6 million investment is part of a broader US initiative to unlock domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, zinc, and lead in Alaska's Ambler mining district. Trilogy Metals welcomed President Trump's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project, reversing a Biden administration rejection, viewing it as a commitment to responsible resource development. The move aims to secure domestic supply chains, addressing Western concerns over China's dominance in critical mineral processing essential for clean energy and defense technologies.
