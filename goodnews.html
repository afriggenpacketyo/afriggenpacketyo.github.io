        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children starting in January of the upcoming year. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. This decision aims to protect children from severe complications and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work, estimated to cost £24 million annually. Health officials hope the move will make chickenpox a "thing of the past," aligning the UK with other countries that have offered the vaccine for years.</p>

In his place, the squad features first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba announced better-than-expected net income for the June quarter, largely fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. The company attributed this strong performance to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue showing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenues slightly missed analyst forecasts, the firm's e-commerce business also showed signs of revival. However, profitability in the e-commerce sector was impacted by heavy investment in the competitive "instant commerce" market in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth in the quarter ending in June, expanding at an annual rate of 7.8%, which exceeded economists' forecasts of 6.7%. The strong performance was primarily driven by the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors, indicating broad-based economic momentum. This figure represents an acceleration from the 7.4% growth recorded in the previous quarter. The result supports projections from the World Bank and IMF, which anticipate India's economy will continue to expand at a healthy pace for the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 81-year-old woman who died during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has finally been identified as Dorothy Virginia Driggers Taquino, bringing closure to her family just before the storm's 20th anniversary. Her remains were discovered in her flooded home in Arabi, Louisiana, but she was buried in an unmarked grave for unidentified victims after initial identification efforts failed. A recent investigation by a local news outlet, WWL Louisiana, in partnership with the local coroner, used property records and a high school necklace to confirm her identity. Her family is now arranging to move her to a burial plot she had chosen before her death.</p>

          <p>Nearly 1,000 protests are scheduled across all 50 U.S. states for the Labor Day week, organized by the AFL-CIO and other groups to oppose the policies of the Trump administration.

Organizers are protesting policies such as attempts to rescind collective bargaining rights for federal workers and cuts to minimum wage requirements for contractors. The events aim to channel strong public support for labor unions into a unified voice against what they describe as an agenda that prioritizes corporate interests over those of working people.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois has launched IL Pride Connect, a first-of-its-kind, state-funded legal hotline and resource hub for the LGBTQ+ community. The initiative provides free, affirming legal advice and referrals on issues such as healthcare access and changing names and gender markers on official documents. Governor JB Pritzker stated the program aims to fight "cruelty with compassion" and protect LGBTQ+ residents. This move comes at a time when other states and the federal government under the Trump administration have rolled back funding and protections for LGBTQ+ initiatives, including the shutdown of a national youth suicide lifeline.</p>

          <h2>Report Finds Higher-Income Households More Likely to Return Retail Purchases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Bank of America Institute reveals that wealthier shoppers return a higher percentage of their retail purchases compared to other income groups. In 2025, high-income households refunded 5.3% of their purchases, while lower-income households returned only 3.7%. The analysis suggests that affluent consumers are more likely to engage in "bracketing," where they buy multiple versions of an item with the intention of returning most of them. This trend contributes to the high cost of returns for retailers, who have responded by tightening their return policies, such as by charging fees or shortening return windows.</p>

          <p>High-end ranch brokers are observing a trend of historic, multigenerational "trophy" ranches being listed for sale, often for the first time in decades. Many heirs of these large properties are choosing to sell due to disagreements over the future of the homesteads or a lack of interest in maintaining the ranching lifestyle. These legacy properties, some spanning tens of thousands of acres and priced in the tens of millions, are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a connection to nature, a phenomenon partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. The sales represent a significant generational transfer of both wealth and land.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion column in the Los Angeles Times argues that the current college affordability crisis stems from a shift in government policy away from viewing higher education as a public good. The article traces a long history of government investment in college, from Thomas Jefferson's proposals to the G.I. Bill, arguing that such subsidies were seen as essential for democracy and national security. The author contends that the skyrocketing cost of tuition began in the 1980s when state funding was cut, shifting the financial burden onto students. The column concludes that restoring affordability requires renewed government investment, not further reductions in support.</p>
