        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new interview for the 40th anniversary of "Back to the Future," actor Michael J. Fox spoke out against what he calls a pervasive "bully culture" in society today. He identified his own battle with Parkinson's disease as his personal "bully," drawing a parallel to the film's themes of standing up to adversity and showing resilience. Fox, who was diagnosed with the degenerative brain disorder 35 years ago, is returning to acting in the show "Shrinking," where his character also has Parkinson's. He emphasized the importance of courage in confronting life's challenges, whether they are bullies, time, or a chronic illness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some six-month CDs offering APYs around 4.45%. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider strategies like CD laddering to lock in high rates for various terms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs present a more affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards in the current high-interest-rate environment. As of October 22, 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.28%, while HELOCs average 7.84%. These products offer lower rates and potential tax benefits if used for eligible home improvements. However, since the home serves as collateral, it is crucial for borrowers to carefully consider their budget and shop for the best terms before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging housing market with high rates and low inventory, securing a favorable mortgage or refinance rate is still possible for applicants with strong credit. As of October 22, 2025, the national average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is 6.33%, with a 15-year mortgage averaging 5.72%. Experts suggest that as the Federal Reserve potentially stops raising rates, mortgage rates may also stabilize. To obtain the best rates, prospective borrowers should focus on improving their credit scores, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of several quantum-computing firms, including IonQ and D-Wave, surged following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking equity stakes in them in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with a recent strategy of investing in industries deemed vital to national security, such as rare earths and semiconductors, to compete with China. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and President Trump have argued that the government should share in the success of companies that benefit from public funds. This potential investment highlights Washington's focus on quantum computing as a strategically critical technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a deeply personal essay, the author explores how running has shaped his life, serving as a connection to his brilliant but troubled father and a tool to avoid his father's self-destructive path. The narrative weaves together memories of running with his father, his own journey as a competitive marathoner, and a harrowing battle with thyroid cancer at age 30. He recounts how the discipline of running helped him reclaim his health and identity after his diagnosis, ultimately running a marathon faster than before he got sick. The author reflects on running as a source of mental clarity, resilience, and a way to process life's greatest challenges.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, a seasoned executive with nearly three decades of experience, to serve as its new chief commercial officer. The appointment comes as the airline seeks to improve its profitability, which has been lagging behind competitors like Delta and United. Pieper previously held senior roles at Delta and Alaska Airlines and most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance. He replaces Vasu Raja, who was ousted in 2024 after a controversial business-travel strategy failed. CEO Robert Isom praised Pieper as a collaborative leader focused on delivering results.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill known as the IRS MATH Act has passed both the House and Senate and is now awaiting the president's signature. The legislation aims to make the "math error notices" sent by the IRS for simple tax return mistakes clearer and easier for taxpayers to understand. Currently, taxpayers have 60 days to respond to these notices before the proposed changes become final, but lawmakers and advocates argue the existing letters are confusing. While the new law won't reduce the number of errors, it is intended to help taxpayers better comprehend the issue and the necessary steps for correction.</p>

Zhang was initially detained in Mexico in October 2024 but escaped custody in July. His arrest in Cuba marks a significant development in the international effort to combat the trafficking of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid driving an overdose epidemic in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. slowed to just 1.4% in August year-over-year, the smallest increase recorded in 15 years, according to data from Cotality. This slowdown was observed across all price tiers, continuing a cooling trend seen in the second half of the year. While cities like Chicago still saw robust growth, others like Dallas experienced a slight decline in rent prices due to a surge in new apartment construction. This trend mirrors the multifamily apartment sector, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high. (not investment advice)</p>

The joint venture aims to establish a powerful regional player with the scale to compete globally, particularly against Elon Musk's Starlink. The new entity will employ 25,000 people and combine the companies' complementary technologies to offer end-to-end space solutions, excluding space launchers. This move is seen as a pivotal step for Europe to enhance its technological sovereignty and build a more competitive presence in the increasingly dynamic global space market.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be around 2.7% to 2.8%, a modest increase compared to the record-high adjustments seen during the post-pandemic inflation spike. While the COLA is designed to help benefits keep pace with rising prices, some retirees express concern that the smaller increase will not be enough to cover elevated costs for essentials like healthcare and housing. The adjustment is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index, so as inflation cools, the COLA also decreases, reflecting a more stable but still challenging economic environment for beneficiaries.
