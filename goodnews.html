          <p>President Trump announced that House Republicans who initially voted against advancing key cryptocurrency regulation bills, including the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, have now agreed to support them. This dramatic reversal followed a White House meeting, highlighting Trump's significant influence over the Republican conference and the swift political maneuvering involved. The legislation aims to establish regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and other digital assets, and to prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. This unexpected flip among the holdouts underscores the complex interplay between political leadership and emerging financial technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced over $90 billion in new private sector investments for Pennsylvania, aiming to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's technology and energy resources. This initiative, unveiled at the Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, includes plans for constructing data centers to power AI and an energy innovation center to train workers, promising tens of thousands of jobs. The event, however, faced protests from activists concerned about fossil fuels and AI's ethical implications, leading to police using pepper spray on demonstrators who were blocking streets and confronting attendees.</p>

          <p>The GENIUS Act, a bill regulating stablecoins, is progressing through Congress with bipartisan support, aiming to establish clear rules for the $250 billion digital currency market. This legislation, along with other crypto bills, aligns with President Trump's goal to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world." Stablecoins, designed to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, could facilitate faster and lower-cost financial transactions for businesses and consumers. However, they carry inherent risks, such as "depegging" from their underlying assets, as seen in past bank failures. Major banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are actively exploring how to integrate stablecoins into their business operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has publicly advocated for free trade and globalization, condemning unilateral sanctions and trade barriers, in an article published for the China International Supply Chain Expo. His statements reiterate China's stance as a champion of open trade, aiming to contrast with the protectionist policies often associated with US President Donald Trump. Xi emphasized upholding "genuine multilateralism" and promoting "an inclusive and universally beneficial economic globalization" amidst rising international protectionism. This positioning highlights China's desire to shape global economic discourse and its own role within it.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media, People's Daily, has urged local governments to leverage legislation as a "propeller" for economic and social development, emphasizing the creation of stable and open systems where market entities can operate within the rule of law. This initiative follows a 2015 modification that expanded cities' power to draft local laws, shifting from reliance on direct orders to law-based governance for economic issues. The article highlights that creative, tailored legislation at the local level is crucial for reaching the public and securing long-term economic benefits, stressing the importance of adapting to the needs of economic and social developments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine scientists in Miami are undertaking an innovative effort to restore Florida's imperiled coral reefs by crossbreeding local Elkhorn coral with more resilient strains from Honduras. This pioneering "Flonduran" coral aims to withstand the devastating impacts of warming ocean waters and disease, which have wiped out over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral. This is the first time an international cross of corals has been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs. The first crossbred species have now been planted, with hopes that these tougher corals will provide crucial coastal protection against hurricane-fueled waves. Scaling up this project is essential for rebuilding the vital reef system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have unveiled two new alternate uniforms for the 2025 season: a yellowish-gold "Charger Power" look with matching pants and navy blue "Super Chargers" uniforms. The gold design, marking the first time the team will wear gold jerseys in a game, draws inspiration from 1970s fan apparel and has elicited varied reactions online, including comparisons to Minions and mustard. The navy uniform, featuring a navy blue jersey, pants, and helmet, serves as a modern throwback to the team's San Diego era from 1992 to 2006. These new looks aim to energize the team's brand and appeal to a younger demographic.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade pact with Indonesia, setting a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods entering the US, significantly lower than the previously threatened 32%. In return, Indonesia committed to substantial purchases, including $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets, many of them 777s. This agreement, finalized after discussions with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, is part of Trump's broader strategy to secure trade deals and address perceived unfair practices. The specific timeline for these purchases remains unclear, but the deal aims to boost US exports and rebalance trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Central Banks Boost Gold Reserves by Purchasing from Domestic Mines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:31:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks are increasingly acquiring gold directly from domestic mines to bolster their reserves, driven by surging gold prices and the desire to support local industries without impacting foreign exchange reserves. This method is often cheaper than buying on the international market, allowing central banks to grow reserves using local currency and avoid sacrificing other reserve assets. While beneficial for monetary flexibility and supporting domestic mining, it can pose risks related to processing standards and labor practices in artisanal and small-scale mining. This trend reflects a broader strategy among central banks to strengthen their reserve buffers and shield against sudden financial shocks amid rising global debt and geopolitical risks.

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from L.A. County. His wrongful conviction stemmed from shaky witness testimony and ignored alibi evidence, including his presence at his mother's birthday party and wearing a cast that would have made pulling a trigger unlikely. The settlement follows a judge's finding of factual innocence in April 2022 and a lawsuit alleging that sheriff's homicide detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and ignored new information pointing to another suspect. This outcome aims to mitigate the harm caused by two decades of wrongful incarceration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review recommends that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" and wear standardized clothing and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. This recommendation stems from concerns over patient confusion and safety, with the review hearing from families whose relatives died after being treated by PAs they believed were qualified doctors. The review highlighted that the roles were introduced without a clear national plan, leading to ambiguity and instances where PAs covered medical posts without adequate oversight. While some patients reported satisfaction, the British Medical Association argues the review should have gone further to clarify responsibilities.</p>

          <p>An advert for "Trip" drinks, which contain ingredients like magnesium and CBD, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for making unauthorized claims about promoting calmness and reducing stress or anxiety. The ASA found the claims, such as "help you feel calm" and "crafted for calm," violated rules on marketing food and drink ingredients with health benefits not listed on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register. The company also made inaccurate "0g added sugar" claims, further breaching advertising codes. The ruling mandates the advert not reappear in its current form, and the company was told not to claim its drinks could prevent, treat, or cure human disease.</p>
