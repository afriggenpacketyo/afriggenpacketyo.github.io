          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory over Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race. Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, capitalized on social media engagement and enthusiasm among younger voters. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign and its appeal to young people, later indicating the possibility of an independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, as no candidate secured over 50% of the vote, with comprehensive results expected in early July. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the general election in heavily Democratic New York. The possibility of incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent adds another layer of complexity to the election. Optimism score is not contained in this summary.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup's scheduling highlights the challenge of playing soccer in the U.S. during the summer heat, posing risks for the 2026 World Cup. Games are often scheduled for European viewers, leading to midday kick-offs in hot U.S. venues, which can disadvantage European teams. Despite concerns, historical data from past tournaments in the U.S. doesn't definitively show European teams struggling more in the heat. Organizers could improve scheduling by prioritizing cooler locations and times, but ultimately, elite players are mostly able to endure harsh conditions, though this doesn't mean they should have to.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has criticized a recent CIA campaign to recruit Chinese informants, deeming it a "farcical performance." The MSS claims the CIA is exaggerating the "China threat" to secure larger budgets. This response follows the CIA's release of Chinese-language videos aimed at exploiting dissatisfaction among Chinese officials and encouraging them to leak secrets. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman previously condemned the recruitment drive as a serious violation of China's national interests and a blatant political provocation.</p>

          <p>Researchers at San Carlos Clinical Hospital in Madrid found that injecting mice skin with stem cells from human fat, combined with an energy-boosting molecule, improved hair regrowth. Male mice achieved the best results with low-dose stem cells and ATP, while female mice responded better to medium doses. The researchers achieved high percentages of hair regrowth in both male and female mice, suggesting a potential new therapeutic approach for androgenetic alopecia. Human clinical trials are planned to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, with a potential availability timeline of approximately five years.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why the recent conflict between Israel and Iran has not led to an oil crisis, despite initial price spikes. Several factors have contributed to this resilience, including Iran's decision not to target oil supplies, traders' skepticism of price spikes, and the approach of the autumn season. The world's oversupply of oil and the U.S.'s dominant position as a producer have also played significant roles in stabilizing the market. Despite geopolitical tensions, the oil market has proven resilient to disruptions.</p>

For heat exhaustion, it is advised to move to a cool place, drink water, and apply cold cloths. Heat stroke requires immediate medical attention, cooling the body with cold water, and calling emergency services.

          <p>The launch of a private astronaut mission by SpaceX has exposed a new twist in a potentially dangerous issue at the International Space Station. A leak in a Russia-controlled module, initially thought to be gradually decreasing, has stopped, raising concerns that a new leak may have formed on an interior wall. Space station operators are worried that the entire station is beginning to lose air, prompting investigations and pressure adjustments. The private mission, Ax-4, proceeded after NASA and Roscosmos addressed the issue, but the long-term effects on space station operations remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called on other countries to collaborate on trade, despite rising tariffs and other barriers. He emphasized that globalization will not be reversed and urged all sides not to turn trade into a political or security issue. Engaging in the international economy is a way of "reshaping the rules and order," Li added, calling on countries to keep to the "right" path. Li did not comment specifically on U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict.</p>

          <p>Jordan's women's football team is aiming to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup, inspired by the men's recent qualification for their first World Cup. The team came close to qualifying in previous years and is now focused on a top-six finish in the 2026 Asian Cup to secure a spot. The women's program has grown steadily since its launch in 2005, with increased participation, a professional league, and greater public interest. Financial benefits from the men's World Cup appearance are expected to further support the women's game.</p>
