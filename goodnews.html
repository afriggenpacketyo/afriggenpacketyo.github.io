          <p>EPA chief Lee Zeldin announced a major overhaul to reduce staffing to Reagan-era levels, aiming to save taxpayers $300 million annually by next year. The reorganization focuses on incorporating science into rule-making and ensuring clean air, land, and water, with a shift in the research office to prioritize statutory obligations and mission-essential functions. A new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions will be created, and the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention will add experts to address backlogs. Zeldin also highlighted the end of COVID-era remote work and the cancellation of $22 billion in grants and contracts to reduce excess spending.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies 'Why Can't You Be More Like...' as a Relationship-Breaking Phrase</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships. This comparison implies that the partner is inadequate and that someone else could do a better job. Over time, this can lead to insecurity and questioning of self-worth, rather than feeling loved for who they are. The phrase often stems from a deeper issue: the fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations, creating a need for clear communication without shame or comparison.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's parody commercial, "Forever 31," resonated with millennial women by humorously depicting the anxieties of aging and the desire for comfortable yet stylish clothing. The sketch showcased baggy, chic basics in muted colors, catering to women who prioritize comfort and practicality over trendiness. The humor derived from the relatability of the brand's offerings to millennial experiences and concerns, such as economic instability, changing beauty standards, and future planning. The sketch's success lies in its affectionate skewering of millennial aesthetics and its understanding of the pressures and priorities of this generation.</p>

          <p>A developer in Dallas is exploring ways to retrofit single-family homes into multi-family units to address the affordable housing crisis. By dividing existing homes into smaller apartments, he aims to provide more affordable options in areas where apartment buildings are restricted by zoning laws. This approach seeks to capitalize on the mismatch between large, underused homes and the growing demand for smaller, more affordable living spaces. Several cities and states are also encouraging similar initiatives, such as allowing backyard homes and subdividing lots, to increase housing density without causing major disruption to existing neighborhoods.</p>
