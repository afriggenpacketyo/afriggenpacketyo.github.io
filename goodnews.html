          <p>A recent PwC consumer survey reveals that families are maintaining their back-to-school spending despite economic pressures, with nearly three-quarters expecting to spend the same or more than in 2024. Consumers are value-oriented, focusing on necessities like books and school supplies, while cutting back on technology and clothing. Retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have indicated plans to raise some prices, influenced by concerns about tariffs. Artificial intelligence is also playing a role, with one in five shoppers planning to use AI tools to find online deals. Gen Z parents are more likely to shop exclusively in physical stores, contributing to the resilience of brick-and-mortar retail.</p>

One portrait features Lakeydria Houston, a survivor of sexual assault in the Army, portrayed as strong and stable. The exhibit also features portraits by Tarik Warren, a campus maintenance worker who painted the gallery's walls and is now a featured artist.

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres has offered rare praise for President Donald Trump following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This positive statement comes days after Guterres condemned U.S. strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, expressing alarm over the growing risk of conflict. Trump announced the ceasefire after what he called the "12-Day War," referencing Israel's historic Six-Day War. The President later expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran as the ceasefire appeared to falter, but ultimately affirmed that Israel would not attack Iran, and both sides wanted to end the war.</p>

While acknowledging the validity of criticism and concern, the author argues that the "Iraq syndrome cosplay" is misleading, as there is no proposed "boots on the ground" scenario. The author emphasizes that Iran has been committing acts of war against America and Israel for decades through terrorist proxies and that the intelligence regarding Iran's nuclear program has changed. The author concludes that while the situation could worsen, it is unlikely to resemble the events in Iraq, except for those unwilling to see it differently.</p>

          <p>Manchester United are reportedly targeting Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo to improve their attacking options. Mbeumo is expected to add power, strength, and goal-scoring ability to the team, which struggled to score goals last season. United is aiming to bring in players who are used to the Premier League to minimize settling-in time. Mbeumo's arrival is part of a broader reshaping of the squad, and the team is expected to be a bigger goal threat next season.</p>
