          <p>Shares in SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record after the company announced fiscal first-quarter profits that significantly surpassed analyst predictions. The Japanese investment firm reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from a loss in the same period last year, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. This growth was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, fueled by successful investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of its portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to launch initial public offerings soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, confirming its identity with experts. This sighting marks a significant northward expansion for the species, which has been colonizing Northern Europe at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year over the last decade. While a warming climate is considered a factor in this rapid spread, it is uncertain if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are set to sign a historic peace declaration at the White House, marking an end to decades of conflict. The Trump administration facilitated the breakthrough by helping resolve a dispute over the Zangezur Corridor, a key transit route. As part of the agreement, Armenia will grant the U.S. exclusive development rights to the corridor for 99 years, and both nations will sign bilateral economic agreements with Washington. This diplomatic achievement also includes the U.S. lifting restrictions on defense cooperation with Azerbaijan, signaling a major shift in regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>New Zealand authorities have established a Controlled Area Notice around Hauturu-ō-Toi (Little Barrier Island) to combat the spread of an invasive seaweed known as exotic caulerpa. The measure restricts anchoring and bottom-contact fishing to prevent small fragments of the seaweed from being transported to new areas. Discovered in 2021, the invasive species poses a significant threat to the island's unique and pristine ecosystem, which serves as a vital nature reserve for many native plants and rare birds. This decisive action aims to protect one of the country's most treasured and ecologically sensitive habitats.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Frustrated with the limitations of online dating, many are seeking genuine, face-to-face connections. This trend is reflected in business data, with dating app Bumble's value declining and attendance at singles events rising by 42% last year. Organizers of events like Date Cincy report significant success in helping people form relationships, suggesting a cultural shift back toward spontaneous, real-world romantic encounters.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Lucasfilm and its parent company, Disney, over a lawsuit she filed alleging wrongful termination from the series "The Mandalorian."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. The new system would confine offenders to specific, designated areas rather than just excluding them from certain zones where victims live. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, this approach aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind and the freedom to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. While the plan has been welcomed by victims' advocates, probation officers have raised concerns about increased workload and pressure on an already strained service.</p>

          <h2>Texas Roadhouse Reports Mixed Quarterly Results Amid Rising Beef Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse has reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with strong sales growth offset by declining profitability due to soaring beef prices. The company's revenue of $1.51 billion surpassed expectations, driven by increased customer traffic, but its earnings per share of $1.86 fell short of analyst estimates. Management noted that while the brand's value proposition continues to attract diners, persistent commodity inflation remains a major headwind. The company plans a modest 1.7% menu price increase in the fourth quarter to help mitigate the impact of these higher input costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major Chinese automakers have begun to reduce the steep discounts on electric vehicles, following intervention from Beijing aimed at stabilizing the industry. A fierce price war had driven industry-wide discounts to a record high of over 17% in recent months, threatening the profitability and long-term health of a sector where China is a global leader. While the reduction in discounts is an encouraging sign, analysts caution that the root cause of the intense competition—significant overcapacity in the market—remains unresolved. A sustainable recovery of pricing power may therefore still be a long way off. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK holidaymakers are increasingly booking shorter, last-minute domestic trips, a trend travel firms attribute to budget constraints and a desire to capitalize on good weather. Companies like Booking.com and Pitchup.com report a significant rise in spontaneous bookings for UK-based getaways, with the time between booking and travel shrinking. This shift suggests that many Britons are saving money by forgoing international travel in favor of more affordable and flexible staycations. The trend also points to a revival in camping and a preference for quieter, less expensive destinations within the UK.</p>

          <p>A pop-up health clinic on the quayside in Brixham, Devon, is being highlighted as a successful model for the future of the NHS in England. The clinic brings GPs, nurses, and specialists directly to fishermen, a community that often struggles to access traditional healthcare services. By offering targeted, preventative care in a convenient location, the initiative has successfully diagnosed conditions like diabetes and cancer early. This approach aligns with the NHS's 10-year plan to shift focus from hospital-based treatment to community-based prevention, tailoring services to the specific needs of local populations.</p>
