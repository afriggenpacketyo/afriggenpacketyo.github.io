          <p>Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, the surviving members of the iconic progressive rock band Rush, will reunite for a 50th-anniversary tour in 2026. The 12-date tour is set to honor their late drummer, Neil Peart, who passed away in 2020, and will kick off at the Kia Forum, the site of their final show with Peart in 2015. Acclaimed German drummer Anika Nilles will join them for the tour, a decision Lee explained was made after recognizing her remarkable talent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates and more reductions expected, savers should carefully evaluate where to place funds for optimal returns. This article compares the earnings of a $10,000 deposit in a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account over various time frames. While a high-yield savings account may currently offer a slightly higher rate, its variable nature means returns will likely decrease with future Fed cuts. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed rate, guaranteeing a specific return, which could prove more advantageous in a declining rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 16:04:18 EDT</div>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 23% after the company announced a major multi-year partnership with OpenAI. The deal involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's AI accelerator chips and gives OpenAI the potential to acquire up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker through a warrant. This strategic agreement positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI, reducing the AI leader's reliance on a single vendor, Nvidia. The partnership underscores the immense demand for computing power in the AI industry and is one of the largest GPU deployment agreements to date.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may find them increasingly affordable as the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting interest rates. This article calculates the potential monthly payments for a $150,000 HELOC, showing that current costs are lower than they were a year ago due to rate reductions. A HELOC's variable rate means payments can decrease as market rates fall, making it an attractive option compared to fixed-rate loans in the current economic climate. Borrowers must still carefully assess their ability to manage payments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their retirement income, understanding the equity requirements is crucial. Most lenders offering a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), the most common type, require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property. The amount an individual can borrow is not the full equity amount but is instead determined by factors including the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the required equity, options include paying down the existing mortgage or waiting for the home's value to appreciate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bread and Puppet Theater, a politically radical performance troupe founded in 1963, continues to tour the U.S. with its signature giant puppets and anti-war message. Known for its presence at protests for generations, the group performs contemporary versions of medieval mystery plays that address modern political issues, including staunchly pro-Palestinian themes in its current show. Founder Peter Schumann, now 91, still directs the troupe, which aims to "make the revolution irresistible" while handing out fresh sourdough bread. Despite some walkouts, the puppeteers remain committed to their ethos of political critique.</p>
