McIlroy found water off the tee, while Scheffler and Schauffele struggled with their approach shots, also ending up in the water. Scheffler attributed his mishap to a "mud ball," highlighting the unpredictable conditions of the course.

However, county officials are requesting that both facilities remain offline until the cause of the January fire is determined and stronger emergency protocols are in place.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New clinical testing requirements may delay the availability of updated Covid vaccines this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation. FDA officials are seeking more clinical data before approving Novavax's Covid vaccine, and are also questioning the CDC's data on the impact of Covid on children under 12. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine vaccine infrastructure by raising safety doubts and creating untenable requirements for manufacturers.</p>
