          <p>The London City Lionesses have agreed to a world-record £1.4 million fee to sign French international midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain. This landmark deal surpasses the previous record in women's football and signals the club's ambitious intentions in the Women's Super League. The acquisition is part of a significant summer investment by American owner Michele Kang, who is building a formidable squad to challenge the league's established powers. Geyoro's arrival is expected to elevate the team's performance and draw further attention to the rapidly growing club.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened higher following President Trump's signing of an executive order to lower U.S. import tariffs on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%. The order also solidified a commitment for $550 billion in Japanese investments into American projects, boosting investor confidence. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant jump, and other regional indices also posted gains in response to the positive trade news. This development is seen as a de-escalation of trade tensions and a stimulus for the automotive sectors in both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a significant increase in popularity, with a third of American adults now having at least one tattoo, a persistent stigma surrounding body art remains. While many, particularly younger generations, view tattoos as a form of personal expression and art, studies show that individuals with tattoos may still face negative assumptions and are less likely to be hired or trusted. This cultural shift is highlighted by art exhibits featuring tattoo artists' work, yet societal perceptions have been slow to fully catch up. The article explores the evolving acceptance of tattoos in modern culture.</p>

          <p>Lakeside High School in Georgia's DeKalb County School District is observing positive changes since implementing a "Disconnect to Reconnect" program that bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers report that the policy has created a better learning environment with fewer distractions, allowing them to regain students' attention and leading to improved engagement. The initiative is part of a broader trend, with over half of U.S. states enacting laws to regulate phone use in schools. The district's early results suggest that such policies can significantly reduce classroom disruptions and enhance academic focus.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have pledged to provide post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, which could include an international force. The commitment was made following a summit in Paris aimed at solidifying long-term support for Kyiv and clarifying the U.S. position under President Trump. Macron stated that these forces would not be on the front lines but would serve to deter future aggression. This development marks a significant step in establishing a durable security framework for Ukraine once the current conflict concludes.</p>

          <p>The parents of Chloe Childress, a counselor who died in a devastating flash flood at Camp Mystic, have successfully advocated for new safety legislation in Texas. The new laws, passed by the state legislature, will prohibit cabins in flood zones, mandate warning systems, and require emergency training and better communication protocols for campgrounds. The effort was driven by families of the victims who argued the tragedy was preventable. The parents hope these new regulations will serve as a model for other states to improve safety standards at camps.</p>

          <p>Notes for an unknown final project by David Bowie, an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," have been discovered and donated to the V&A Museum. Found locked in his New York study after his death, the materials reveal Bowie's deep interest in the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 1700s London, with references to notorious thief Jack Sheppard. The project, which was a secret even to his closest collaborators, would have fulfilled his lifelong ambition to write for the theater. These documents offer new insight into the artist's creative process and historical fascinations.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, suggested in an interview that enterprises are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. He explained that while these autonomous AI agents, which can perform tasks like booking flights, are appealing to consumers, they pose significant security risks for businesses. The autonomy of these agents conflicts with enterprise needs for credential management and security protocols. Arora's comments came as he discussed his company's planned acquisition of identity security provider CyberArk, emphasizing the critical importance of protecting corporate data from credential theft.</p>

Jones emphasized that the trade was not personal but a calculated decision to optimize the team's roster and salary cap management, allowing for greater flexibility and reducing the risk of concentrating resources on a single player.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has introduced a measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The measure aims to establish a maximum temperature threshold, similar to the existing requirement for heating, to protect tenants' health and safety.</p>
