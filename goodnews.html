          <p>Apple is reportedly planning to launch a folding iPhone as early as next year, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The device is expected to feature a display manufactured by Samsung Display, with potential production of up to eight million foldable panels. While other components, such as the hinge, are still under consideration, the folding iPhone is anticipated to be priced as a premium product. This move comes as Apple seeks to diversify its product line and attract new customers amid peaking iPhone revenue, signaling the company's continued efforts to innovate and maintain its market dominance.</p>

Meta's open-source Llama large language models are central to its strategy, competing with models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini. While Meta has faced challenges, such as delays in releasing its most advanced language model, Zuckerberg has taken steps to recruit top talent and invest in AI research, reinforcing Meta's commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in the digital advertising market.

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated but was convicted of driving while intoxicated in the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe. The retrial took place in Norfolk County Superior Court, following a mistrial last year due to a deadlocked jury. The case garnered significant attention, with Read accused of backing into and running over O'Keefe, while the defense argued he was killed inside a house and the scene was staged. The defense highlighted a botched police investigation and raised questions about evidence, while the prosecution focused on forensic data and Read's statements at the scene. The jury ultimately found her not guilty on the most serious charges.</p>

          <p>Shares of Coinbase and Circle experienced a surge after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins.

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, saw a substantial increase in its stock price, continuing its remarkable run since its recent stock market debut. The GENIUS Act now moves to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with the House's version of the bill, STABLE, potentially paving the way for growth in the stablecoin market.
