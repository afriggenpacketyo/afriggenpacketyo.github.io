          <p>Chinese aircraft manufacturer Comac has received one of its largest-ever overseas orders for its C909 regional passenger jets from Air Cambodia. This deal marks a significant expansion for China's aviation industry into Southeast Asia, with Cambodia becoming the fourth nation in the region to operate the aircraft. The C909, designed for short-haul flights, is a key part of China's strategy to compete with established Western planemakers, and this agreement includes cooperation on operational support and broader industry development.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have adopted a more conciliatory tone, signaling optimism that a trade deal can be reached between the two nations. This comes after months of friction over US tariffs on Indian imports and New Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil. Despite the positive rhetoric, reports have emerged that Trump recently urged the European Union to impose heavy tariffs on both India and China for their Russian energy trade, highlighting the complex dynamics underlying the negotiations.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the 'Plattenbau,' the prefabricated concrete apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to postwar housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of social decay and extremism following German reunification. The exhibition uses art to revisit the multifaceted history of these structures, examining them as spaces of collective memory, social change, and painful transformation.</p>

The new institution, to be named the London and South East University Group, aims to build a stronger financial foundation to navigate the economic challenges facing the higher education sector. While the individual university brands and campuses will be retained, the move represents a significant consolidation designed to ensure long-term viability and resilience.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's self-identification on a past university application as both 'Asian' and 'Black or African American' has generated controversy in the US. However, in his birth country of Uganda, his complex heritage is viewed as unremarkable. The article explores the long history of the influential Ugandan Indian community, noting that multi-hyphenated identities are common and widely accepted, contrasting sharply with the more rigid racial categories often used in American discourse.</p>

          <p>The upcoming super-fight between Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Terence Crawford is being analyzed as a legacy-defining moment for both boxers. A key factor in the matchup is Crawford's ambitious move up two weight classes to challenge the undisputed super-middleweight champion. Analysts are weighing whether Crawford's technical skill and reach advantage can overcome the natural size and power of Alvarez, who has extensive experience fighting at the higher weight.</p>

As one of the few openly gay male athletes in his sport, he hopes his visibility can serve as an inspiration for younger generations.</p>

          <p>Despite a poor run of results with only two Premier League wins since April, underlying statistics suggest Manchester United's performances have been stronger than their point tally implies. An analysis shows the team has taken the most shots in the league over the last 10 games while conceding among the fewest. The primary issues appear to be in execution, with players underperforming in both scoring goals from created chances and in goalkeeping, rather than a fundamental flaw in the team's tactical setup.</p>
