          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix surged significantly following their partnership with OpenAI for its Stargate initiative. This collaboration aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI and expand data center capacity in Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean leaders and company executives to finalize these agreements. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, is already mass-producing next-generation high-bandwidth memory chips, while Samsung is working to certify its own HBM4 chips, intensifying their competition in the AI memory market.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first individual to reach a net worth exceeding $500 billion, driven by the rising valuations of Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. This milestone solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest person, significantly surpassing rivals like Oracle founder Larry Ellison. His immense wealth is primarily linked to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have seen a sharp increase this year. Investors have reportedly welcomed Musk's increased focus on his companies over political engagements, with the company's board outlining a potential $1 trillion pay package tied to ambitious future targets.</p>

          <p>Renault is reportedly in discussions with China's Chery to produce cars together in South America, specifically in Colombia and Argentina. The potential deal would grant Chery access to Renault's existing factory network, with Chery providing capital and product design. Plans include manufacturing combustion-engine cars at Renault's Envigado plant in Colombia, mostly rebadged as Renaults, and investing in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at the Córdoba factory in Argentina. These talks, initiated under Renault's former CEO, now involve Chery potentially fully funding the projects, reflecting a cautious stance on spending by Renault's current leadership.</p>

The group allegedly trespassed in the landmark's vicinity and tried to affix a banner to one of the 'O's. Law enforcement detained the individuals without incident, and the Los Angeles Police Department shared a photo showing a portion of the banner, which appeared to include a green-and-white pill capsule. The specific message or purpose behind the attempted banner display remains unclear. City park rangers have taken over the investigation.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in funding intended to protect New York City's transportation system from terrorist attacks. Citing the city's history of terror threats, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan stated that New York is likely to prove the Trump administration improperly withheld funds to punish the state for not cooperating with its deportation program. This ruling comes as the Trump administration also slashed federal counterterrorism funding for the NYPD. The judge emphasized that the grant program was established based on terrorism risk, and New York faces unique vulnerabilities.</p>

Miraculously, no injuries were reported despite the extensive damage and debris scattered across Alexander Avenue. Mayor Eric Adams praised the fortunate outcome, emphasizing the avoidance of a major disaster. Officials believe the blast originated in the boiler room, sending shockwaves up the chimney and leading to the structural failure. Residents from 38 apartments have been evacuated, and inspections are underway to ensure the building's structural integrity, with gas services temporarily shut off.</p>

This inventive response followed critical remarks from former NFL coach Rex Ryan regarding Sanders' previous comments about his NFL backup status. Sanders, a former college star, was drafted by the Browns in the fifth round, behind Gabriel, and now sits third on the depth chart behind Gabriel and veteran Joe Flacco.</p>
