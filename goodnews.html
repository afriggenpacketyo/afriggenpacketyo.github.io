          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples' dynamics has identified the five most common issues that lead to conflict in relationships. These include tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, communication styles, and finances. Contempt, often expressed through tone, is a major predictor of divorce, while disagreements about family often reflect unmet needs and value clashes. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication styles also contribute significantly to relationship conflicts, according to research and clinical observations.</p>
