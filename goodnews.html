          <h2>American Airlines CFO Notes Some Travelers Avoiding Newark Airport Due to Disruptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 15:22:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines CFO Devon May mentioned that some travelers are opting for alternative airports like LaGuardia, JFK, or Philadelphia to avoid recent disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. This shift is occurring as the FAA has ordered temporary flight cuts at Newark to alleviate congestion caused by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has further exacerbated these issues in recent weeks. The impact on American Airlines is considered modest, but the trend highlights ongoing challenges at Newark Airport. Optimism score is based on a relatively stable situation, as it is a relatively minor disruption to airport traffic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, 2025, to commemorate its 250th birthday, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will showcase military equipment from different eras, including World War II airplanes, Vietnam War-era helicopters, and modern tanks. A notable participant will be an Australian Cattle Dog named Doc Holliday, who belongs to the Army's 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment and is accustomed to parades. The event aims to strengthen the connection between America and its Army, despite costing an estimated $45 million. The optimism score is reasonably stable, as the parade is designed to boost morale and celebrate history.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Factors such as easing trade tensions and concerns over U.S. sovereign debt have also contributed to the surge. Bitcoin ETFs have seen steady inflows, and the number of bitcoins held by public companies has grown significantly. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration, including the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's openness to allowing clients to buy Bitcoin, have further bolstered the market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An auction of Abraham Lincoln's personal belongings, held to fund payments on a loan taken out by the Lincoln Presidential Foundation, saw significant interest in several items. A pair of bloodstained leather gloves that were in Lincoln's pocket the night he was assassinated sold for $1.52 million. Other items, including a handkerchief and a "wanted" poster for John Wilkes Booth, also fetched high prices. The auction raised a total of $7.9 million, highlighting the enduring historical significance and public interest in artifacts related to the former president. The optimism score is somewhat stable, as the auction itself is a historical event and does not involve any new loss of life.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 15:10:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports to the U.S. led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. The strict drug control policy, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimated that without China's restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the positive impact of the embargo but also the ongoing opioid crisis.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 15:03:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a budget package that includes a provision to lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, potentially providing tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or significant state income tax liabilities. The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000, with a phaseout for higher earners. High-income homeowners are most likely to benefit from the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that the $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses whether an annuity can run out of money, explaining that it depends on the type of annuity. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent, guaranteeing income for life. However, fixed-term annuities, variable annuities, and indexed annuities can run out of money under certain circumstances. The article provides strategies to protect against losing annuity payments, such as choosing a lifetime income annuity, adding an income rider, diversifying retirement income, researching the insurance company, and watching withdrawal habits.

Anthropic stopped investing in chatbots at the end of last year and has instead focused on improving Claude's ability to do complex tasks like research and coding, even writing whole code bases.
