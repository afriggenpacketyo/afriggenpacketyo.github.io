        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a significant increase in sales in Australia for May, despite facing declining sales in the U.S. and Europe. Vehicle sales jumped to 3,897, driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, with Model Y sales soaring 122.5% year-over-year. While total deliveries in Australia were up 9.3% year-over-year, they surged over 675% from April. Despite this rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared with the same period last year, indicating that while the local market is strong, a broader global recovery is not yet apparent.

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated in Cologne, Germany, as experts worked to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation involved closing off large areas of the city center, including the old city, hotels, care homes, and train stations. The weapons, manufactured in the US, were discovered in the Deutz district. Cologne was heavily targeted during WWII, making bomb defusals a common occurrence, with this operation being one of the largest in recent years. The incident serves as a reminder of the lasting impact of historical conflicts.</p>

Muncy redeemed himself with a game-tying home run in the ninth, setting up Freddie Freeman's walk-off double in the tenth. Muncy's recent offensive surge has helped offset his defensive struggles, providing him with leeway to improve his fielding, while his offensive production has been crucial for the Dodgers.</p>
