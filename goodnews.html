          <p>Primary school teacher Alice Cole returned to her job part-time after having her first child, emphasizing the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents in addressing teacher recruitment and retention issues. Cole believes that offering flexible options will allow teachers to feel confident in balancing their personal and professional lives, and the government is attempting to improve flexible hours as part of its pledge to recruit new teachers. The overall number of teachers has fallen, with fewer entering the profession, and computer science teacher Sam Alner highlights the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance in teaching, leading experienced staff to seek better opportunities elsewhere. Schools in disadvantaged areas struggle to recruit teachers, limiting opportunities for pupils in specialist subjects, highlighting the need to address inequalities in education. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and enabling them to see infrared light. The nanowire implants convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, and the study, published in Science, offers significant promise for treating human blindness. This advance could potentially provide humans with the ability to see beyond the visible spectrum. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, found that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making this issue especially urgent. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and highlighted the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women. </p>

          <p>Nutritionists are cautioning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may be a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors. While intermittent fasting is often touted for weight loss and health benefits, it can lead to restrictive eating and obsessive thoughts about food. Experts emphasize that individuals with a history of eating disorders or those genetically and environmentally vulnerable are at higher risk. They recommend intuitive eating, which focuses on balanced meals, variety, and listening to the body's hunger and fullness cues, rather than adhering to rigid food rules. </p>
