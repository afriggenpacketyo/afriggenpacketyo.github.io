          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump amid the president's calls for lower interest rates. The Fed confirmed the meeting, emphasizing that future monetary policy was not discussed, except to stress that policy decisions would depend entirely on incoming economic data and objective analysis. Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to setting monetary policy based on careful, objective, and non-political analysis, a move to push back on Trump's pressure. This was their first meeting since Trump began his second term, and comes amid tariff uncertainty and market expectations for the Fed to hold steady on rates until at least September.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an 8-0 decision, the Supreme Court has placed new limits on federally mandated environmental impact statements for major projects, potentially expediting infrastructure approvals. The ruling, in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, concerns the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its application to a proposed railway linking Utah and Colorado. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, stated that NEPA should impose only a modest procedural requirement related to the project at hand, not a mandatory study of far-reaching upstream or downstream impacts. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser expressed concerns about the project's risks to Colorado's water resources, while proponents argue the rail line will boost the economy and lower energy prices.</p>

          <p>Eight large, colorful snake statues have been erected around Geneva as part of the Strike Out Snakebite initiative, aiming to raise awareness of venomous snakebite as a major global health problem. The initiative, launched at the World Health Forum, seeks to ensure that every adult and child needing antivenom receives it promptly. Each year, roughly 140,000 people die from snakebite envenoming, and millions more suffer injuries or long-term disabilities. The goal is to put snakebite back on the map and highlight the need for investment in treatment and prevention.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Some Glacial Ice Loss Is Inevitable, but Mitigation Can Help</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that significant glacial ice loss is inevitable over the next few centuries, even if global temperatures stabilize. Researchers found that glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose about one-third of their mass even if temperatures remained at current levels. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could save twice as much ice compared to a 2.7-degree Celsius warming scenario. The study emphasizes that every tenth of a degree less of warming will help preserve glacial ice and prevent the most severe consequences.</p>
