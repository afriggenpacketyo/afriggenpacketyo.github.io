          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to advance divisive political issues. Conservatives often file challenges against the Biden administration in small Texas courts, ensuring Republican appointees make the initial rulings. Conversely, liberals tend to file cases in larger venues within the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to dictate policy nationwide, potentially impacting future injunctions and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. The article highlights the growing concern that the court system is becoming increasingly politicized.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. The GDP data was worse than economists anticipated, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies. While domestic demand showed a positive growth of 0.6%, the Bank of Japan remains cautious, warning of potential moderation in the economy due to global trade policies. Despite inflation surpassing the BOJ's target, the central bank is expected to maintain current rates until greater certainty emerges.</p>

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is not fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, despite the acting administrator's claims that the agency is about 80-85% ready. The review cites staffing limitations, hiring issues, and a lack of coordination with states as potential challenges. The acting administrator, David Richardson, emphasized that FEMA's focus is on empowering states and ensuring federal assistance is coordinated when necessary. This shift reflects President Trump's vision for a leaner FEMA, though morale within the agency is reportedly low due to concerns about its future.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050, according to research published in PLOS One.

The study does not pinpoint a specific cause for this surge, but it notes that the country is already struggling with challenges related to its rapidly aging population.

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Traditional fishing methods have led to numerous whale injuries and deaths, prompting the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to shorten the season. Some fishermen, like Brand Little, are using high-tech pop-up systems to reduce rope usage and prevent whale entanglements, though these systems are expensive and face resistance from traditionalists. The situation highlights the need for innovative solutions to balance economic interests with environmental protection.</p>

These migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges happening in both directions.

          <p>The Trump administration has approved an agreement for the United Arab Emirates to build the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the United States, a move that gives the UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips. This decision reverses previous restrictions under the Biden administration, which feared China could access the technology. The campus, supported by 5 gigawatts of power, will be built by Abu Dhabi state-backed firm G42, with American companies operating the data centers. The agreement includes commitments from the UAE to align its national security regulations with the US and prevent technology diversion.</p>

          <h2>Army Anniversary Parade on Trump's Birthday Estimated to Cost Millions</h2>

          <p>A military parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary, scheduled to coincide with President Trump's birthday, is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The event, planned for Washington, D.C., will involve over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. The White House states that the cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. The plans have drawn criticism from Democrats, who view the parade as a wasteful display of ego.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Decision to Lift Syria Sanctions Surprises Treasury Staff</h2>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise, lacking specific details about which measures would be rolled back. The announcement followed months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief. The new government has cited sanctions as a barrier to paying civil service salaries and rebuilding the war-ravaged country. Discussions are underway at Treasury to determine the scope and pace of the rollback, which could involve waivers under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.</p>
