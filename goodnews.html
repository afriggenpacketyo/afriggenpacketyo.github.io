          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball. Despite a performance that manager Dave Roberts described as not their best, the team managed to secure the win. Key moments included home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy, and a crucial game-ending double-play induced by closer Tanner Scott with the bases loaded. The victory highlights the team's ability to win games even when not playing at their peak potential, continuing their successful run.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World zoo in Shirahama, Japan, have been returned to China as their loan agreement expired. The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled for return. The Wakayama zoo had a successful joint breeding program with a Chinese research base since 1994, raising 17 cubs. This event brings China's "panda diplomacy" into focus, marking a potential end to an era of panda presence in Japan.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Traditional Japanese Diet May Be Linked to Lower Rates of Depression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 20:55:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, was assessed among nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those rich in omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between this dietary pattern and mental health.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. At least 16 people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates, as an extensive multi-agency manhunt continues for the final fugitive.</p>

          <p>As antibiotic resistance grows into a "silent pandemic," scientists are revisiting a century-old idea: using bacteriophages, or "phages," to treat infections. Phages are viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, offering a potential alternative to antibiotics for incurable superbugs. A project at the University of Southampton is actively collecting phage samples from the public to build a library for potential medical use. While phage therapy is not yet mainstream, the UK's drug regulator has published rules to support its development, signaling a renewed interest in this approach to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Using a unique P-band radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate foliage and clouds to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. The initial images are already revealing hidden wetlands and previously concealed deforestation. Over the coming years, the data will be used to create a global 3D map of forests, enabling scientists to more accurately estimate their role in mitigating climate change and helping authorities to monitor illegal logging.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order that sought to punish the law firm Susman Godfrey, calling the order "unconstitutional from beginning to end." This is the fourth time a federal court has struck down one of the president's orders targeting elite law firms for representing clients or causes he opposes. The punitive orders have included measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. The series of judicial rebukes represents a significant check on what judges have described as an unprecedented executive attack on the independence of the legal profession.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage for the first time in over a year to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a performance described as slick and crowd-pleasing but ultimately safe. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his on-stage antics, was more subdued, and the set largely functioned as a greatest hits collection. While musically tight, the show lacked the wilder, punk energy seen in past performances. Healy also noted a deliberate move away from political commentary for the night, stating the band wants its legacy to be about love and friendship rather than politics.</p>

          <p>The small, remote village of Kwethluk, Alaska, recently became a pilgrimage site for the canonization of Matushka Olga, the first Yup'ik Orthodox Christian saint. Hundreds of clergy and pilgrims from around the world gathered for the two-day glorification ceremony for the local midwife and healer, who died in 1979. Remembered for her compassion and for miracles attributed to her after her death, her canonization marks a significant moment for the region's strong Orthodox tradition. The ceremonies blended traditional Orthodox rites with the local Yugtun language, honoring the new saint's indigenous heritage.</p>
