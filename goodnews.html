          <h2>BBC Salary Disclosures Obscure True Earnings of Top Stars</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:18:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual salary report reveals top earners like Gary Lineker but fails to provide a complete picture of star compensation. Many high-profile presenters and actors are not on the list because they are paid through independent production companies or the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios. This arrangement, intended to maintain a competitive market, means the publicly funded figures do not reflect the full earnings of talent on popular shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" or "The Traitors." The article explains this discrepancy is due to complex funding and production models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its markets and banking divisions. The bank reported earnings of $1.96 per share on revenue of $21.67 billion, outperforming analyst estimates. This positive report comes as CEO Jane Fraser continues to implement a strategic turnaround plan, which includes streamlining international operations. The strong performance, particularly during a period of market volatility, has contributed to a significant rise in the company's stock value this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has disclosed the existence of a secret £400 million scheme, the Afghan Response Route, created to relocate thousands of Afghans whose personal data was compromised in a major Ministry of Defence leak. The data breach in 2022 inadvertently exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation, putting them at risk from the Taliban. So far, 4,500 people have been resettled in the UK through this confidential program, the existence of which was hidden by a court injunction until a recent High Court ruling allowed for its reporting.</p>

          <p>At a high-level meeting, China's top leadership has declared a fundamental shift in the country's urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion towards enhancing existing urban areas. With 67% of its population now urbanized, the new focus will be on optimizing city planning, improving human well-being, and renovating older districts and dilapidated housing. This change reflects an acknowledgment that the era of rapid, sprawling growth is over. The policy shift aims to create a new, more sustainable model for the property sector and improve urban governance.</p>

          <p>Researchers from China utilized publicly available satellite data from NASA to identify promising locations for deep-sea mineral mining in the Indian Ocean. The data, from the GRACE satellites which map Earth's gravity field, revealed anomalies along the Ninety East Ridge indicating areas with a thicker, denser crust. These geological features suggest a higher concentration of valuable minerals like copper, nickel, and cobalt, which are pushed up from the mantle. This use of open-source American scientific data has potentially saved the Chinese research effort significant time and resources in their search for undersea resources.</p>

          <p>To accelerate the shift from gasoline and diesel cars, the UK government is launching a new grant program offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new electric vehicles. The scheme, funded with £650 million over three years, applies to eligible car models priced up to £37,000. The Department for Transport aims to make EVs more affordable for consumers ahead of the 2030 ban on new internal combustion engine car sales. While the move is welcomed by some manufacturers, critics argue that the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure remains a significant barrier to widespread EV adoption.</p>

In his statement, CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results but reiterated his persistent warnings about significant economic risks, including trade uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and high fiscal deficits.

The plan aims to replace an aging and costly ferry service, boosting the local economy and improving connectivity for residents and businesses on islands like Unst, the UK's most northerly inhabited area. Proponents, including local industries and the council leader, believe the tunnels could be "incredibly transformational." The project is currently in a feasibility study phase, with a funding model likely to involve borrowing and user tolls, similar to the Faroese system.</p>

          <p>This personal essay recounts the author's journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church tradition due to its rigid opposition to same-sex marriage. Raised in the Southern Baptist Convention, the author describes the painful choice between lifelong celibacy and leaving her beloved community, a dilemma framed by the church as a test of faithfulness. Ultimately, she found that her spiritual integrity required her to leave, and in doing so, she discovered a deeper, more affirming Christianity that embraces her sexuality. The author argues that for many LGBTQ Christians, affirming their identity is a sincere religious conviction.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, a pastor and divinity school professor argues that churches should refrain from endorsing political candidates, despite a recent IRS rule change allowing them to do so. While acknowledging the historical necessity for the church, particularly the Black church, to address political and moral issues like injustice, he draws a firm line at candidate endorsements. He contends that such actions reduce the church's role, undermine the conscience of congregants, and risk turning houses of worship into politically polarized spaces.
