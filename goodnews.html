          <p>A provision in a new budget bill establishes "Trump accounts," government-seeded investment vehicles for children born between 2025 and 2028. These accounts will receive an initial $1,000 government contribution, with parents and employers able to contribute additional post-tax funds. While financial experts see the initial grant as "free money," they note that existing options like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer better tax advantages for specific goals like education or retirement. The accounts are designed to encourage early investment, with funds growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell announced it is exploring strategic alternatives for its productivity solutions (PSS) and warehouse solutions (WWS) units, boosting its stock price. This move is part of a larger effort to streamline its portfolio and focus on higher-growth areas ahead of its planned three-way split into automation, aerospace, and advanced materials companies. The decision follows pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which had highlighted underperformance in these specific units. The potential sale could provide Honeywell with cash for more accretive acquisitions, continuing its recent trend of portfolio reshaping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Decline to Pre-Tariff Levels, NY Fed Survey Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 13:22:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about tariff-driven inflation have subsided. In June, respondents' one-year inflation expectation fell to 3%, matching the level from before the Trump administration's trade policy announcements and down from a peak of 3.6% in the spring. This data aligns with a period of more conciliatory trade negotiations and suggests that widespread price hikes have not yet materialized in official inflation readings. However, the survey still shows expectations for price increases in specific areas like medical care, college, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a 2-1 loss to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final, the U.S. Men's National Team's performance is being viewed as a strategic success for coach Mauricio Pochettino. The tournament was less about winning and more about evaluating the team's character and depth a year before the World Cup. Pochettino fielded a young, inexperienced roster, challenging them to prove their commitment, and the team reached the final undefeated. This process allowed new players to emerge as contenders for the World Cup squad, injecting a new sense of hunger and redefining what it means to play for the national team.</p>

          <p>In Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, Catholics honored Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a customs worker recently beatified by the Vatican. Kositi was murdered in 2007 after he refused a bribe to allow tainted rice to cross the border, and Pope Francis recognized him as a martyr of the faith. His remains were transferred to a cathedral in a special Mass, celebrated by hundreds as a symbol of hope and integrity in a region plagued by conflict and corruption. The beatification is seen as a powerful call to action against corruption and a sign of hope for peace in eastern Congo.</p>

The $23 million initiative aims to train educators on how to effectively and ethically use artificial intelligence in the classroom. AFT President Randi Weingarten stated the goal is to harness AI to enhance teaching and learning while keeping teachers in control, rather than being replaced by technology. The academy will offer free virtual training to all 1.8 million union members, with a goal of training 400,000 educators in person over five years.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, Waymo, has launched a new service allowing teenagers aged 14 to 17 to hail driverless rides. The program, starting in Phoenix, requires a parent to invite their teen to a paired account, after which the teen can request rides independently. The service includes safety features such as specially-trained support agents and the ability for parents to track trips in real-time. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to increase ridership as it expands its service to more U.S. cities and faces pressure to monetize its AI technology.</p>

Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for "not treating human beings right" and attacking civilian areas.

          <p>A new survey suggests many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their financial habits based on feelings about the economy. This has led to a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," as economic anxiety fuels a desire to build emergency funds. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions and recommend a more intentional approach. They suggest savers start by assessing their financial situation, using "reverse budgeting" to prioritize savings goals first, and automating contributions to appropriate accounts for long-term security.</p>
