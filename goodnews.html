          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio conducted his first official meeting with the families of the 50 remaining hostages held by the Hamas terror group in Gaza. During the meeting in Washington, D.C., Rubio reaffirmed the Trump administration's commitment to securing the release of all captives. The families, including relatives of Omri Miran and Eitan Horn, urged for a single, comprehensive deal to bring everyone home, emphasizing that this is a critical window of opportunity. They expressed their trust in the administration's ability to act with urgency and make the brave decisions necessary to end the crisis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by a potential new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, Germany is planning to build the largest military in Europe. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced plans to increase defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, a substantial rise from previous levels. This will be facilitated by a $117 billion special fund and a constitutional change to suspend the country's 'debt brake,' allowing for nearly $400 billion in defense spending through 2029 without cutting social programs. The move reflects a profound change in Germany's post-war identity, aiming to meet the demands of its NATO partners for greater security responsibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article critiques conservative gay figures like Richard Grenell for promoting respectability politics and attempting to create divisions within the LGBTQ+ community. The author argues that the spirit of Pride has always been rooted in diversity and progress, driven by the community's most marginalized members, such as the drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals who initiated the Stonewall Riots. The piece asserts that historical progress was never achieved by conforming to heteronormative standards. It concludes that attempts to sideline transgender issues or flamboyant expression betray the foundational, inclusive spirit of the gay rights movement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political victory, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries from the city's conservative, MAGA-aligned council. Measure A rejected a council-created board that would have censored children's books, while Measure B blocked the potential privatization of the library system. This outcome is viewed as a powerful rebuke of the council's overreach and a demonstration of how a nonpartisan, grassroots coalition can successfully push back against extremist politics. Organizers hope their success in a traditionally conservative city can serve as a model for community activism elsewhere.</p>

The event has become a symbol of resistance against the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, drawing support from over 30 embassies and members of the European Parliament.

The 39-year-old, who recently worked with a sports psychologist to rekindle his love for the sport, stated this is a "new beginning" for him.

          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China holds a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. He argues that third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay already function in a manner similar to stablecoins, acting as an extension of legal tender with a mature regulatory framework. These platforms maintain a 1:1 peg with fiat currency, backed by central bank money and strict oversight. As the global debate on stablecoins intensifies, this existing infrastructure could position China to stay ahead of the curve in digital currency innovation. (not investment advice)</p>
