          <h2>Supreme Court Blocks Deportation of Venezuelan Migrants Under Wartime Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 00:24:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang under the Alien Enemies Act while the matter is litigated in the courts. The ruling suggested that a majority of the justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections. The justices sent the case back to an appeals court, directing it to examine the migrants' claims that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act and to consider how much notice the government should be required to provide migrants so they have an opportunity to challenge their deportations. The article also covers a New Jersey Transit strike that left commuters scrambling and the investigation of James Comey over a social media post.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article revisits the controversy surrounding Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about President Joe Biden's mental acuity. The report, based on interviews from October 2023, cited memory lapses and a halting tone in Biden's speech. Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy questioned Biden about the report's characterization of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." Biden responded defiantly, asserting his competence and dismissing the need for Hur's recommendation. The article also mentions the political fallout from the report, with Republicans seizing on it to question Biden's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, significantly reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the region. The storm, driven by winds of 60 to 70 mph over dry farmlands, caused near-zero visibility in some areas, forcing drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and halting flights at Midway International Airport for about an hour. The dust storm also impacted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois, where attendees experienced blowing debris and dirt. While dust storm warnings are more common in rural parts of central and southern Illinois, this event marked the first time such a warning included the city of Chicago itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, including standing ovations, pledges of billions of dollars in American investments, and the UAE's highest civilian honor. Trump announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the United States and the three nations, each longtime purchasers of American military equipment. In contrast to the backlash over his tariff policies and domestic controversies at home, Trump's visit to the Arabian Peninsula was largely positive, with gulf leaders praising his shift toward peace and profit in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>As the United States reduces its investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is significantly increasing its economic and strategic involvement on the continent. Through powerhouse Emirati corporations, the UAE is investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, critical minerals, and renewable energy projects. This expansion is part of a broader plan to increase the country's influence over global supply chains and diversify its economy away from fossil fuels. While the US and other Western nations are reducing their financial commitments, the UAE is stepping in to fill the void, becoming a dominant foreign player in many African nations.</p>

Christian D√ºrr, the party's former parliamentary leader, succeeded Lindner as FDP chairman.
