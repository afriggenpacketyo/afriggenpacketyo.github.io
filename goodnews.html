          <p>This article discusses the market's response to President Trump's tariff policies, highlighting the rise of "Taco trades." The term "Taco," short for "Trump always chickens out," reflects investors' strategy of selling assets when Trump threatens high tariffs and rebuying them when he backs down. Despite this trend, many investors still trust in "Tina," or "there is no alternative," when putting their money in US assets. The article examines the market's appetite for both Taco trades and the underlying belief in the strength of US assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is on track to receive bonuses worth over ‚Ç¨100 million after the airline's shares hit a key performance target. The payout, potentially one of the largest in European corporate history, hinges on Ryanair's share price remaining above ‚Ç¨21 for a sustained period. O'Leary must also remain with the airline until July 2028 to fully vest the share options. Ryanair emphasized that the bonus is contingent on both the share price target and O'Leary's continued employment. (not investment advice)</p>
