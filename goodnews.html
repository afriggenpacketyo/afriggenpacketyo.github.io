          <h2>10-Year Treasury Yield Increases Following Fed's Rate Decision and Strong GDP Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:08:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold interest rates steady, a decision that was widely anticipated by the market. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed by approximately 2 basis points to 4.35%, reacting to both the Fed's announcement and a stronger-than-expected second-quarter GDP report showing 3% growth. Investors are now closely watching Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming press conference for any signals regarding future monetary policy. The stability in rates comes amidst ongoing calls from President Trump for the central bank to implement cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. This decision came despite significant pressure from President Trump for aggressive cuts and was marked by a rare divided vote, with two officials dissenting in favor of easing policy. The committee's statement noted a moderation in economic growth and persistent uncertainty, signaling a less optimistic outlook than in previous months. Markets are now anticipating a potential rate cut at the next meeting in September, pending further economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:05:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid record-high credit card balances nationwide, this article details the conditions under which consumers might qualify for credit card debt forgiveness programs. These programs can potentially reduce a borrower's debt by 30% to 50% but are not available to everyone. Eligibility typically hinges on demonstrating genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or significant medical expenses, and having a substantial amount of unsecured debt, often $7,500 or more. Borrowers who have already fallen behind on payments may also have more leverage in negotiations, as creditors prefer recovering some funds over a total loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent manned submersible voyage into the deep-sea trenches of the northwest Pacific Ocean has revealed extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at depths over 31,000 feet. This discovery challenges previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme environments characterized by immense pressure and a lack of sunlight. Researchers believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down, but on chemicals produced by microbes that process carbon accumulated in the trench over time. The finding suggests that such complex ecosystems in the planet's deepest points may be more common than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Meta's quarterly earnings report, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, focusing on the concept of "personal superintelligence." He described this as a tool for individual empowerment, contrasting it with industry approaches that aim to automate work and place humanity on a universal dole. This vision follows Meta's multi-billion dollar investment in AI talent and infrastructure, including the creation of a new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit. The move echoes Zuckerberg's previous heavy investment in the metaverse, which has so far resulted in significant financial losses for the company's Reality Labs division.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged businesses and investors not to panic if new trade deals are not finalized by President Trump's August 1 deadline. He clarified that the date is a negotiating tactic and that countries can continue to seek agreements even after higher tariff rates potentially take effect. Bessent explained that failure to reach a deal by the deadline would simply revert a country's tariff level to the reciprocal rate announced in April, which could be in place for a variable period. He anticipates a "busy August" of trade negotiations as the administration pressures partners to accept new terms.</p>

          <p>This article explores the role of annuities for retirees who already receive Social Security benefits, framing them as a potential tool to supplement income and hedge against outliving savings. While Social Security provides a steady income, it's often insufficient to cover all expenses, making the guaranteed income from an annuity an attractive option for risk-averse individuals. However, the article cautions that annuities involve locking up capital, which can limit financial flexibility for emergencies, and may come with complex terms and fees. The decision depends heavily on an individual's health, risk tolerance, and overall financial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

A key underlying metric, final sales to private domestic purchasers, rose at a much weaker 1.2% rate, suggesting that underlying demand is slowing.
