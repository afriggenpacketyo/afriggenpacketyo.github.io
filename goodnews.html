Despite a 1% decline in global unit case volume, the company's organic revenue increased by 5%. The beverage giant narrowed its full-year earnings per share growth outlook to 3% and reiterated its 2025 organic revenue forecast.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing open seating policy, announcing that passengers can begin booking flights with assigned seats starting July 29, for travel commencing January 27, 2026. This change aims to offer customers new options, including extra legroom, and reduce boarding uncertainty. The airline also recently modified its "bags fly free" policy, indicating a broader shift in its revenue strategy. The new boarding process will group passengers by seat location, prioritizing certain fare types and loyalty members.</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a Member of the Senedd (MS), has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform, becoming the latter's first MS and highest-profile defection in Wales. Jones stated she could no longer justify Conservative policies, with her former party learning of the move as the announcement unfolded. Reform leader Nigel Farage welcomed her experience, as recent polls suggest Reform could become the largest party in the upcoming Senedd election. Jones denied the move was driven by re-election concerns.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, affirming its full-year guidance despite the ongoing uncertainty from President Trump's auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the automaker is working to "greatly reduce" its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. Tariffs impacted GM's Q2 by $1.1 billion, and the company expects slower demand for electric vehicles after the expiration of tax credits. GM is also investing $4 billion in U.S. plants to counter tariff risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its next-generation high-speed rail technology, achieving speeds exceeding 350km/h by innovating train head shapes and undercarriage designs to significantly reduce aerodynamic resistance and energy consumption. This development contrasts sharply with the United States, where federal funding for California's high-speed rail project has been revoked. The divergent approaches highlight differing national priorities and investment strategies in advanced transportation infrastructure, with China pushing technological boundaries while the US pulls back from similar ambitious projects.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has reportedly surpassed tech giants like Elon Musk and Tim Cook in political influence within the Trump administration, particularly concerning US-China trade policy.

This shift highlights the growing importance of AI chips in the global tech landscape and Huang's strategic navigation of political complexities.

          <p>New research from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that 11% of Trump voters, primarily working-class individuals, could be swayed back to the Democratic Party. The study indicates these voters are "economic egalitarians" who support populist economic policies like raising the minimum wage and protecting jobs, but hold more socially moderate views than the Democratic Party's current base. The article proposes a "social populism" strategy, combining a worker-focused economic agenda with an embrace of working-class social attitudes, as the key to building a durable Democratic majority.</p>
