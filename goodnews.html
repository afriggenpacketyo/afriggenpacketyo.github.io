          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive Eiji Hashimoto expressed confidence that the U.S. government's role in its $14.1 billion buyout of U.S. Steel will not hinder the U.S. unit's business operations. Hashimoto highlighted the $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government as rational conditions, emphasizing that restricting their activities would prevent the revival of U.S. Steel. Under the national security agreement, a U.S. president or designated official can approve management decisions, including facility closures; Hashimoto believes this deal will benefit both companies and help revive the U.S. steel industry. Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel makes it the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, increasing its global capacity and aiming for expansion in overseas markets.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in Central London in 2021. The frescoes, originating from at least 20 walls of a luxurious Roman villa, feature detailed paintings of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit. The artwork provides insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," and suggests the villa may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers. The team hopes to find the missing piece with the artist's name, as they believe the frescoes were created by skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. President Donald Trump imposing tariffs, businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to legally reduce their duty liabilities. This practice involves modifying an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum, or hoodie makers switching to cotton to save on duty costs. The practice can be traced back to 1882, and has been ruled legal as long as goods are honestly exposed to customs officers; however, some sectors face challenges due to extensive regulations and the need for certifications and validation.</p>
