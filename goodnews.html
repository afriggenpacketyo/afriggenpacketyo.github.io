        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Announcing a major trade agreement with Japan, President Trump stated the deal includes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. The agreement, which Trump called potentially the largest ever, also involves a purported $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The announcement followed tense negotiations and came after Japan's ruling coalition lost its majority, with the deal providing a potential political boost for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japanese auto stocks surged in response to the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced significant gains following reports of a new U.S.-Japan trade agreement. The deal reportedly lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, providing a major boost to Japan's auto industry, which is a cornerstone of its economy. Toyota's stock jumped over 11%, while Mazda surged more than 17%, reflecting market relief and optimism after a period of uncertainty over potential tariff hikes. The positive market reaction underscores the economic importance of auto exports to the United States for Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade deals with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. Following a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., President Trump stated that the Philippines would become an "open market" with zero tariffs on U.S. goods. A similar agreement with Indonesia will see it eliminate tariffs on 99% of its trade with the U.S. in exchange for the 19% tariff on its exports. These deals are part of the administration's broader strategy ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to reach new trade terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a history stretching back 250 years. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that served in the American War of Independence, it was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology and archival research conducted by archaeologists and local community members. The discovery has excited the local population, who helped recover the timbers, providing a tangible link to the island's rich maritime past.</p>
