          <p>Alphabet's Waymo has secured approval to broaden its autonomous ride-hailing service to include San Jose and more areas within the San Francisco Bay Area. The California Public Utilities Commission approved Waymo's passenger safety plan, paving the way for driverless operations from San Francisco down through the Peninsula. While immediate changes to operations are not expected, Waymo expressed excitement about bringing its Waymo One service to more of the Bay Area in the future. This expansion marks a significant step for autonomous vehicle technology and its integration into urban transportation.</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to understand why our Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan constructing advanced detectors to study neutrinos, sub-atomic particles. The current theory of the Universe's origin cannot explain the existence of planets, stars, and galaxies. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) and the Japanese-led Hyper-K aim to identify differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, which could explain why matter prevailed over antimatter. Discoveries from these experiments are expected to transform our understanding of the Universe and humanity's place within it.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has agreed to compensate hundreds of former sub-postmasters whose personal details were accidentally leaked on its corporate website, with individual payouts of up to ¬£5,000. The data breach, which occurred in June of last year, exposed the names and addresses of 555 victims of the Horizon IT scandal. The law firm Freeths, representing the sub-postmasters, secured the payouts, though some victims believe they are entitled to further compensation. Former sub-postmaster Chris Head welcomed the move but emphasized that it took "far too long to right this wrong."</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's announcement of an "aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis, experts explain that it's not uncommon for older patients to receive such diagnoses at later stages. Several factors could contribute, including a decision to forgo PSA-based screening, rapid cancer growth between screenings, borderline screening results, or absence of symptoms. Experts emphasize that recent advances have greatly improved treatment outcomes, even for advanced cases. While prostate cancer diagnoses like Biden's are serious, they are increasingly manageable with modern medical advancements.</p>

Early prostate cancer often has no symptoms, but advanced stages can cause urinary problems, erectile dysfunction, and pain.
