          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a U.S. initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a Biden-era decision that had blocked the controversial Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road through Alaskan wilderness. While the company celebrated the renewed federal commitment, environmental groups and local communities have raised concerns about the project's potential harm to the landscape and wildlife.

          <p>While clearing their yard, a New Orleans couple made a remarkable archaeological discovery: a flat marble slab that turned out to be an ancient Roman grave marker. After contacting university experts, the headstone was identified as belonging to a second-century Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus. The artifact was reported missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, which was heavily damaged during World War II. The discovery has initiated an effort to repatriate the stone to Italy, with the FBI's art crime team now involved in the process of returning the long-lost relic.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced a phased restart of production at its UK and Slovakian manufacturing sites, which have been idle since a serious cyberattack in early September. The resumption will begin at its engine and battery plants, with vehicle assembly lines to follow. In response to the financial strain the shutdown has caused, JLR has also launched a program to accelerate payments to its critical suppliers, many of whom had been forced to lay off workers. While the restart is a positive step, industry experts warn that it will likely take several weeks for production to return to normal levels.</p>

The move allows the Shenzhen-listed company to tap into a new pool of capital as it continues its global expansion. This filing occurs amid a challenging trade environment, as the Trump administration has rolled out new import tariffs on Chinese-made solar and energy storage equipment. Sungrow has maintained a leading position in the global solar inverter market for ten consecutive years, holding a 25.2% market share by shipment volume. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China is driving the global green energy revolution while the United States is being held back by its focus on fossil fuels. The article highlights that China's annual renewable energy additions have more than doubled in the last five years, far outpacing the U.S. despite incentives from the Biden administration. The author criticizes the U.S. for its high per capita carbon emissions and for policy uncertainty under the Trump administration, which threatens to freeze progress. The piece concludes that China's strategic investments are positioning it as the leader in the future of energy.</p>

          <p>In the UK's largest-ever operation against phone theft, police have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled a criminal network believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China annually. The investigation began after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow, leading police to uncover the international operation. The gang allegedly exported up to half of all phones stolen in London, where phone theft has nearly tripled in four years. Authorities state the high profitability of stolen devices in overseas markets, particularly China, is a major driver of this crime.</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center, located 35 meters below the sea's surface in Hainan province. The facility consists of large, sealed cabins containing server racks that are naturally cooled by the surrounding seawater, significantly reducing the energy consumption and operational costs associated with traditional land-based data centers. The project is a key component of Hainan's plan to develop its 'blue economy' by leveraging innovative marine technologies. The initial phase includes cabins capable of housing hundreds of servers each, with a long-term goal of installing 100 such units.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first of three consecutive supermoons in 2025 is set to appear on the night of October 7th. This full moon, known as the Harvest Moon, will be the largest and brightest of the year so far because its orbit will bring it to its closest point to Earth, a phenomenon known as perigee. The term 'supermoon' describes a full moon that appears up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than at other times. The Harvest Moon is named for its proximity to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers gathering crops.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition creates a unique dialogue between East and West by displaying artifacts from a 9th-century Tang dynasty shipwreck alongside Western artworks, including a Claude Monet painting of merchant ships. The curator was inspired to explore the shared essence of maritime culture, which, like art, transcends borders by facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas across the globe. The exhibition juxtaposes ancient Chinese ceramics and trade goods with Impressionist observations of seaside life, highlighting the enduring connections forged by global sea travel. This approach aims to show how art and artifacts can journey through diverse places, sharing their messages like wandering ships.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, a significant increase from its 4% prediction in April. The revision comes despite escalating trade tensions with the United States, as government stimulus measures and strong exports have helped support the Chinese economy. However, the report cautions that this momentum may not be sustained, projecting a slowdown to 4.2% growth in 2026 as Beijing is expected to reduce stimulus to manage public debt. The bank also noted persistent domestic challenges, including a slump in the real estate sector and weak consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>
