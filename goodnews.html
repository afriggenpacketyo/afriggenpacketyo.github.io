        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite will be unavailable on Apple devices due to Apple blocking a recent app update. This dispute follows a judge's ruling that limited Apple's commissions on in-app purchases, which Epic Games had hoped would allow Fortnite to return to the App Store. Apple claims it asked Epic to resubmit the update without the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting Fortnite in other regions. Analysts suggest Apple is using its market power to prevent Epic from benefiting globally from its legal win in the United States.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil activists who planned to glue themselves to a runway at Heathrow Airport have been spared jail terms after being convicted of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. The judge acknowledged that the activists caused no 'actual harm' or disruption, but criticized them for treating the trial as an 'extension of the protest'. The activists received either time served or suspended sentences. The activists were arrested and charged after video footage showed people cycling near a high barbed wire-topped fence close to passenger planes before dismounting and being approached by officers.</p>
