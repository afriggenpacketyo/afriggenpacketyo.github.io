          <p>Fans of the late heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne will have an opportunity to pay their final respects as his funeral cortege travels through his home city of Birmingham. The procession will pass along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge, a site that has become a memorial with numerous fan tributes. The public event, funded by Osbourne's family, precedes a private funeral and allows the family to witness the outpouring of support from his global fanbase. The city's Lord Mayor described Osbourne, who died at 76, as a "son of Birmingham" who put the city on the world map.</p>

          <p>On the final day of his visit to Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with First Minister John Swinney to discuss key economic issues, including U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky. Swinney aims to secure an exemption for the crucial Scottish export, which is a significant part of the UK's food and drink exports. The meeting follows discussions with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a dinner where the leaders reportedly spoke at length. After the political discussions, Trump will officially open a new course at his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, concluding a visit that blended business with diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <h2>Collectible Toy Craze Highlights the History of East Germany's Monchhichi Doll</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent viral popularity of collectible Labubu toys, fueled by celebrity collectors, has revived interest in their perceived ancestor, the Monchhichi doll. Originally created in Japan in 1974, the monkey-like doll became a global sensation in the 1980s. While popular in West Germany, it was unavailable in the communist East, which led to the creation of a local version called the Tiemi. Produced in the toy-making town of Sonneberg, the Tiemi became a beloved item throughout the Eastern Bloc but ceased production after German reunification, making original models sought-after collector's items today.</p>

          <h2>Barclays Exceeds Second-Quarter Profit Forecasts Driven by Investment Banking Success</h2>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by a 10% year-on-year income increase in its investment banking division, which capitalized on market volatility. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased trading activity related to recent global economic shifts, including new tariff policies. The results come as the bank continues its three-year strategic plan focused on cost savings and achieving higher, more stable returns for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as its top striker targets for the current transfer window. The club acknowledges the need to sell some existing players to generate funds for a new signing, a process that may extend until the transfer deadline. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell the 29-year-old Watkins, and Newcastle is also reportedly interested in the 22-year-old Sesko. United reportedly considers Villa's suggested £60m price for Watkins to be excessively high given his age and contract status.</p>

          <p>Experts in China are urging Beijing to actively shape its global image and strengthen its influence by controlling its own narrative and engaging more with other Asian nations. They argue that China must counteract a historically dominant Western discourse by leveraging new cultural symbols and promoting Asian values rooted in consensus-based politics. This call for a more proactive approach to soft power comes as global dynamics shift, with emerging economies seeking a greater role in global governance. The experts suggest that China should lead in shaping an Asian discourse with an open mindset, rather than imposing a pre-made narrative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant shift in global manufacturing supply chains, India has surpassed China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. market. According to research from Canalys, India-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports in the second quarter, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year. This surge is primarily attributed to Apple's accelerated manufacturing shift to India amid ongoing U.S.-China trade uncertainties. Conversely, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. has fallen sharply, highlighting a broader trend of companies diversifying production away from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized by former Indian cricketer Arun Lal, who helped him develop the mindset needed for professional success.
