          <h2>French Cinema Criticized for Lack of Films on Nation's Colonial and Slavery History</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the near-absence of France's colonial history and involvement in the slave trade from its national cinema, contrasting it with Hollywood's frequent depiction of American slavery. It highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" that are beginning to address these topics. Despite audience readiness and critical acclaim, these films struggle for mainstream recognition and are often marginalized by major festivals like Cannes, indicating a broader cultural reluctance to confront this past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since November, with analysts forecasting continued gains through 2025. The appreciation is attributed to China's resilient macroeconomic data and a growing investor concern over the sustainability of US government debt and fiscal policies. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs predict the yuan will break the 7 per dollar mark within six months, driven by shifting client sentiment on China's growth outlook and fading confidence in US economic exceptionalism.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At a recent tech conference, experts emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. Panelists argued that reliance on English-based models from major tech companies limits diverse perspectives and that nations, particularly in regions like ASEAN, should take ownership of their AI systems. The use of open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services were highlighted as key strategies to democratize AI development and foster a collective energy that benefits entire countries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. This divergence is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey focusing more on smaller, export-oriented firms that may be front-loading shipments to avoid US tariffs. Despite the positive production reading, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, suggesting potential headwinds and continued caution among business owners.

          <p>Two tropical systems are affecting Mexico's coasts, bringing heavy rainfall to the region.

Meanwhile, in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie strengthened into a hurricane off Mexico's southwest coast, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. Forecasters expect Flossie to remain offshore but to bring significant rainfall to several Mexican states through the week.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed significant housing reform legislation through the state legislature, aimed at speeding up construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and waive restrictions for other developments. Newsom forced the bills' passage by tying them to the state budget, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor groups to pass what experts call the most consequential reforms to CEQA in its history.</p>

Canadian officials framed the move as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed, with the White House hailing the outcome as a major victory.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and suggest potential therapeutic strategies that could simulate these effects to promote longevity.</p>
