        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has approved the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, marking a significant milestone for the country's aviation ambitions. This development occurs amid increasing U.S. export restrictions targeting China's access to key technologies. While this engine differs from those used in commercial jets, experts say its development reflects China's growing ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines. Li Gaiqi, the chief designer of the AES100, emphasized the importance of this achievement for China's aviation sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that leprosy existed in the Americas long before European explorers arrived, challenging previous beliefs that the disease was solely introduced by settlers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur discovered that Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a second species of bacteria, was responsible for leprosy in the Americas, with evidence suggesting it existed 1,000 years prior to European contact. This revelation changes the understanding of leprosy's history in the Americas, proving it was endemic among Indigenous populations. The study, which involved analyzing over 800 DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases, also suggests the possibility of unknown animal reservoirs for the disease.</p>

This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible and save parents ¬£500 a year, potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, with details to be outlined in next week's spending review. While welcomed by the education sector and anti-poverty organizations, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child limit, would be more effective.</p>

Members of the House Armed Services Committee questioned whether the money could be better spent on troops' barracks.
