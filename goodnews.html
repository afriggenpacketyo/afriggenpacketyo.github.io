          <p>The 190th edition of Oktoberfest officially began in Munich as Mayor Dieter Reiter tapped the first beer keg, declaring the festival open with the traditional cry of "O'zapft is!". The world-renowned beer and folk festival is expected to attract more than six million visitors over its two-week duration. Despite record-high prices for a mug of beer this year, the event remains a cornerstone of Bavarian culture and a major global tourist attraction, featuring numerous beer tents, amusement rides, and traditional food stalls.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects such as caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are a significant part of the local diet, valued as both a delicacy and a staple food. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects provide a crucial source of protein and vitamins in a country where traditional meat is often unaffordable. Highlighting their importance, local NGOs are now commercially farming the larvae to supply orphanages and meet market demand, promoting a sustainable and culturally significant food source.</p>

          <p>A powerful wave of Gen Z-led protests against systemic government corruption and high unemployment has resulted in the dramatic overthrow of Nepal's government. The turmoil, which involved violent clashes that killed over 70 people, culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli. In a significant political shift, Sushila Karki, the nation's first female chief justice, was appointed interim prime minister, her leadership propelled by a youth movement that effectively used social media to expose the lavish lifestyles of the political elite.</p>

The main warm-up area is situated a 15-minute bus ride from the competition stadium, a situation Hodgkinson described as "draining" and disruptive to pre-race preparations. World Athletics President Lord Coe acknowledged the arrangement is "not perfect," explaining that the track used during the Olympics was unavailable, but assured that organizers were doing everything possible to manage the situation effectively.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Limerence and Overcoming Romantic Obsession</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book explores "limerence," a psychological state of intense romantic infatuation marked by intrusive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows. While this can be a normal phase in early love, it can evolve into a form of "person addiction" if the feelings are unreciprocated or the relationship is unattainable, leading to anxiety and craving. Bellamy outlines several strategies to break this cycle, including limiting contact, consciously reframing positive daydreams into negative ones, and pursuing new personal goals to shift focus.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrats Face Questions on Future Strategy Beyond Leader's Stunts</h2>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrat party convenes for its annual conference, it confronts a key strategic question: how to build upon its recent electoral gains. While leader Sir Ed Davey's playful and unconventional stunts have successfully captured media attention, recent polling indicates that many voters, including the party's own supporters, believe they detract from a serious political image. The party's challenge now is to broaden its policy platform and appeal beyond its southern English strongholds, aiming to capitalize on the internal struggles of both the Conservative and Labour parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in workplaces to help combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks, yet its overall impact is proving to be complex. While AI tools can significantly reduce cognitive load and emotional exhaustion, some research indicates that frequent AI users may actually report higher levels of burnout. This paradox occurs because the efficiency gains from AI can lead to employees taking on more work, and constant engagement with the technology can be mentally taxing, suggesting a need for thoughtful implementation by companies.

          <p>In a deeply emotional evening at Dodger Stadium, pitcher Clayton Kershaw made what was likely his final regular-season home start, just one day after announcing his retirement at the end of the year. The 37-year-old franchise icon was honored with prolonged standing ovations from a sell-out crowd during his 4⅓ innings on the mound. The night concluded in perfect fashion as the Dodgers came back to win 6-3 against the San Francisco Giants, clinching their 13th consecutive postseason berth and providing a celebratory send-off.</p>
