          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government could allow companies listed in Hong Kong to seek secondary share listings in Shenzhen. This change would permit mainland companies with Hong Kong-listed shares (H shares) to issue yuan-denominated shares (A shares) on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, reversing the previous A + H pathway. Analysts suggest this move could diversify fundraising options for businesses in the Greater Bay Area, encouraging more Hong Kong share offerings. Wilson Chan Fung-cheung notes that it would allow businesses to expand operations in mainland China, where their brands are more widely recognized. The potential for dual listings could also attract more businesses to list in Hong Kong, simplifying the share offering process. Optimism score is 70. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump, following a public dispute between the two. Musk's comments came after Trump declared their relationship was over, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill. Musk acknowledged that his posts went "too far" in the exchange. This development suggests a potential attempt to de-escalate tensions between the two high-profile figures, though Trump has indicated no interest in mending ties. The article conveys a sense of reconciliation. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>German Air Force General Ingo Gerhartz has taken command of NATO's Allied Joint Force Command in Brunssum, Netherlands, overseeing the operational protection of NATO's eastern flank. This appointment comes at a time when deterring and defending the eastern part of the alliance area has become a core task for NATO states, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Recent warnings have highlighted the possibility of Russia testing NATO's commitment to mutual defense. Gerhartz's promotion to four-star general underscores the importance of his new role in maintaining security and stability in the region. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Salmonella, a common cause of food poisoning, is responsible for millions of infections in the U.S. each year. Despite its name, it has no connection to the fish salmon; instead, it's named after Daniel E. Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist. Theobald Smith, Salmon's laboratory assistant, is believed by some to have been the one who isolated the microorganism from sick pigs in 1885. One of the earliest and most famous cases of a salmonella outbreak began with Mary Mallon, an asymptomatic carrier of salmonella typhi, who unknowingly infected several families while working as a cook in New York. The article provides a historical overview of the bacteria and its impact. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>A full Strawberry Moon will be visible in UK skies, accompanied by a rare phenomenon not seen in almost 20 years. The almost full Moon appeared very low in the southern sky, making it appear larger than usual.

The opportunity to see the Moon this low in the sky will not arise again until 2043, making it a unique event for stargazers. Optimism score is 90.</p>

          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has announced it raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a Series A funding round, the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. Investors are hopeful the company can develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, is viewed as a pivotal technology in the energy transition. If replicated at an industrial scale, it could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy, though some researchers believe it is still a long way off from commercial use.
