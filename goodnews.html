          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Accepting Luxury Jet Gift from Qatar</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, valued at approximately $400 million, as a gift from the royal family of Qatar. The jet would serve as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, at which point ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal experts within the White House and DOJ have determined the arrangement to be legally permissible, as the gift is not conditioned on any official act and is being given to the Air Force and then the library foundation, not to Trump directly. This unprecedented arrangement has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and constitutional violations.</p>

          <p>Washington officials have expressed optimism following trade negotiations with China in Geneva, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing "substantial progress." The talks aim to de-escalate tensions between the two largest economies after Trump imposed tariffs on China, leading to retaliatory measures. The negotiations occur amidst complaints filed with the World Trade Organization against Trump's tariff approach. Earlier in the week, the US and UK announced a trade deal, though a final agreement is yet to be signed.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating their trade war following high-level talks in Geneva.

          <p>Prince Harry‚Äôs plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has highlighted a rupture that could undermine the monarchy‚Äôs attempts to model unity. Harry‚Äôs emotional appeal, made in a recent interview, resurfaced bitter divisions within the royal family. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed.

          <p>This article critiques a recent Saturday Night Live sketch about a server intensely flirting with middle-aged mothers, arguing that it reinforces negative stereotypes about women and motherhood. While the sketch seemed to aim at subverting the idea that middle-aged women, and mothers in particular, are both undesirable and empty of desire themselves, the sketch implied how ridiculous it was that a guy like him could truly be hot for these silly, frumpy old moms. The show had an opportunity to push back against the stereotype that middle-aged women, and mothers in particular, are both undesirable and empty of desire themselves.</p>
