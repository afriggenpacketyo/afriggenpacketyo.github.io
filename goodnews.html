          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that a lasting peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Moscow and Kyiv. Speaking after President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, Rubio stated that if one side gets everything it wants, it's surrender, which neither side is close to. He outlined that key areas for negotiation include security guarantees for Ukraine, the demarcation of territories, and plans for rebuilding the country. The administration's goal is to make enough progress to facilitate a direct meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin to finalize a deal and end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes summit in Alaska, a special U.S. envoy announced a potential Russian concession regarding the war in Ukraine. According to envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. Witkoff described this development as "game-changing," suggesting it could be a crucial workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. European leaders cautiously welcomed the news, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy noted that specific details on how such a guarantee would function remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Recent filings reveal that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has continued to reduce its positions in two of its largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. In the second quarter, the conglomerate sold 7% of its Apple stake and 4% of its Bank of America shares, continuing a year-long trend. Concurrently, Berkshire initiated a new $1.57 billion position in UnitedHealth Group, a major healthcare insurer whose stock has fallen significantly this year amid rising medical costs and a Department of Justice investigation. This move reflects a classic value investing strategy, buying into a market leader during a period of struggle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara has become the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, a country of eight million people, offering hope to patients who previously had none. Before his practice began in January 2025, individuals with severe head trauma, spinal injuries, or brain tumors had to seek costly treatment abroad or face disability and death. Supported by an international network of nonprofits like Mission Brain and dedicated surgeons, Dr. Kamara received training and essential equipment. He recently performed the country's first-ever spine surgery, successfully restoring movement to a paralyzed patient in a hospital where power outages are a constant challenge.</p>

          <p>Amid improving investor sentiment following a softer inflation report, top Wall Street analysts have identified three stocks with strong long-term growth prospects. Social media platform Pinterest is favored for its solid execution and potential as a "Clear AI Winner," despite mixed recent earnings. AI cloud computing company CoreWeave is recommended due to unrelenting demand for high-performance computing, even with a larger-than-expected quarterly loss. Finally, coffee giant Starbucks received an upgrade, with analysts expressing confidence that turnaround strategies under new leadership will be effective, making its recently underperforming stock an attractive investment with an improved risk-reward profile.

          <p>Actor Adam Scott discusses his career trajectory leading to his Emmy-nominated role in the hit Apple TV+ series "Severance." Previously known for comedic roles in shows like "Parks and Recreation," Scott admits he was initially terrified to be the face of a major drama. The series, directed by Ben Stiller, features Scott as a man whose work and personal memories are surgically divided, a complex dual role that required him to draw on his 30 years of acting experience. The show's critical acclaim and massive popularity have vindicated the long path Scott has taken to becoming a recognized dramatic lead.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of unity, several European leaders and the NATO Secretary-General will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his meeting with President Trump in Washington. This move is seen as an effort to bolster Zelenskyy's position and ensure European interests are represented following Trump's direct summit with Vladimir Putin, from which Ukraine was excluded. The gathering underscores European concerns that Ukraine could be pressured into an unfavorable peace deal. U.S. officials maintain the meeting is a planned next step, intended to build on what they describe as progress made during the talks with the Russian leader.</p>

          <h2>Crystal Palace Goal Disallowed Due to Attacking Player's Proximity to Defensive Wall</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stunning free-kick by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a little-known rule regarding player positioning. The goal was nullified because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to IFAB Law 13, when three or more defenders form a wall, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance until the ball is in play. This rule was introduced in the 2019-20 season to prevent attackers from interfering with the wall, which often caused delays and management issues for referees.</p>

          <h2>CEO Who Replaced 80% of Staff Over AI Adoption Hesitancy Stands By Decision</h2>

          <p>Two years ago, Eric Vaughan, CEO of software company IgniteTech, laid off nearly 80% of his workforce due to their resistance to rapidly adopting artificial intelligence. He says he would do it again, citing the company's subsequent success, including launching new AI products and achieving a 75% EBITDA margin. Vaughan found that technical staff were often the most resistant, focusing on AI's limitations rather than its potential. The company underwent a massive cultural and structural reorganization, centralizing all divisions under a new AI organization to foster belief and accelerate innovation, a move he describes as a painful but necessary business transformation.</p>
