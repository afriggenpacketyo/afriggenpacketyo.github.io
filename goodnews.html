A memorial service was held at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki. The battle resulted in over 200,000 casualties, including military personnel and residents.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces a potential shortage of giant pandas, with all pandas currently in the country scheduled to return to China. Foreign affairs experts suggest that China may loan new pandas to Japan as a gesture to stabilize relations amid increasing tensions with the United States. The panda is seen as a symbol of friendship, and a new loan could coincide with a potential visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. However, some analysts doubt the gesture will have the same diplomatic weight as it once did. </p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence increases, researchers are uncovering more instances of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The emergence of these issues is compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Experts advocate for practices like red teaming, where individuals test AI systems to identify potential harm. Standardized "AI flaw" reports, incentives, and better dissemination of information are recommended to improve the understanding and management of risks posed by AI tools. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships has identified five "toxic" phrases that can hinder children's cooperation. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the study suggests using language that respects a child's autonomy and fosters a sense of emotional safety. Alternative phrases include explaining the reasoning behind decisions, giving children agency over their actions, and validating their emotions. The real secret to getting kids to listen is creating conditions where cooperation feels natural. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported to police for suspected cyberstalking offences, raising concerns about the normalization of digital surveillance. Experts argue that constant online monitoring, often seen as a sign of love and care, can fuel concerning behaviors. The Crime Survey for England and Wales found that people aged 16 to 19 were most likely to be victims of stalking. The government is introducing measures to allow victims to learn their stalker's identity quickly and expand the use of Stalking Protection Orders. </p>
