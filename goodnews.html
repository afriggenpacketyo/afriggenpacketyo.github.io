          <p>Portugal's right-of-center Democratic Alliance secured victory in the recent snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years. However, the party once again failed to achieve a majority, prompting its leader, Lu√≠s Montenegro, to pledge efforts toward stimulating investment and ensuring prosperity and social justice. The Socialist leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, resigned following his party's second-place finish, with the far-right Chega party closely trailing behind. The final seat distribution may shift pending the counting of votes from abroad.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidential election after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion initially gained momentum, but Dan secured victory with 55% of the vote, appealing to Romanians seeking change and European integration. The election occurred amidst political turbulence, including the collapse of the government and allegations of Russian interference in previous elections. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, contrasting with Simion's anti-EU stance.</p>

          <p>A three-day strike by NJ Transit engineers has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal, but full train service will not resume until Tuesday due to safety inspections. The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey, impacted hundreds of thousands of commuters. Governor Phil Murphy announced the agreement, emphasizing that it is fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting a series of concessions that will eventually pay for the wage increases the union sought. The last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in talks to redefine their relationship, driven by the changing global landscape and shared security concerns. Both sides recognize the logic of closer defense and security ties in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and concerns about European security. The negotiations focus on removing trade barriers, improving the movement of food and touring artists, and establishing a security pact. The EU is keen on a youth mobility scheme to facilitate travel for young people, while the UK seeks to ensure it maintains political space and avoids rejoining key EU pillars.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China‚Äôs yuan has the potential to rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, argues that the US dollar is no longer the safe currency it used to be, and the yuan is growing as a possible alternative. To compete effectively, China must deepen its financial markets to allow foreign investors better access to yuan-denominated assets and address concerns about convertibility.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his third major title by winning the US PGA Championship, overcoming a brief challenge from Jon Rahm. Scheffler's consistent performance and ability to maintain composure allowed him to cruise to victory, finishing five strokes ahead of the competition. Rahm's bid to win a first US PGA for Spain was derailed by errors on the back nine, while other contenders struggled to sustain momentum. Scheffler's win further solidifies his position at the top of the world rankings and marks his 15th victory since early 2022.</p>

Nawrocki came second with 29.1% of the vote. If the poll is confirmed by the final official result ‚Äì not expected until late Monday ‚Äì Trzaskowski and Nawrocki will compete in a second-round on 1 June as none of the 13 candidates won more than 50% of the vote.</p>

          <p>Pro-European Union candidate Nicusor Dan has won Romania's closely watched presidential runoff against a hard-right nationalist, nearly complete electoral data shows. A huge turnout Sunday played a key role in the tense election that many viewed as a geopolitical choice between East or West. After 10.7 million of 11.6 million votes were counted, Dan was ahead with 54.19%, while Simion trailed at 45.81%, according to official data. In the first-round vote on May 4, Simion won almost double the votes as Dan, and many local surveys had predicted he would secure the presidency.</p>

Anduril operates as a defense products company, investing its own resources to create working products rather than relying on government funding for development. Luckey believes autonomous weapons promote peace by deterring adversaries and reducing the need for American military deployment. The company is developing systems like the Roadrunner drone interceptor, advanced headsets, and the Fury unmanned fighter jet.</p>
