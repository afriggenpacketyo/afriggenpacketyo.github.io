          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 13:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An explosion, believed to have originated in the boiler room, caused a corner of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx to collapse on Wednesday morning. The blast sent debris raining down onto the street, but remarkably, officials have reported no injuries or fatalities. Mayor Eric Adams and other city officials were on the scene, coordinating evacuations and inspections to ensure the building's structural integrity. The incident draws comparisons to a similar building collapse in the Bronx in late 2023, which also resulted in no serious injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction significantly alters the cost of homeownership, with the monthly principal and interest payment on a $450,000 mortgage now calculated at approximately $2,736. This represents a monthly saving of about $270 compared to rates in January 2025 and nearly $500 compared to October 2024. The lower rates are narrowing the gap between renting and buying for many potential homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand aimed at price-sensitive consumers, featuring over 1,000 items with most priced under five dollars. The brand, called Amazon Grocery, consolidates the company's existing Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh labels into a single offering. This move comes as consumers remain conscious of their spending and Amazon continues to adjust its grocery business strategy, which has included closing its U.K. Go and Fresh stores. The announcement caused a slight dip in the stock prices of competing grocery retailers like Walmart and Kroger.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred President Trump's request to immediately fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position until oral arguments are heard in January. Trump has sought to remove Cook, citing unproven claims of mortgage fraud, in a move widely viewed as an attempt to exert political influence over the historically independent central bank. The case is considered a significant test of presidential authority over the Federal Reserve. Cook denies any wrongdoing and will continue to participate in the Fed's upcoming interest rate decisions while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Australia successfully started its ICC Women's Cricket World Cup title defense with an 89-run win against New Zealand in Indore. All-rounder Ash Gardner was instrumental, scoring a powerful 115 runs to help Australia recover from a precarious position and post a total of 326. In response, New Zealand captain Sophie Devine mounted a strong challenge with a century of her own, scoring 112 runs. However, her dismissal triggered a late collapse, with New Zealand losing their last four wickets for just two runs, securing the victory for the defending champions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an infrastructure fund manager owned by BlackRock, is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire renewable power company AES for approximately $38 billion. The potential deal, one of the largest infrastructure takeovers in history, would position BlackRock to capitalize on the surging global demand for power driven by the artificial intelligence boom. AES operates power plants worldwide and has supplied energy to major tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft for their power-intensive data centers. The acquisition would significantly expand BlackRock's infrastructure portfolio and diversify its revenue streams. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in overall U.S. auto sales for the third quarter, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush to purchase EVs before a $7,500 federal tax incentive expired at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's saw a 30% increase. The strong performance helped GM maintain its position as the top automaker in U.S. sales, with the company estimating its highest market share since 2015.</p>

          <p>Internet and communication services have been restored across Afghanistan following a 48-hour nationwide blackout ordered by the Taliban government. The shutdown had provoked widespread condemnation, disrupting businesses, grounding flights, and cutting off Afghans from emergency services and vital contact with the outside world. The Taliban has not provided an official reason for the blackout, though a provincial official previously suggested it was to prevent 'vices.' The restoration brought relief and celebration, as the internet has been a crucial lifeline, particularly for women and girls whose rights and access to education have been severely restricted.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fears within the pharmaceutical industry over potential tariffs have subsided following a deal between the Trump administration and Pfizer to voluntarily lower U.S. drug prices. In exchange, Pfizer received a three-year exemption from any future pharma-specific tariffs and pledged a $70 billion investment in domestic manufacturing. The agreement signals a path for other major drugmakers to avoid punitive levies by negotiating similar pricing and investment pacts with the administration. This development provides more certainty for the industry, shifting the focus from widespread tariffs to individual company negotiations with the White House.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients, including some artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. The change will impact around 1,000 items across brands like Great Value and Marketside, responding to consumer demand for simpler and more familiar ingredients. This move by the nation's largest grocer follows similar initiatives by other major food manufacturers and comes amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial food dyes. The company stated that 90% of its private brand products are already free from these synthetic colorings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing against home equity has become more affordable for homeowners. Current rates for a 15-year, $30,000 home equity loan are around 8.21%, resulting in a monthly payment of approximately $290. This is a modest decrease compared to rates seen earlier in the year and in late 2024. Home equity loans provide homeowners with a fixed-rate borrowing option for a variety of expenses. However, the article notes that homeowners should also compare these rates with those of a home equity line of credit (HELOC). (not investment advice)</p>
