          <p>Shares of Coinbase and Circle experienced significant gains after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. The GENIUS Act allows private companies to issue stablecoins under strict regulations, including full reserve backing and monthly audits. Coinbase, which co-founded USDC and shares revenue with Circle, saw its shares increase by over 16%, while Circle's stock rose by 33% since its recent IPO. The bill now proceeds to the House for further consideration, where reconciliation with the House's version, STABLE, will be necessary to finalize the legislation, potentially paving the way for significant growth in the stablecoin market.

While the central bank expects inflation to increase in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the solid labor market and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed anticipates inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With high credit card interest rates, it could take years or decades to pay off even modest amounts of card debt by only making the minimum payments. Expediting the process requires a reliable strategy, whether tackled alone or with help. Paying off $8,000 in debt with minimum payments could take over 30 years and cost nearly $40,000 in interest, whereas a flat $250 monthly payment could reduce this to just over four years. Debt relief options such as debt consolidation, balance transfers, debt management plans, and debt settlement can significantly reduce the payoff timeline and total interest paid.
