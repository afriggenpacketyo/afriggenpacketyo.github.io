          <p>Pentagon officials, including General Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, defended the success of recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during a press conference. They presented video evidence of bunker-buster bombs being tested, emphasizing the severity of the strikes despite a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting the strikes only delayed Iran's nuclear program by months. Hegseth criticized media coverage of the leaked report, calling it an attempt to undermine the mission's success. The officials stated that final assessments would take time, but initial battle damage assessments indicated severe damage and destruction across all three sites.</p>

          <p>The British pound briefly reached its highest level against the U.S. dollar in almost four years after markets reacted to reports that President Donald Trump might accelerate the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve. The dollar weakened following the Wall Street Journal's report that Trump considered naming Jerome Powell's replacement by September or October. Concerns exist that the president may appoint someone sympathetic to his demands for lower interest rates. The uncertainty surrounding the Fed's independence has contributed to the pound's strength against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the monthly payments one might expect from a $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65. It notes that such an annuity can significantly boost retirement income, acting like a personal pension by providing guaranteed monthly income. However, payouts vary based on gender, annuity type, and the interest rate environment. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old man could receive about $1,294 per month, while a woman of the same age might receive around $1,240. (not investment advice)</p>
