          <p>Emerging market stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, particularly after Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America suggests that emerging markets are poised for a bull market, citing a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan also upgraded emerging market equities due to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen significantly this year, contrasting with the more modest gains of the S&P 500, indicating a shift in investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are urging the European Union to address the baggage fee policies of several low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses these airlines of misleading passengers with unclear baggage rules, causing confusion and distress during check-in. Passengers can incur extra charges of up to ‚Ç¨280 for baggage, leading the consumer groups to call for a standard luggage allowance to be included in ticket prices. While Ryanair asserts compliance with EU law, other airlines argue that the fees are essential for managing weight and space, ensuring safety and punctuality.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues amid ongoing tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar is not a point of contention in the trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets. Japan is considering backing off from seeking a full removal of U.S. tariffs in order to reach a mutually beneficial deal.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing a break from a recent heat wave, with temperatures expected to decrease slightly. Inland areas experienced the most extreme heat, with Palm Springs hitting 104 degrees. The National Weather Service heat advisory has expired, and a low-pressure system is expected to bring cooler temperatures and the return of "May gray," characterized by overcast conditions. Another round of heat may be on the horizon next week, but the extent of the warming is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has returned the majority of books removed from its library due to their focus on anti-racism and gender issues, following a recent Pentagon review. Initially, 381 books were purged, but all but about 20 have been returned to the shelves. The removals were part of a broader effort to eliminate DEI content from federal agencies. The Defense Department has provided more specific guidelines for the reviews, leading to fewer books being banned than initially anticipated.</p>
