          <p>At its recent party conference, the Reform UK party made a concerted effort to showcase a wider range of political figures, aiming to counter the perception that it is solely dependent on its leader, Nigel Farage. The event highlighted new Members of Parliament and prospective candidates, such as former Conservative defectors Laila Cunningham and Stephen Atkinson. This strategy is part of a broader push to build a larger, more resilient political organization with thousands of vetted candidates for upcoming local and national elections. The party is focused on rigorous candidate selection to avoid past scandals and establish a credible nationwide presence.</p>

          <p>A UK-based organization named Sisters in Service is providing a vital support network for female military veterans who have transitioned into healthcare careers. Co-founded by Dr. Bex Bennett, a former Army officer who served in Iraq, the group addresses the unique challenges women veterans face, including feelings of isolation and misconceptions about their military roles. The community offers a space for shared experiences, helping members navigate the difficulties of both their past service and their demanding new professions. Members emphasize the importance of connecting with others who understand their journey from the front lines to healthcare.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ukrainian military is extensively using a wide array of decoy weapons, from inflatable tanks to plywood artillery, to mislead Russian forces and deplete their ammunition. These tactics are designed to trick the enemy into targeting fake equipment, thereby wasting valuable resources like expensive kamikaze drones on low-cost imitations. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in producing these decoys, such as flat-pack models of the M777 howitzer. This strategy of deception has become a significant element of the conflict, with both sides utilizing fake targets to overload enemy surveillance and defense systems.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document religious miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His path to sainthood was fast-tracked after the Vatican attributed two miracles to his intercession. The canonization is seen as an effort by the Church to connect with and inspire younger generations by elevating a modern figure who enjoyed contemporary activities like playing video games.</p>

          <p>As Anna Wintour steps down from her role as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly four decades, the fashion world is contemplating the magazine's future relevance under her successor, Chloe Malle. Wintour is credited with transforming Vogue by merging high fashion with popular culture, famously putting celebrities like Madonna on the cover. However, in today's fast-paced digital landscape dominated by social media, print magazines face immense pressure to maintain their influence. Malle's challenge will be to navigate this new era and determine if Vogue can continue to be a cultural arbiter without Wintour's iconic leadership at the helm.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), beginning October 12. The system will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area, instead recording entries and exits electronically. First-time travelers under the new system will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, at automated kiosks or with border officers. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns remain about potential long queues and delays during the initial registration and transition period.</p>

          <p>American independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch has won the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, for his film "Father Mother Sister Brother." The movie, a comedy-drama starring Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver, explores the relationships between adult children and their parents.

Dickson finished with an unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls, single-handedly turning the game after Somerset's chase of 191 seemed unlikely.

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 matches. Despite the dominant final score, England's performance was initially unsettled by Australia's intensity, leading to uncharacteristic errors in their usually reliable set-piece and maul. The team eventually found their rhythm, particularly in the second half where they kept the Wallaroos scoreless. While the win confirms their status as tournament favorites, the early struggles have provided potential rivals with insights into possible weaknesses ahead of the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position for the Italian Grand Prix by setting a new all-time Formula 1 record for the fastest lap in the sport's history. His lap at Monza averaged 164.466 mph, surpassing the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars having lower drag, a recently resurfaced track with higher grip, and Monza's long straights. Verstappen expressed optimism about his chances in the race, despite McLaren's typical strong race pace this season.</p>
