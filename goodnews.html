          <p>A 21-year-old Ukrainian national, Roman Lavrynovch, has been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life after fires at two properties and a car linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Lavrynovch is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court, and the charges highlight the potential dangers faced by public figures and their families.

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been resorting to buying replacement parts on eBay and using 3D printers to create new parts for its aging systems. Duffy explained that the FAA's equipment is decades old, necessitating these unconventional measures to maintain operations. The Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of the air traffic control system, including replacing radars, control towers, and telecommunications systems, at a potentially high cost.

          <p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill prohibiting local governments from adding fluoride to their water systems, making Florida the second state after Utah to implement such a ban. DeSantis argued that individuals should have the choice to avoid overexposure to fluoride, despite concerns from dentists and public health advocates about potential negative impacts on dental health. Some local governments in Florida, like Miami-Dade County, had already moved to remove fluoride from their water ahead of the statewide ban. The move follows a push by figures like Robert F.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, including a period of surging inflation. He suggested that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, and that more frequent supply shocks could pose a difficult challenge for the economy and central banks. Powell's remarks highlight the balancing act the Fed faces in supporting employment while controlling inflation, especially amidst potential impacts from tariffs and other policy changes.</p>

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief, but it complicates future credit access, as lenders view it as a sign of repayment inability. Cards included in settlement agreements are usually closed, and other accounts may face reduced limits or denial of transactions. Debt settlement remains on credit reports for seven years, impacting credit scores. Rebuilding credit involves monitoring reports, starting with secured credit cards, and responsible use, like timely payments and low balances. Waiting six months after settlement before applying for new cards can help stabilize credit profiles, showcasing patience and responsible financial behavior.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to revisit its approval of azodicarbonamide (ADA), a food additive used to whiten cereal flour and improve bread dough, after safety concerns have been raised. Also called the 'yoga mat' chemical, ADA is banned in Europe due to potential health risks, including the possibility of forming a carcinogen called semicarbazide during bread making. The FDA will conduct a renewed safety review of ADA and other preservatives, such as BHT and BHA, as part of a broader effort to increase scrutiny of previously approved food chemicals.</p>

          <p>Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, accused federal prosecutors of attempting to ‚Äúhumiliate and degrade‚Äù him by requiring him to provide fingerprints and have a mugshot taken a second time after a court appearance. The trespassing charge stemmed from his arrest at an immigration detention center protest, raising concerns that the Trump administration is targeting Democratic politicians. Baraka, a vocal opponent of Trump's immigration policies, maintained that he did not violate any laws and was standing up for constitutional rights, while his attorney suggested the charges were selectively prosecuted.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that rice sold in stores across the U.S. contains high levels of arsenic and cadmium, with arsenic found in 100% of samples tested. One in four rice samples exceeded the federal limit for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal, raising concerns about potential health risks, especially for infants and toddlers. The report tested various brands and suggested methods to reduce exposure, such as cooking rice like pasta and using rice alternatives. The USA Rice Federation stated that while they don't believe there is a public health safety issue, they will continue to work with the FDA to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets any established threshold.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investing in gold should not be based on a set schedule but rather viewed as a critical component of a diversified portfolio, typically constituting no more than 10% of overall holdings. The decision to invest in gold should be driven by individual investor profiles and financial goals, rather than a specific timeline. Waiting for a perceived 'cheap' time to invest may result in missed opportunities, as gold prices generally increase over time. Existing investors should consider a timeline for rebuilding gold investments if they choose to sell portions of their holdings, ensuring continued portfolio protection and stability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a legal theory that tightly restricted lawsuits seeking to hold police officers accountable for using deadly force. The case, arising from a police shooting during a traffic stop, centered on whether courts should limit their consideration to the seconds preceding the shooting or consider the larger context of the encounter. Justice Elena Kagan wrote that courts must consider all relevant circumstances, including events leading up to the climactic moment, to assess whether an officer acted reasonably. The decision provides a broader scope for evaluating police conduct in such cases.</p>

The Magna Carta, a foundational document in legal history, aimed to limit the king's power and guarantee certain rights. Originals of the document are rare, with only about two dozen known to exist. The discovery highlights the value of preserving and digitizing historical archives, revealing hidden treasures and enriching scholarly understanding.</p>
