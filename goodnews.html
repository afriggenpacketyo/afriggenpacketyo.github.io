          <p>South Korea's military has ceased broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border as a goodwill gesture. The decision, initiated by President Lee Jae-myung, aims to foster trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which included K-pop songs and messages critical of the North Korean regime, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign involving trash-laden balloons sent into South Korean territory. While North Korea has not yet responded, this move signals a shift towards reconciliation after heightened tensions fueled by military exercises and nuclear ambitions. </p>

          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, a patchwork creation of 42 quilts and 23 textile panels, is being displayed at the Tate Modern to honor nearly 400 individuals who died from HIV/Aids. The quilt, created by loved ones, serves as a reminder of the bravery and beauty of those lost during the epidemic. The exhibition aims to provide an opportunity for collective grief and remembrance, addressing the stigma and lack of proper mourning during the 1980s and 1990s. Author Charlie Porter initiated the exhibition to allow more people to see the quilt and honor the lives lost to HIV/Aids. </p>
