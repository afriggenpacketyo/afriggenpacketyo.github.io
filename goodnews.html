          <p>Uber is launching a new program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow women passengers to request female drivers. The feature, called "women drivers," also gives women the option to share rides exclusively with other women. The company acknowledges that this preference may lead to longer wait times, given that only about one in five of its drivers are women. This initiative, which also allows female drivers to prioritize female riders, expands on similar successful programs Uber has operated in 40 other countries.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing market estimates. The company's success is largely driven by sustained, high demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is essential for generative AI chipsets used by clients like Nvidia. Revenue and operating profit saw significant year-over-year growth of 35% and 68%, respectively. SK Hynix stated that it anticipates stable demand for the remainder of the year due to healthy customer inventory levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler stated his decision was based on the importance of his competitive district in maintaining the narrow Republican House majority. The announcement drew a sharp response from incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who suggested Lawler lacked the courage to challenge her. The decision also impacts the potential field of Republican gubernatorial candidates, which may include Rep. Elise Stefanik.</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its search, advertising, and cloud divisions. The company's revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with Google Cloud revenue increasing by 32%. However, Alphabet also announced it is raising its projected capital expenditures for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion. This increased spending is intended to support the growing demand for its cloud services and expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, beating expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The expansion was primarily fueled by a strong 4.2% quarterly increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. This positive economic data comes as the country faces a critical deadline in trade negotiations with the United States. Failure to secure a deal could result in significant U.S. tariffs on South Korean goods, impacting its export-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison has announced a plan to directly compensate victims of the deadly Eaton fire, a move aimed at avoiding protracted and expensive litigation. The program will be open to those who lost property, were injured, or had family members die in the blaze that killed 19 people. While the official cause is still under investigation, Edison's move comes as it faces dozens of lawsuits. An attorney for fire victims expressed skepticism, suggesting the program could be a way for the utility to underpay victims compared to what they might receive through legal action.</p>

          <p>A new large-scale analysis published in The Lancet Public Health journal suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is linked to significant health benefits. Compared to taking only 2,000 steps, the 7,000-step count was associated with a 47% lower risk of death, a 38% lower risk of dementia, and a 25% lower risk of heart disease. The research reviewed dozens of past studies and concluded that while 10,000 steps is a good target for active individuals, 7,000 steps may be a more realistic and achievable goal for many people to see meaningful health improvements.</p>

          <p>IBM's stock fell in extended trading even after the company reported second-quarter results that surpassed overall Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings. The decline was attributed to the company's software revenue, which, despite growing 10%, fell slightly short of analyst consensus. IBM's infrastructure and consulting divisions both performed strongly, and the company maintained its full-year guidance. CEO Arvind Krishna also noted that IBM's generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion since its inception. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the most universally understood words, "OK," has its roots in a 19th-century American joke. Scholars have traced its first appearance to an 1839 Boston newspaper, where it was used as a playful abbreviation for a deliberate misspelling of "all correct" as "oll korrect." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign. His supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," a nod to his nickname "Old Kinderhook," cementing the term in the American lexicon before it spread globally.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on profits from the sale of primary residences. Currently, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to the tax. The idea, recently introduced in a House bill, is intended to boost the housing market and provide financial relief to long-term homeowners, particularly seniors. Experts note that while the proposal may gain some interest, a more likely outcome could be raising the existing exemption thresholds rather than eliminating the tax entirely.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, one of the most important things people can do to help prevent blood clots is to avoid long periods of inactivity. Regular movement and exercise are crucial because they improve blood circulation and prevent blood from pooling, a condition known as stasis, which is a primary cause of clots. Experts recommend incorporating feasible activities into daily routines, such as taking walks or using stairs. They also stress the importance of staying hydrated and understanding personal risk factors for clotting, such as obesity and smoking.</p>
