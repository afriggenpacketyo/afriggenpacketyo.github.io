          <p>The latest episode of "South Park" tackles the current political climate by using Donald Trump not as its primary target, but as a vehicle to critique its parent company, Paramount. The episode, titled “Sermon on the ’Mount,” satirizes Paramount's recent business decisions, including a lawsuit settlement with Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." By weaving real-world corporate drama into its narrative, the show's creators deliver a pointed commentary on corporate allegiances and the chilling effect of political pressure on media companies.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Potatoes Evolved From an Ancient Hybrid of Tomato and Another Plant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 11:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study proposes a surprising origin for the potato, suggesting its lineage began 8-9 million years ago from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and a different flowering plant. This improbable union resulted in a new species that could form tubers, a trait neither parent possessed, allowing it to thrive in new environments. This discovery challenges the traditional view of hybridization as an evolutionary dead end, showcasing it as a powerful force capable of creating novel and successful species, fundamentally changing our understanding of this staple crop's history.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has opened its 1,000th new bank branch in the last seven years, a milestone in its nationwide expansion that contrasts with the industry's trend of branch closures. The new location in Charlotte, North Carolina, underscores the bank's strategy to increase its physical footprint and capture more deposits in growing markets. With approximately 5,000 locations, JPMorgan now has the largest branch network in the U.S., a move that comes as competitors like Bank of America also announce plans to expand their own physical presence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is partnering with over 60 technology companies, including Oracle and Microsoft, to improve access to health care data for older and disabled Americans on Medicare. The initiative aims to create digital tools that allow patients to easily share their health records between different doctors and systems. While the administration touts this as a step toward patient empowerment, critics raise significant privacy concerns, noting that patient data shared with less-regulated third-party apps could be sold or shared with other federal agencies.</p>

          <p>CVS Health's stock saw a significant jump after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst estimates and raised its full-year profit forecast. The positive results were driven by strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and signs of recovery in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been managing higher medical costs. This performance marks a potential turnaround for the company under its new CEO, who highlighted investments in technology and a new drug pricing model as key factors in its success.

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four charges of spot-fixing by an independent regulatory commission after a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting yellow cards to influence betting markets and faced a potential lifetime ban. While the commission found the spot-fixing charges "not proven," it did find him guilty on two lesser charges of failing to cooperate with the investigation, for which a sanction will be decided later.</p>
