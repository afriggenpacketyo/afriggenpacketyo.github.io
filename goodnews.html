        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke has indicated that Malaysian airlines, including AirAsia and the nascent Air Borneo, are expressing interest in China's C919 passenger jet. This growing regional interest is driven by a surge in air travel demand across Southeast Asia and the considerable delivery backlogs currently experienced with Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Loke noted that airlines are actively seeking to diversify their procurement options, prioritizing faster delivery times and more cost-effective solutions. China is actively promoting its Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) models, including the C919, as viable and cheaper alternatives to the established Western manufacturers, potentially reshaping regional aviation supply chains.</p>

          <p>Oil giant Shell reported better-than-expected second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a downturn in global oil and gas prices. The company maintained its robust shareholder returns, announcing another $3.5 billion in share buybacks for the upcoming three months, marking its fifteenth consecutive quarter of significant buybacks. These strong results follow Shell's strategic shift earlier in the year to prioritize shareholder value and cost reductions, a plan that has seen its share price outperform many European and U.S. competitors. Shell achieved $800 million in structural cost reductions in the first half of the year, moving closer to its ambitious $5-7 billion target by 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New World Development (NWD) is intensifying its luxury home sales efforts across Hong Kong and mainland China, with plans to deliver three high-end residential projects this quarter. This strategic acceleration aims to boost capital recycling, leveraging the robust primary property market in Hong Kong. The company has already achieved significant success, including the sale of over 600 flats at The Pavilia Forest, a joint venture, which generated more than HK$4.2 billion. Additionally, 500 units have been sold across Deep Water Pavilia and Deep Water Pavilia II, bringing in nearly HK$8.8 billion.

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced their decision to formally recognize the state of Palestine in September, joining France and the United Kingdom in a growing international push. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated this recognition is contingent on the Palestinian Authority committing to reforms, including holding general elections in 2026 without Hamas participation and the demilitarization of the Palestinian state. Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela emphasized that their decision contributes to efforts for "lasting peace" in the Middle East. This collective move by several Western nations, despite strong opposition from Israel and the U.S., signifies a concerted effort to advance the two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has returned the sacred Piprahwa Gems, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India following intense pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders. These jewels, discovered in 1898 alongside bone fragments identified as Buddha's, were scheduled for auction in Hong Kong, but the sale was canceled after diplomatic intervention and legal threats. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, a move hailed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a "proud and joyous moment" for the nation's cultural heritage. The jewels will now be placed on permanent public display in India, resolving a significant ethical debate surrounding the commercialization of sacred artifacts.</p>

          <p>China's Shenzhou-19 astronauts have disclosed that their recent record-breaking spacewalk included an unforeseen and critical repair operation. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe reported that a payload adaptor, essential for installing cargo and conducting various extravehicular experiments, unexpectedly jammed. This technical malfunction occurred during a cargo installation outside the spacecraft, presenting a significant challenge. Given the limited time and the unplanned nature of the task, the astronauts did not have specialized equipment readily available. Consequently, they collaborated closely with the ground team to devise and execute an unrehearsed solution, successfully resolving the issue and showcasing their ingenuity and teamwork in space.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in California's Fresno County, with the pilot successfully ejecting to safety before the impact. The incident, which occurred around 6:30 p.m., also ignited a small grass fire that consumed nearly a dozen acres. Authorities confirmed that no other personnel were affected by the crash. The F-35 belonged to the VFA-125 squadron, known as the "Rough Raiders," which is responsible for training pilots on these advanced aircraft. While the cause of the crash is still under investigation, the safe ejection of the pilot is a crucial positive aspect of this serious military aviation event.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two strategic changes to his team for the third and final Test against the Wallabies in Sydney, even though the series has already been won. Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing in place of James Lowe, and James Ryan will step in for Ollie Chessum at lock, making him the third different second-row partner for Maro Itoje. Farrell's selections emphasize team cohesion, with 11 players chosen to start all three Tests, and a pragmatic approach, as he showed "zero sentiment" by not including some players who had yet to feature. The bench composition reflects a six-two split favoring forwards.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers commenced their MLB trade deadline activity with a minor three-team transaction, acquiring pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski, reliever Paul Gervase, and catcher Ben Rortvedt. In return, they sent minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. Serwinowski, a 21-year-old left-hander, is considered the most intriguing acquisition, bolstering a farm system in need of pitching depth. Despite this initial modest move, the Dodgers are still anticipated to be highly active on deadline day, actively pursuing more impactful upgrades. Their primary targets remain strengthening the bullpen and enhancing defensive capabilities in the outfield, navigating what has proven to be a challenging seller's market.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced Canada's intention to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with a United Nations meeting. This decision is contingent on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to governance reforms and holding general elections in 2026 that exclude Hamas. This move follows similar pledges from France and Britain, reflecting increasing international pressure and outrage regarding the humanitarian situation in Gaza. However, Israel strongly condemned Canada's stance, labeling it a "reward for Hamas" that undermines ceasefire and hostage release efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump also voiced opposition, suggesting it would "reward Hamas" and negatively impact potential trade deals with Canada.</p>
