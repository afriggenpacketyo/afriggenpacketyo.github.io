          <h2>NBA Sponsorship Revenue Surges Due to Jersey Patches and New Stadium</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 09:48:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA teams have experienced an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue this season, reaching $1.62 billion, a significant rise from $850 million five years ago, driven by the prevalence of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The rise in jersey patch deals has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing significantly to the league's incremental revenue. The increase in revenue can be compared to adding three new teams to the league. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are identified as the top-spending brands in the league, reflecting the growing investment in NBA partnerships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, lowering the deposit facility rate to 2%, after euro zone inflation fell below the 2% target in May. The ECB has also revised its economic projections, anticipating inflation to average 2% in 2025, reflecting lower energy prices and a stronger euro. Despite the rate cut, the ECB acknowledges that the outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual, with economic growth remaining lackluster, as businesses and policymakers face increasing uncertainty due to rising geopolitical tensions and U.S. tariff policies. While the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%, they noted that rising government investment in defense and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to mitigate a potential labor shortage in the long term, but its near-term impact on deflationary pressures is debated. Some analysts believe that AI adoption could exacerbate deflationary pressures by disrupting the employment market, particularly among junior-level cognitive workers, leading to wage deceleration. However, other economists argue that AI development should not be hindered due to deflation concerns, as the main causes of deflation are overcapacity and sluggish domestic demand. They emphasize that AI is strategically important for China's economic future and that the focus should be on curbing overinvestment and excessive competition.</p>

          <p>Students planning to enroll in the fall 2025 college semester are advised to maximize financial aid options, including grants and scholarships, before considering student loans. Federal student loans are generally recommended as the first loan option due to their generous benefits, but private student loans may be necessary to cover any remaining gaps. Obtaining a cosigner and improving credit scores and debt-to-income ratios can improve eligibility for private student loans. It's also important to shop around for the best loan terms and avoid borrowing more than needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced its key interest rate for the eighth time in just over a year, lowering it from 2.25% to 2%, while warning about the continuing pressure on the eurozone from Donald Trump's tariffs. The ECB said that trade uncertainty would weigh on business investment and exports, despite stronger-than-expected economic growth between January and March. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that a great deal of uncertainty remains over the economy, largely due to trade policies, but expects the economy to gather pace in the medium term, boosted by European spending on defense and infrastructure. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with Trump to discuss tariffs and defense spending.</p>

AOC's endorsement is seen as a strategic move to consolidate support behind a single progressive candidate, as progressives failed to unite in the previous election, leading to a moderate Democrat's victory. Mamdani advocates for policies such as free city bus rides, rent freezes, and city-run grocery stores, funded by a $10 billion tax increase on businesses and the wealthy.</p>

The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant, and those using Mounjaro with an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) can help savers earn returns that are at least equal to inflation, with strong current returns and the ability to lock in high rates for the term of the CD. Top CDs offer higher rates than the current inflation rate and are safe investments with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve, making them a practical approach for long-term savings through laddering. Online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional banks due to lower overhead costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Current mortgage and refinance interest rates remain high, but borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. A strong credit profile is essential for securing the best rates, and shopping around and comparing different lenders can help borrowers find the most favorable terms. Short-term loans generally offer better interest rates than longer terms, and borrowers should carefully consider fees and monthly payments before taking on a new loan. Locking in a mortgage rate after making a decision can provide assurance that the rate won't increase before closing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manny Pacquiao is set to face welterweight champion Mario Barrios in a fight scheduled for July 19 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, marking Pacquiao's return to the ring. The decision to challenge Barrios reflects Pacquiao's desire to retire with the WBC title, where he started in flyweight, with WBC president Mauricio Sulaim√°n helping to fulfill his dream. Despite concerns about Pacquiao's age, the boxer maintains that his hand movements are as fast as ever and that he is still capable of competing at a high level, although he is approaching the fight cautiously, considering it one at a time.</p>
