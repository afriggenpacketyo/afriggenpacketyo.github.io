        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is planning a phased restart of its manufacturing operations, beginning with its engine factory, after a significant cyber-attack halted production for over a month. The shutdown has caused severe financial strain on the company and its vast network of suppliers, some of whom were forced to lay off staff. In response, the UK government has underwritten a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support JLR's supply chain. While the resumption of operations is a positive step, experts warn that a full recovery will be a gradual and complex process for the automaker and its partners.</p>

          <p>Journalist Lesley Stahl shares her experience of interviewing the actors from the mockumentary "This is Spinal Tap" for a segment on the film's sequel. Expecting to speak with actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, she was instead met by their in-character band personas, who engaged in spontaneous, improvisational comedy. Director Rob Reiner explained that both the original film and its sequel were created without a script, relying entirely on the cast's improvisational talent. The article highlights the unique, unscripted nature of the filmmaking process that made the original a cult classic and a pioneer of the mockumentary genre.</p>

Reiner shares anecdotes about the challenges of pitching the original film and the creative freedom of working with its talented, improvisational cast.

          <p>China is making significant strides in developing high-end AI chips, aiming to reduce its dependency on U.S. technology and challenge the market dominance of companies like Nvidia. Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba and Huawei have recently unveiled powerful new semiconductors, with some claiming to match the performance of Nvidia's chips designed for the Chinese market. This push is part of a broader national strategy to become a global tech leader, accelerated by ongoing trade tensions with the United States. While experts acknowledge China's rapid progress, they note that the U.S. still maintains an edge in the most advanced chip technology and established supply chains.</p>

          <p>Police in Hawthorne, California, have arrested a 33-year-old man in connection with a series of online threats that prompted the evacuation of TikTok's headquarters in Culver City. After TikTok employees received a threatening social media message on Friday, police traced the source to the suspect's home. The man initially refused to surrender and made further threats online, leading to a 90-minute standoff with crisis negotiators. He eventually surrendered peacefully and was booked on a charge of making criminal threats, bringing a resolution to the tense situation.</p>

          <h2>India Aims to Reverse Brain Drain Amid US Visa Policy Changes</h2>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's decision to drastically increase H-1B visa fees, policymakers in India are intensifying efforts to attract skilled Indian professionals back from the United States. The move is seen as an opportunity to reverse a decades-long brain drain, with some anecdotal evidence suggesting that a more hostile U.S. immigration environment is prompting expatriates to consider returning. Headhunters report a rise in inquiries from U.S.-based Indian professionals and students exploring opportunities in India's booming tech sector. However, experts caution that a large-scale reverse migration will require a more concerted government effort to create compelling incentives for relocation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced a plan to overhaul the housing market, aiming to reduce costs for buyers, shorten transaction times, and decrease the number of failed sales. Under the proposed reforms, sellers would be legally required to provide key property information upfront, such as leasehold costs and the condition of the home, to increase transparency. The plan also considers introducing earlier binding contracts to prevent deals from collapsing late in the process, a common issue that costs the economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. These changes are intended to make the home-buying experience less stressful and more efficient for families and first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>In an interview, historian Martin Powers explains how art from imperial China provides valuable insights into societal and political norms that have parallels in modern Western societies. He argues that art is not merely a reflection of politics but an active participant in public discourse, conveying widely understood ideas about authority and social relations. Powers uses the example of a recurring story about a Han dynasty prime minister, depicted in various art forms, to show how concepts of jurisdictional authority were broadly understood by the public. He suggests that such visual evidence is crucial for understanding the social history of political ideas.</p>

          <p>This article explores the current state of investor sentiment, noting a high degree of complacency despite potential economic headwinds like a government shutdown. It identifies two primary reasons for the sustained bull market: the "Trump put," where the president's actions have consistently bolstered the market after dips, and the unprecedented dominance of Nvidia in the AI sector. The author suggests that while the market rally feels magical, investors should consider taking some profits to secure their gains from this remarkable run. The piece reflects on the speculative nature of current trading trends, particularly among a new generation of buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article advocates for China to shift its economic focus from being the world's largest exporter to becoming its largest importer over the next decade. As leaders prepare the next five-year plan, the author contends that prioritizing domestic consumption is crucial for achieving the nation's goal of becoming a "modern socialist country." Such a transition would address structural imbalances that have long favored investment and exports over internal demand. This strategic pivot would not only reshape China's economy but also have significant geopolitical implications for its global trading partners.</p>

The rescue was described as "long and difficult," hampered by appalling weather conditions and the challenging underground terrain.
