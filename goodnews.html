          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival has officially begun in west London, filling the streets with vibrant colors and sounds for its opening children's parade. The festivities started at dawn with J'ouvert, a traditional celebration involving participants covering themselves in bright paint and powder to mark the start of the weekend's events. As Europe's largest street party, the carnival continues a tradition spanning over 50 years. A 72-second silence will be observed on both days to honor the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Vence, France, have discovered an ancient baptistery dating back 1,500 years, providing new insights into early Christian rituals. The structure, found next to a previously unearthed cathedral, features an octagonal exterior and a cross-shaped interior baptismal font, which remains in very good condition. This finding confirms the antiquity of the bishopric of Vence and enhances historical knowledge of early Christian practices in the region. The excavation also revealed several burials in the cathedral's nave, believed to be those of religious figures from the Carolingian period.</p>

          <p>Ireland began their Women's World Cup campaign with a commanding 42-14 victory over Japan at Franklin's Gardens in Northampton. The Irish team demonstrated strong form by scoring six tries from six different players, securing a bonus point before halftime. Amee-Leigh Costigan, Neve Jones, Beibhinn Parsons, and Fiona Tuite scored in the first half, followed by Eve Higgins and Enya Breen in the second. Japan responded with tries from Haruka Hirotsu and Masami Kawamura, but were unable to match Ireland's impressive and coordinated performance in their Pool C opener.</p>

          <p>Despite China's significant trade relationship with the European Union, valued at around US$1 trillion, key US allies are resisting Beijing's diplomatic and economic overtures. This opinion article argues that these nations are prioritizing their foundational security alliances and intelligence-sharing pacts with Washington over potential economic gains from China. The author contends that centuries of shared identity, security integration, and cultural ties form an unbreakable bond with the United States' strategic framework. Consequently, China's efforts to create a wedge against American influence have failed to secure meaningful political alignment from these allies.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is currently moving northeast over the open ocean. As of Sunday morning, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and posed no immediate threat to land. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict that Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially reaching hurricane status by Monday before weakening.

          <p>Top U.S. envoy Thomas Barrack met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on Sunday to discuss pressing security issues concerning Lebanon and Syria. The meeting followed Barrack's recent discussions with other senior Israeli officials, including the defense minister. These talks are part of a broader, U.S.-mediated effort to de-escalate conflicts in the region, including ongoing negotiations about security arrangements in southern Syria. Barrack has also been advocating for a plan that would see the disarmament of Hezbollah in Lebanon in exchange for a cessation of Israeli military operations there.</p>

Gebbia stated his goal is to make online government services more beautiful, user-friendly, and efficient, drawing a comparison to the Apple App Store. The new studio is seen as a successor to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously headed by Elon Musk. Gebbia, who has shifted from being a major Democratic donor, aims to make the U.S. the "most beautiful, and usable, country in the digital world."</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly making their homes in urban environments across the United States, with a notable pair, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, now thriving in New York's Central Park. These adaptable animals have expanded their territory eastward over the last century due to a decline in predators and changes in land use. Researchers and local photographers are documenting the Central Park coyotes to educate the public and promote coexistence, emphasizing that the animals are not a threat if given space. This phenomenon highlights how wildlife is adjusting to live alongside humans in even the most densely populated cities.</p>

The vessel, painted in naval camouflage, also has windows on its cockpit, suggesting it can be optionally manned. This appearance signals a potential advancement in China's unmanned naval capabilities, a key area of modern military development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new TikTok trend has emerged where Gen Z users hold public contests to find the best impression of a "performative male," an archetype who adopts an alternative, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic to appeal to progressive women. This character is often seen with tote bags, feminist literature, and vinyl records, and listens to female singer-songwriters. While largely a lighthearted joke, the trend also touches on a deeper suspicion that these tastes might be a deceptive act. It reflects a broader cultural conversation about authenticity, gender performance, and the distrust present in modern dating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest one-year review, revealing that while the savings on gasoline were less than expected, the real financial benefit came from significantly lower maintenance costs. The owner spent $1,432 on charging, saving an estimated $334 on gas, but only $600 on two tire replacements after 15,000 miles, a stark contrast to the thousands spent on his previous car. This experience highlights a key advantage of electric vehicles: the long-term savings from avoiding common repairs like oil changes and transmission work. Other EV owners echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the substantial value over the vehicle's lifetime.</p>

The book details his wild experiences at USC, his brief NFL career, and his subsequent struggles with heroin.

Studies have linked regular tennis play to a longer life expectancy compared to other physical activities. Beyond physical benefits, the sport's complex demands on motor coordination, strategy, and rapid decision-making provide a significant cognitive workout, helping to buffer against age-related decline and improve reaction times.</p>

          <p>This personal essay argues that the practice of reading aloud to children, while declining in popularity, offers significant benefits not just for the child, but for the parent as well. The author describes how reading to her newborn, from Romantic poetry to simple board books, became a primary way to connect and communicate. This shared activity is framed as a way for parents to guide their children's understanding of the world, from distinguishing shapes and colors to grasping complex ideas. More profoundly, it allows a parent to witness their child's developing mind, learning to "read" their child's expressions and nascent personality.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for designing and utilizing artificial intelligence as a collaborative tool that augments human expertise, rather than as an automation tool that aims to replace it entirely. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it argues that imperfect automation can be dangerous, as it may erode human skills and fail catastrophically when it encounters unforeseen situations. A collaborative approach, where AI provides data and insights while humans provide context, judgment, and ethical oversight, leads to better outcomes. This human-in-the-loop model is presented as a more effective and safer path for integrating AI into high-stakes fields like medicine and law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores a novel concept for combating climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon as a sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government sequesters gold in Fort Knox. The idea, developed by an anthropologist and an artist, proposes creating community-based cooperative banks that accept organic waste, convert it into a stable form of carbon called biochar, and issue a local digital currency in return. This would create a grassroots system that gives value to carbon sequestration, taking it out of the environmental cycle. The authors suggest this approach could be a powerful, decentralized tool for climate action.</p>
