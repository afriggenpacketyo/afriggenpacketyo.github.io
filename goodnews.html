          <p>Kate Forbes, Scotland's Deputy First Minister, has announced she will not seek re-election in the upcoming 2026 Holyrood election. The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP cited a desire to spend more time with her young family as the primary reason for her decision to step down. Forbes, who will continue to serve as an MSP for another nine months, expressed her continued support for First Minister John Swinney and the Scottish National Party's goals. Swinney praised Forbes for her invaluable contribution to public life over the past decade, acknowledging the significant challenges of frontline politics.</p>

          <p>In a significant move to bolster maritime cooperation, India and the Philippines have conducted their first-ever joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea. The two-day patrol, involving three Indian vessels and two Filipino frigates, coincides with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos's state visit to New Delhi. This collaboration is seen as a direct response to China's expansive claims in the region and follows a series of confrontations between the Philippines and China. Filipino military officials reported being shadowed by Chinese vessels during the exercise but noted no untoward incidents occurred, expressing hope for future joint maneuvers.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in developing its domestic aviation supply chain, aiming to reduce its dependence on foreign technology for aircraft components. A key project is the CJ-1000A engine, a homegrown alternative to the CFM International engines currently used on China's C919 airliner. An official from the Chinese Academy of Engineering recently provided a positive update, stating the engine's development is progressing as planned. A successful rollout of the CJ-1000A would mark a major achievement in Beijing's long-term strategy for self-sufficiency in the highly complex and lucrative civil aviation industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for sports drinks and electrolyte powders has expanded beyond athletes into a multi-billion dollar wellness industry, but medical experts question their necessity for the average person. While these products do replenish minerals like sodium and potassium lost through sweat, most people get sufficient electrolytes from a balanced diet. The body, particularly the kidneys, is highly effective at regulating electrolyte levels, excreting any excess. Experts suggest that for most individuals, drinking plain water and eating a varied diet is adequate for hydration, and these costly supplements are only truly beneficial for those engaged in prolonged, intense sweating or suffering from severe dehydration due to illness.</p>

After her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury, she found herself overwhelmed with caregiving, business responsibilities, and household chores. While struggling to rake a yard full of leaves and feeling immense stress, her friend of 15 years, Jonathan Lilienfeld, appeared unexpectedly with a rake. He simply told her to go inside and rest, then proceeded to clear the entire yard himself, a gesture that she remembers as a heroic act of rescue that still moves her deeply.</p>

          <p>The Ann Arbor District Library in Michigan has created a highly successful "Summer Game" that has engaged thousands of residents, with over half of its 16,000 active players being adults. The game evolved from a simple reading challenge into a library-using game inspired by corporate loyalty programs, where players earn points by solving puzzles, exploring the city, and using various library services. The program's immense popularity demonstrates an innovative approach to community engagement, raising awareness of the library's diverse offerings beyond books, such as tools, art, and events. Its open-access code allows other libraries to replicate its success.</p>

          <p>The unofficial annual summer retreat for China's senior political leadership has commenced at the seaside resort of Beidaihe. The start of the gathering was signaled by the public appearance of Cai Qi, a high-ranking Communist Party official, at a meeting with technology experts and scholars at the resort. During this retreat, which typically lasts around two weeks, top leaders reduce their public appearances while engaging in informal discussions on key policy and personnel matters. Security in the area has been heightened, with a ban on drones and other low-altitude aircraft in effect for July and August.</p>

          <p>This article examines the early signs from Manchester United's pre-season tour under new manager Ruben Amorim, questioning whether they represent genuine progress or another false dawn. Amorim has introduced a more relaxed environment and new tactical approaches, including a fluid three-man defense and more intense, disguised fitness drills. While the sports science team is reportedly pleased with the players' condition, the manager knows that results are the ultimate measure of success. The team shows potential improvements, but weaknesses in midfield remain, and the upcoming Premier League season will be the true test of this new direction.</p>

          <p>South Korea has started to dismantle the loudspeakers used for broadcasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda across its border with North Korea. The country's Defense Ministry confirmed the move is a practical measure aimed at easing military tensions and is part of President Lee Jae-myung's efforts to improve relations and restore trust with the North. The action follows the new administration's decision in June to halt the broadcasts, which prompted Pyongyang to stop its own counter-broadcasts. However, North Korea recently rejected Seoul's overtures for dialogue, indicating that a reduction in tensions remains uncertain.</p>
