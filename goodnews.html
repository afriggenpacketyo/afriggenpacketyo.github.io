          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Canadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc expressed disappointment with recent U.S. tariffs but remained optimistic about reaching a deal. He emphasized the deep integration of the two economies, stating they "build things together" rather than just trade. LeBlanc defended Canada's retaliatory measures and highlighted the strategic importance of sectors like steel and aluminum for national security. He noted that constructive conversations with U.S. officials are ongoing, aiming for an agreement to reduce tariffs and provide economic certainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a self-imposed deadline, the United States and Canada have not yet reached a new trade agreement, extending a six-month tariff war. While both nations face pressure to resolve the dispute, analysts suggest Canada is not rushing into a "bad deal," partly because the existing USMCA trade pact provides a buffer, leaving most exports duty-free. Canadian officials remain publicly optimistic about continuing cordial negotiations to lower tariffs on key sectors like steel and autos. Recent Canadian policy shifts on defense spending and a digital tax may also be intended to address U.S. concerns and aid the talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This week's edition of "CBS Sunday Morning" presented its annual "Money Issue," focusing on the various facets of planning for a fulfilling retirement. Segments explored the security of the Social Security system, the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, and the growing trend of Americans retiring overseas for a lower cost of living. The program also featured stories on the cultural phenomena of bucket lists and older social media "grandfluencers."

          <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his bank's economists do not foresee a recession or Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, predicting slow but steady growth. In a "Face the Nation" interview, he noted that businesses are currently cautious, awaiting clarity on the Trump administration's policies regarding trade, deregulation, and immigration before making major investments. Moynihan also discussed the long-term impact of AI on the job market, suggesting it will enhance productivity, and addressed the recent firing of the BLS commissioner, advocating for more resilient data collection methods.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions could render a loan agreement unfair. The FCA will consult on the scheme's details, which could cover millions of agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. Consumers who believe they were affected are advised to contact their loan provider directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy menu items in an effort to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. Brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, seeing it as a low-cost, high-return strategy to boost sales amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests generate significant buzz. While effective, restaurants face the challenge of rapidly shifting youth trends, requiring constant innovation to keep their menus appealing.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old individual who was pleased to be laid off just before a planned retirement is now reconsidering their plans after an unexpected job offer from their former employer. The new role, a leadership position in a department they had always admired, comes with a good salary and crucial health benefits, a major factor given Medicare eligibility begins at 65. The situation highlights a common challenge for older workers balancing financial security, such as delaying Social Security for higher benefits, with the desire to stop working. The individual is weighing the opportunity against their commitment to retiring soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix with a masterful defensive drive against a late charge from his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy after a poor start, which put him in the lead but left him vulnerable on older tires in the final laps. Piastri, on a fresher set of tires, closed the gap and made several attempts to overtake but was unable to pass on the notoriously difficult track. The win reduces Norris's championship deficit to Piastri to just nine points, while Mercedes' George Russell finished third.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic envisions what tours at U.S. national parks might sound like if they were altered to avoid any content that could be seen as disparaging to American history. The piece humorously rewrites tour guide scripts for sites like the Stonewall National Monument, Manzanar, and the Selma to Montgomery Trail to focus only on "natural beauty" while comically sidestepping historical conflict or social justice issues. For example, the Civil War is described as being "fought over nothing," and Harriet Tubman is portrayed as a nature enthusiast. The satire critiques recent efforts to control historical narratives at national sites.</p>

          <p>China has granted export approval to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a timely alternative market for Brazil's coffee industry. The decision comes as Brazilian exporters face a new 50% U.S. tariff on their products, set to begin on August 6. The U.S. is a massive market for Brazilian coffee, importing nearly 8 million bags annually, valued at $4.4 billion over the past year. While China is a much smaller market currently, these new five-year export permits represent a significant opportunity for Brazilian producers to diversify and mitigate the impact of the U.S. trade measures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to divorce attorneys, individuals in a rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances even without a prenuptial agreement. The first key step is to become fully informed about all shared assets and liabilities while still married, as access to accountants and financial records is easier. The second recommendation is to consider a postnuptial agreement, or "postnup," which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While broaching the topic can be difficult, having these clear financial understandings can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts later on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that connection, not control, is the key to managing children's tantrums. The article outlines seven calming phrases that emotionally attuned parents use to validate a child's feelings and make them feel safe, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you." This approach avoids punishments and recognizes that a tantrum is a sign of nervous system distress. By reassuring children and setting boundaries with compassion, parents can help them regulate their emotions more effectively and reduce the frequency of future meltdowns.</p>

The plan, which could be operational within weeks, reportedly aims to allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free medical care. This follows criticism from the Foreign Affairs Committee that the government had previously declined to support such a medical evacuation scheme. A British charity, Project Pure Hope, has already privately brought three children to the UK for treatment and welcomed the government's new initiative.</p>
