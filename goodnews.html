          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration from prematurely ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits this September, months ahead of the previously established February 2026 expiration. The judge determined that the DHS secretary lacks the statutory authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. This decision provides temporary relief and stability for Haitians who have built lives in the U.S. relying on the existing designation.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant change in the company's contract chip manufacturing strategy to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia. The potential shift involves deprioritizing the marketing of its 18A manufacturing process, a technology heavily backed by the previous CEO, which has faced delays. Instead, resources would focus on the next-generation 14A process, where Intel believes it can gain a competitive edge over rival TSMC. This move could result in a substantial financial write-off but is being considered as a necessary step to revive the U.S. chipmaker's foundry business.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the United States' strictest law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," was named after Amara Strande, a 20-year-old who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to the chemicals. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The effort was a poignant victory for Strande's family and activists, leading to a landmark environmental health policy in the state where PFAS were first developed.</p>

Microsoft's success was driven by a rebound in its Azure cloud growth, while Nvidia overcame a rocky start to rally hard on the persistent, unrivaled demand for its AI chips. Meta's strong performance was attributed to its powerful advertising business, which blew past earnings estimates. The analysis suggests these three companies have distinguished themselves from their megacap peers through superior execution and market dominance in their respective sectors.

Experts believe the country is on track to meet its annual GDP growth target of around 5 percent. However, significant challenges are anticipated in the second half of the year, with some analysts forecasting that export growth will slow to zero or even contract. This is attributed to the front-loading of orders earlier in the year and a projected slowdown in US consumer spending, indicating a difficult path ahead for Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

This public consultation could lead to a significant shift in the iconography of UK currency.

          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in decades, a move aimed at accelerating housing construction. Championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the changes largely waive CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. This eliminates a major tool that opponents have used for years to delay or block development through lengthy studies and lawsuits. The reform signals a seismic shift in state politics, prioritizing housing abundance over processes that have historically stifled construction and contributed to the affordability crisis.</p>
