          <p>Bill Gates plans to donate the majority of his remaining wealth to the Gates Foundation, which will close in 2045, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's philosophy on wealth. The foundation will spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years to combat preventable deaths of mothers and children, eradicate infectious diseases, and promote prosperity through education. Gates expressed concern that U.S. and European foreign aid cuts could hinder progress, potentially leading to an increase in childhood deaths. He hopes his efforts will inspire others to address global issues, marking this as the final chapter of his career.</p>

          <p>This article is a review of the British comedy game show Taskmaster, where comedians compete in absurd challenges judged by Greg Davies and Alex Horne. The author, initially skeptical due to their past experiences with similar British panel shows, was won over by the show's unique blend of silly challenges and comedic performances. The show's format involves both in-studio and on-location tasks, with the latter often being bizarre and open to interpretation, which leads to hilarious and unexpected outcomes. The review emphasizes the show's ability to expand its comedic sensibilities, such as including an American comedian, and its reinvention through new participants and tasks each season.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to maintain steady interest rates, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump labeled Powell a "fool" and expressed frustration that the Fed was not lowering rates to stimulate the economy. The Fed indicated that it would keep rates unchanged until the economic outlook became clearer, fearing that Trump's tariffs could trigger inflation. Powell has stated that Trump's criticisms would not influence the Fed's decisions.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. This pledge, estimated at $107 billion, will allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years, focusing on global health and education. Gates stated that spending down his fortune will save and improve many lives now, with the aim of addressing issues like polio, malaria, and malnutrition, while also allowing wealthy donors to tackle other problems later. Melinda French Gates left the foundation in 2024 to focus on her own organization.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article analyzes the potential impact of a trade deal between Britain and the United States, noting that it could boost certain sectors and improve consumer confidence. The agreement is expected to ease the impact of recent U.S. tariff increases, particularly benefiting Britain's auto industry. However, the article cautions that the deal's overall effect on the British economy may be limited, as trade flows are heavily skewed toward services. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, citing trade uncertainty as a concern for economic growth.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members can attend his upcoming trial for the Idaho student murders, even if they are called to testify. The judge balanced Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony. He determined that the family's presence would advance the values of a public trial and that the scope of their potential testimony is narrow, with previous recorded interviews helping to prevent altered statements.</p>
