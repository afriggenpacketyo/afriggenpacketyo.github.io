          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, praising his "courage, urgency and optimism" in a New York Times opinion piece. Despite past disagreements, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's commitment to safe neighborhoods, affordability, and a strong stance against Donald Trump's agenda. This endorsement from the moderate governor is significant as Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has recently apologized for past controversial remarks, signaling a strategic shift. The competitive mayoral race also features incumbent Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, with other prominent Democrats yet to declare their support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high of 3,420.23, marking its tenth consecutive session of gains, after Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol announced the government would scrap its plan to raise taxes on stock investments. This decision provided a significant boost to investor confidence, influencing positive trading across Asia-Pacific markets despite mixed performances elsewhere. The small-cap Kosdaq also saw gains, while regional markets assessed ongoing US-China trade talks in Spain and recent Chinese economic data. The reversal of the tax-hike plan is a key factor driving this market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 627, the "No Secret Police Act," which bans most local and federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces during operations. The bill, now headed to Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to boost transparency and public trust, especially in response to increased immigration enforcement under President Trump. Supporters argue it prevents impersonation and ensures accountability, citing concerns about officers being "confused with the guy in the ski mask robbing a liquor store." However, opponents, including law enforcement associations, express concerns about officer safety and operational realities, though the bill includes exemptions for specific situations like SWAT teams and medical masks.</p>

          <p>Bobby Hart, a prolific songwriter integral to The Monkees' success, has died at 86, leaving behind a legacy of hits like "Last Train to Clarksville" and "I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone." Alongside Tommy Boyce, Hart not only penned many of their biggest songs but also served as a producer, shaping the band's distinctive sound. Their collaboration extended to political activism and other projects, including the theme for "Days of Our Lives." Hart's memoir, "Psychedelic Bubblegum," chronicled his journey from a shy Phoenix native to a celebrated musician whose work was covered by diverse artists from Dean Martin to the Sex Pistols.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease researchers hail as a world-first in fighting a leading cause of death for the beloved marsupials. Developed over a decade by the University of the Sunshine Coast, the vaccine does not require a booster and aims to reduce the rapid spread of chlamydia, which causes blindness, starvation, and infertility. Unlike antibiotics, this vaccine offers three levels of protection—reducing infection, preventing progression, and reversing existing symptoms. This widespread approval provides significant hope for koala conservation, particularly in areas with high infection rates.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are navigating the critical final two weeks of the MLB regular season with significant playoff implications, currently poised for a wild-card round rather than a division series bye. President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman emphasized the strategic advantage of a bye, allowing for player recovery and optimal pitching rotation, despite the team's past division series losses. The upcoming series against the Philadelphia Phillies is crucial for improving their seeding, while the close race with the San Diego Padres for the NL West title adds another layer of complexity, potentially influencing home-field advantage.</p>

This initiative, expected to be signed during President Trump's state visit, seeks to streamline regulatory approvals, cutting licensing periods, and foster commercial partnerships. Key projects include X-Energy and Centrica's plan for up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool and Holtec, EDF, and Tritax's £11bn nuclear-powered data center hub in Nottinghamshire. Both nations aim to enhance energy security, meet rising demand from AI, and end reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028, heralding a "golden age of nuclear."</p>

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience often linked to stress or busy lifestyles. While not a medical condition itself, it signifies an overstretched or tired brain, often striking after a busy period. Medical experts offer practical tips, including deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities to allow for mental reset and processing, acting as "mental buffers." Recognizing brain fog as a temporary state and giving oneself permission to slow down, delegate tasks, or seek help are crucial steps toward improving mental clarity and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system, despite a recent 3-0 derby loss. While the team shows tactical improvements in compactness and defensive shape, individual mistakes in conceding goals are proving costly. Murphy specifically highlights Bruno Fernandes playing a deeper midfield role, where his defensive instincts are lacking, and Luke Shaw being shoe-horned into a center-back position. He contends that despite a decent start to the season, these personnel issues lead to a stack-up of errors, preventing the team from maximizing its potential and causing ongoing instability.</p>
