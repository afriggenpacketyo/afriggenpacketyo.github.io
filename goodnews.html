          <p>Chinese researchers are actively training and testing robotic dogs in a simulated lunar environment, preparing them for future exploration of the moon's underground. A cave system near Jingbo Lake in Heilongjiang province, formed by ancient lava flows, offers conditions "strikingly similar" to the lunar subsurface, making it an ideal testing ground for these advanced machines. The robot dogs are specifically designed to act as "scouts," reliably executing surveying tasks in narrow, challenging sections that human explorers cannot easily access. This pioneering work aims to significantly advance embodied intelligence technologies, crucial for enhancing deep-space exploration capabilities and potentially establishing future human lunar bases, underscoring China's ambitious space agenda.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's Amap mapping application achieved a record 360 million daily users on the inaugural day of China's "golden week" National Day holiday. This significant surge underscores Alibaba's strategic focus on bolstering Amap's local service offerings, intensifying its competition with food delivery giant Meituan in the expansive sector connecting consumers with offline services like restaurant bookings, meal deliveries, and hotel reservations. The company recently introduced "Amap Street Stars," an AI-powered feature designed to rank various offline destinations by integrating navigation patterns and user reviews. This initiative aims to strengthen Amap's market presence and capitalize on increased domestic travel during major holidays.</p>

          <p>European defense giants are actively welcoming the continent's push to establish a multi-layered "drone wall" on its eastern flank, recognizing it as a critical measure against rapidly escalating security threats. Following recent airspace incursions near Russia, EU leaders are discussing the financing and operation of this flagship defense policy. Companies like Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall have voiced their support, emphasizing the urgent need for collaborative European efforts to address the drone challenge. While the industry is ready to contribute, concerns have been raised regarding potential bureaucratic hurdles and the complexity of integrating diverse sensors and countermeasures, alongside the risk of drones launched from within EU territory.</p>

          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of Hugging Face, asserts that current artificial intelligence models, such as those from OpenAI, are unlikely to produce major scientific breakthroughs comparable to Nobel Prize-level discoveries. He contrasts this view with claims from prominent AI figures like Sam Altman. Wolf identifies two key limitations: chatbots' tendency to align with user prompts and their design to predict the "most likely next word." He argues that true scientific breakthroughs often come from contrarian thinking and predicting novel, unlikely truths, rather than merely synthesizing existing information. While AI can serve as a "co-pilot" for research, enabling scientists to generate new ideas, it currently lacks the capacity for independent, revolutionary conceptual leaps.</p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK Education Secretary and deputy leadership candidate, has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact," signaling the government's potential readiness to lift the policy. Introduced by the Conservatives, the cap restricts universal or child tax credit payments for third or subsequent children born after April 2017. Phillipson emphasized the "real urgency" of addressing the issue, as child poverty rates continue to rise under the current system. Reports suggest the Treasury is considering alternatives, including a tapered system, to replace the cap, which campaigners argue would lift nearly half a million children out of poverty if abolished.</p>
