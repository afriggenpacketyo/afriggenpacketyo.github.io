          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released on bail after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release, citing a violation of her due process and First Amendment rights, stemming from an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk, along with Sen. Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, thanked her community for their support and expressed faith in the American justice system. The article highlights the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's decision to revoke her visa based on the op-ed, sparking concerns about free speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that "great progress" was made during trade negotiations with China in Geneva, describing the agreement as "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner." The talks, involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and a Chinese delegation, addressed the intense tariff battle between the two nations. While specifics remain scarce, Trump emphasized the goal of opening up China to American business, asserting that fair duties could address the nation's trade deficit and encourage the return of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Bessent previously suggested that the tariffs could cost China millions of jobs, rendering them unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by targeting lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but increased transactions, attributed to efforts to defend market share. The company has expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets, with operating revenue rising 5%. This article notes the importance of monitoring Starbucks' expansion beyond wealthier cities. The growth of coffee shops is concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities", like Chengdu and Hangzhou, signaling a shift in the coffee market landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global trade tensions rise, Chinese consumers are increasingly favoring domestic brands as an expression of resilience and national pride. This shift reflects a deeper transition towards a domestically-driven consumption economy, driven by rising protectionism and slowing globalization. Consumption in China has evolved into an emotional and cultural act, with consumers buying into stories, values, and symbols associated with domestic brands. Market data indicates a surge in preference for local brands, particularly in sectors like technology, fashion, and consumer goods, reflecting a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation and shape a modern national identity.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr is retiring due to a labral tear and degenerative changes in his right shoulder. The injury, discovered during offseason training, would jeopardize the 2025 season and not guarantee a full recovery. Carr, a four-time Pro Bowler, retires with 41,245 passing yards and 257 touchdowns after 11 seasons, and cited prayer and family consultation in his decision. Following Carr's retirement, the Saints will provide Tyler Shough, their high second-round draft pick, with the opportunity to compete for the starting position, alongside Spencer Rattler and Jake Haener.</p>

          <p>An atmospheric river event is forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the Southeastern United States, with potential for 4 to 6 inches of rain and isolated spots seeing up to 12 inches.

This event, originating from the Gulf of Mexico, is unusual as atmospheric rivers typically affect the Western U.S., and the scientist in the article noted the risk of flooding, urging residents to take precautions in flood-prone areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts weigh in on the formula for Eurovision success, considering factors like song theme, staging, key, and surprise elements. Lyrical themes often revolve around love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history, and music, with self-empowering songs performing well. Simple and effective staging is preferred over overly elaborate productions, and the increasing dominance of minor-key songs suggests an association with emotional depth. A surprise twist, such as a key change or costume reveal, can also enhance a song's catchiness and memorability.</p>
