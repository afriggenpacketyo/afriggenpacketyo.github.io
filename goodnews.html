          <p>Charles Michel, former President of the European Council, urged the EU to manage its competition with China responsibly, advocating for a relationship independent of other world powers' influence.

Michel's comments come amidst easing strains between Europe and China, with both sides lifting restrictions on reciprocal exchanges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining friendships can be challenging after children enter the picture, with assumptions often made about availability and interests. Culture writer Anne Helen Petersen suggests open communication and compassion are essential for bridging the gap between parents and non-parents. Justin Kellough advises clear communication about availability, while Petersen encourages parents to invite child-free friends to family events to foster deeper connections. Addressing exclusion and balancing conversation topics are also important for maintaining inclusive and fulfilling friendships, adapting to new routines, and having open conversations about feelings of being ignored or unsupported.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its Maps service, following a decree by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that Google should label the Mexican territorial waters as the Gulf of Mexico, and only use the new name for the part corresponding to the U.S. territory. Google claims the changes align with its policy of following official U.S. government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). Mexico's Foreign Ministry had previously requested Google not to label Mexican waters as the Gulf of America.</p>

          <p>President Trump is prioritizing business deals in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE during his Middle East trip, as his administration struggles to broker an end to the war in Gaza. Saudi Arabia has pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S., while the UAE plans to spend $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The trip mirrors Trump's first foreign trip, with lavish ceremonies and investment announcements. However, achieving policy goals like ending the Gaza conflict and persuading Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel faces challenges, making business deals more crucial for Trump to showcase successes.</p>

          <h2>Teenage Footballer Banned for Transgender Comment Wants Apology</h2>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is demanding an apology from the Football Association after being banned over remarks she made to a transgender woman opponent. The ban was imposed for improper conduct after she asked the rival player if they were a man during a friendly match. An FA appeal board found that Vaughan had received an "unfair" hearing, quashed the original ruling, and ordered a new process to take place. The case has since been dropped after the complainant withdrew from the process.</p>
