          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment (NCA) report, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) are soliciting research to maintain the report's momentum. The NCA report is crucial for projecting future climate impacts and informing decision-making related to infrastructure and disaster preparedness. Despite the administration's efforts to slash funding and eliminate offices responsible for the report, these scientific organizations aim to fill the gap and ensure that climate science continues to advance. The previous NCA report in 2023 highlighted the detrimental effects of climate change on health and well-being.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform known for ultra-discounted items, has altered its U.S. business model in response to the Trump administration's termination of the de minimis rule and increased tariffs on China. The company is now focusing on products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses, as items shipped directly from China are labeled as out of stock. A Temu spokesperson stated that this change aims to improve service levels and help local merchants reach more customers, while maintaining unchanged pricing for U.S. shoppers. Before the change, shoppers faced import charges of 130% to 150% on items shipped from China.</p>

          <p>A new law firm, Lowell & Associates, has been launched to represent individuals and institutions allegedly "unlawfully and inappropriately targeted" by the Trump administration. The firm's clients include whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former Trump administration employee Miles Taylor. The firm aims to provide legal representation and counsel to those facing politicized investigations, civil, and administrative actions. Brenna Trout Frey, another attorney at the firm, resigned from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom after the firm struck a $100 million dollar deal with Trump to avoid being targeted.</p>

Kyiv will contribute 50% of revenues from new licenses for extracting raw materials to the fund.

These numbers were based on surveys taken after the Trump administration's move to institute high tariffs on imports. Analysts say the eventual effect of high tariffs on the labor market will be fully felt in the weeks and months to come.
