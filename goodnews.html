          <p>The Trump administration has announced a framework deal with China that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, narrowly avoiding a nationwide ban. The agreement comes after a 2024 law required the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations due to persistent national security concerns over data access and the potential for propaganda dissemination. While specific terms of the deal remain confidential, officials have confirmed that any final agreement would necessitate a sale to a U.S.-based owner to address these security risks. President Trump is expected to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the crucial details of the arrangement.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors is proposing a new 10-year compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion, potentially making him the world's first trillionaire. The plan is contingent on Musk leading the company to an unprecedented $8.5 trillion valuation and meeting specific operational goals. This proposal comes as Musk's attention is divided among his various companies and political activities. The board argues the "one-of-a-kind compensation" is necessary to incentivize Musk to dedicate his talents to Tesla, reflecting a belief that his presence is critical to the company's ambitious growth targets.

          <p>At New York Fashion Week, sustainable fashion brand Collina Strada presented its Spring/Summer 2026 collection, "Shade," which creatively explored the concept of the Jungian "shadow self." Designer Hillary Taymour's show featured pastel-colored looks paired with black-clad counterparts, symbolizing the concealed, animalistic parts of human nature. The theme was amplified by avant-garde beauty choices, including hair-constructed beanies and caps by hairstylist Mustafa Yanaz and feline-inspired makeup by Isamaya Ffrench. The collection's gritty and imaginative aesthetic urged the audience to reckon with both the light and darkness within themselves.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill that will create a legal "duty of candour," compelling public officials to cooperate truthfully with investigations into major disasters. The legislation is named for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, where 97 football fans died and subsequent investigations were systematically marred by police cover-ups and false narratives. Campaigners, including families of the victims who fought for decades, have welcomed the news, hoping it will prevent others from enduring similar prolonged struggles for justice. The law aims to end the "culture of cover-ups" seen in other national tragedies.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses AI to generate short audio summaries of product information for shoppers. The AI's large language model pulls data from product catalogs, web information, and the vast trove of customer reviews to create the voiced descriptions, aiming to simplify the shopping experience. This move raises questions about whether an AI can capture the nuance and specific insights that shoppers glean from reading individual human reviews. The technology could eventually evolve into a conversational AI agent, further personalizing the e-commerce process for consumers.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure provider for artificial intelligence, jumped nearly 8% after the company disclosed a major order from Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. Under the long-term agreement, which extends through April 2032, Nvidia is obligated to purchase any of CoreWeave's unsold computing capacity. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, is a massive customer for Nvidia's GPUs, renting them out to clients to meet soaring AI demand. The deal underscores the immense and sustained investment in the infrastructure powering the artificial intelligence industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Zohran Mamdani Leading NYC Mayoral Race, Driven by Cost of Living Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 17:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, with voters overwhelmingly citing the city's unaffordability as their top concern. The poll suggests a strong desire for a candidate who can bring change over one with experience, which benefits Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo performs better among the smaller group of voters focused on crime. The influence of President Trump is also a notable factor, as many voters, particularly Mamdani's supporters, want a mayor who will oppose the president. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails significantly.</p>

          <p>After a difficult first quarter that was its worst since 2022, Tesla's stock has rallied dramatically, rising 85% from its April low to turn positive for the year. The rebound follows a period of slumping sales attributed to an aging product line, increased competition, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities. In recent weeks, investor sentiment has improved, boosted by a proposed new pay plan for Musk, the rollout of new MegaBlocks battery storage systems, and a recent $1 billion stock purchase by Musk himself, signaling renewed confidence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, a change that would require SEC approval. In a social media post, Trump argued the move would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. This revives an idea he floated during his first term, which aligns with proposals from figures like Warren Buffett who have criticized the unhealthy focus on quarterly results. The proposal contrasts with the current system, which is valued by many investors for its transparency and timeliness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has disclosed the purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock, his first open-market buy since February 2020 and his largest ever by value. The significant insider acquisition is being widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future prospects. The purchase comes as shareholders are set to vote on a new, potentially massive pay package for Musk and as the company's stock continues to recover from a slump earlier in the year. Analysts see the move as Musk "doubling down" on his bet on Tesla's AI-driven future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to reach a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining the exclusive ranks of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The stock surged following a recent antitrust ruling where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared, significantly boosting shareholder confidence. Despite facing increased competition in the AI space and significant regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, the company's shares are up more than 30% this year. The milestone marks a significant moment for the company, roughly 20 years after its initial public offering.</p>
