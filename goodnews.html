          <p>Former Philadelphia Phillies player John Kruk revealed during a Phillies TV broadcast that he once threatened to kill MLB umpire Brian O‚ÄôNora during a game near the end of his career. The incident occurred in 1995 when Kruk, playing for the Chicago White Sox, became frustrated with a strikeout call by O‚ÄôNora in the top of the ninth inning. Kruk admitted his frustrations boiled over due to a slump at the plate, leading to the heated exchange with the umpire who was in his third year at the time. Kruk spent six seasons with the Phillies, achieving a .309/.400/.461 slash line with 62 home runs.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" has made over six figures by reporting idling vehicles through New York City's Citizens Air Complaint Program. This program allows citizens to report trucks and non-city buses that idle for more than three minutes, with reporters receiving 25% of the fines, which typically range from $350 to $600. The law, initiated by George Pakenham, aims to address air pollution, with New York City having made just under $70 million from the program. While some truck drivers view the program as a "bounty hunter" scheme, Pakenham maintains that it is a crucial public health measure.</p>

The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures to do so.

The initiative aims to prevent the spread of these parasites, which can cause significant damage to livestock, pets, and wildlife.

Irons sued the district in 2019, alleging she was bullied and verbally assaulted by three students from November 2017 to June 2018, with the bullying escalating despite her reporting it to school officials.
