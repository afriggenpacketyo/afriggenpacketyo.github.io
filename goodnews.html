          <p>British energy company Shell reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite the impact of lower global oil and gas prices. The company also announced it will continue its shareholder return program, with another $3.5 billion in share buybacks planned for the next three months. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the performance amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment, highlighting the company's ongoing transformation and cost-reduction efforts. The positive results and consistent buybacks were well-received by investors, causing Shell's shares to rise (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are reportedly showing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. According to Malaysia's Transport Minister, the long waiting times for aircraft delivery from the two major manufacturers are prompting regional carriers to seek faster and more affordable options. China is actively promoting its C919 aircraft, made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), to meet growing air travel demand in Southeast Asia. This interest signals a potential diversification in aircraft procurement within the region's aviation industry.</p>

The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the jewels, facilitating their return for permanent public display in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the repatriation as a proud moment for the country's cultural heritage, bringing the relics home after 127 years.</p>

          <p>Astronauts from China's Shenzhou-19 mission have revealed that their record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Mission commander Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a crucial docking mechanism for external experiments and maintenance, became unexpectedly jammed during an installation procedure outside the spacecraft. Due to the unplanned nature of the problem and time constraints, the crew had to devise a solution on the spot without specialized tools. They successfully resolved the issue in collaboration with the ground control team, highlighting their ability to handle unforeseen challenges during complex missions.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in California's Fresno County, but the pilot managed to eject safely and was unharmed. The incident occurred near Naval Air Station Lemoore, which confirmed the aircraft belonged to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" squadron, a unit that trains pilots on the F-35 platform. The crash, which is now under investigation, caused a small grass fire that burned approximately a dozen acres before being contained by Cal Fire. No other personnel were reported to be affected by the crash, and the primary focus remains on determining the cause of the incident.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have made a minor move ahead of the MLB trade deadline, participating in a three-team deal with the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The Dodgers acquired left-handed pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski from the Reds, along with reliever Paul Gervase and catcher Ben Rortvedt from the Rays. In exchange, they sent minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. While not the major splash some fans were anticipating, the trade adds a promising young arm in Serwinowski to their farm system.
