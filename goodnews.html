          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old from Dacula, Georgia, was celebrated after helping his Burger King coworkers on his graduation night. Instead of enjoying his night off, Baker, still wearing his graduation sash and medals, jumped behind the counter to assist his colleagues, who were overwhelmed with orders. Maria Mendoza, a customer, captured the act on video and started a crowdfunding campaign to reward Baker's dedication. The campaign has raised over $200,000, which Baker plans to use to attend trade school and become a master auto mechanic, and the Burger King Foundation also surprised Baker and Mendoza with $10,000 each.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement, with both countries aiming to strike a deal by mid-June. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, stated that "further progress" had been made after talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Japan has been pushing for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, while presenting a package of proposals including cooperation in supply chains, shipbuilding, and expanding imports of U.S. farm products, though both countries have yet to find common ground on tariff issues.</p>

The CalAssist Mortgage Fund, launching on June 12, provides grants to displaced homeowners whose homes are uninhabitable due to disasters. The program recognizes disasters that received a state of emergency declaration or a major disaster declaration between January 2023 and January 2025, including the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles. The grant is paid directly to the mortgage service provider and does not have to be repaid, and funds for the program are limited, with applications reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
