          <p>Following negotiations, Israel and Hamas have reportedly approved the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, initiating a ceasefire and the release of all hostages. The initial stage involves an Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line, followed by Hamas releasing its remaining live hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel will release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners and allow hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily to address the ongoing famine.</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a novel self-healing interface that could significantly advance the commercialization of all-solid-state batteries. This new technology functions like a liquid seal, maintaining tight contact between internal battery layers without requiring the heavy external pressure that has been a major obstacle. Experts not involved in the study have hailed the development as a resolution to a key bottleneck, marking a decisive step toward practical application for these next-generation power sources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law in California that will prohibit streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials at a significantly higher volume than the program content. The bill, inspired by a new parent's complaint about a loud ad waking their baby, closes a loophole in the 2010 federal CALM Act, which only applied to broadcast television. As California's market is so large, this state law is expected to lead to nationwide changes in streaming ad volume when it takes effect in July 2026.</p>

The tiny, implantable monitors, donated by Medtronic, record data on heart rate, temperature, and hydration, providing crucial insights into the animals' stress levels and overall health. This innovative application of medical technology allows researchers to assess which animals are best suited for reintroduction into the wild and monitor how wild populations are affected by human encroachment.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. The judge found the Department of Homeland Security's justification for the deployment, which cited an organized rebellion, to be unreliable and lacking credible evidence. The ruling stated that introducing troops would likely escalate tensions and that local law enforcement has the situation under control, marking a significant legal challenge to the president's authority to militarize cities.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was scheduled to be put to death for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. Roberson's defense has long argued his conviction was based on a flawed "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis, presenting new expert testimony that the child died from pneumonia. The court has ordered a review of the case under a Texas "junk science" law, which allows for relief if the scientific evidence used in a conviction is no longer considered credible.</p>

          <p>A nearly complete fossil skeleton discovered on Dorset's Jurassic Coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, a prehistoric marine reptile. Named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or "sword dragon of Dorset," the dolphin-sized creature is the only known example of its kind and lived approximately 185 million years ago. Analysis of the fossil reveals a long, sword-like snout and suggests the animal may have been killed by a bite to the head from a larger predator, providing a rare glimpse into a period with few ichthyosaur remains.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom makes it illegal for veterinarians in California to declaw cats, except in cases of medical necessity for the animal's health. The procedure, which involves amputating the first bone of a cat's toes, has been described by advocates and lawmakers as an inhumane and outdated mutilation performed for owner convenience. While the California Veterinary Medical Association opposed the bill, arguing it limits professional scope, the state follows New York in banning the controversial practice.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of three bills designed to crack down on the deceptive sale of puppies in California and protect consumers. The new laws ban online marketplaces for dog brokers, void purchase contracts that require nonrefundable deposits, and increase transparency by requiring sellers to disclose breeder details and medical histories. The legislation was prompted by an investigation that revealed how puppies from out-of-state commercial breeders were being sold by resellers posing as small, local operators.</p>

          <p>Recent studies confirm that spending time in nature offers measurable physiological and psychological health benefits, with maximum impact often achieved after just 20 minutes. Being outdoors can trigger the autonomic nervous system to relax, lowering blood pressure and heart rate, while also reducing levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Furthermore, exposure to organic compounds from plants and soil can boost the immune system and introduce beneficial bacteria to the gut microbiome, enhancing overall well-being.</p>
