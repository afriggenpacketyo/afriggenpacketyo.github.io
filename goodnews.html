          <h2>Apple's New Software Design Sparks User Debate Over Aesthetics and Functionality</h2>

          <p>Apple's latest software redesign, dubbed Liquid Glass, has ignited controversy among users who find the translucent backgrounds difficult to read and see clearly. While some critics have voiced concerns about straying from Steve Jobs' original design principles, Apple is taking user feedback into account during the beta-testing phase. Apple Intelligence features, including AI-summarized notifications and the Clean Up tool for photos, have received mixed reviews, while the revamped Siri has faced delays. Despite facing lawsuits over false advertising related to Apple Intelligence, Apple executives are defending their measured approach to AI development, emphasizing privacy and user experience over rushing to market. The company aims to make the best version of new technology rather than being the first to release it, providing a safe haven from over-experimentation with AI, and allowing users to enjoy their iPhones without relying on half-formed AI tools. The new look is coming to all of the latest Apple devices in the fall. Optimism is tempered by user concerns and development delays.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is requesting extensive election data from Colorado, including all records related to the 2024 federal elections and preservation of records from the 2020 election. Voting experts and officials have expressed concern over the unusual nature of the request, especially given President Trump's past false claims about elections. Recent polling shows conflicting public opinion on Trump's deportation policies, indicating unpredictability and potential for swaying public sentiment. The Trump administration also plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, a move criticized for undermining efforts to combat climate change. A Republican proposal aims to penalize colleges with students who leave with unmanageable student loan debt, potentially saving the government billions over the next decade.</p>

Japan seeks a mutually beneficial agreement that promotes economic growth and stability. The negotiations are focused on market access for industrial and agricultural goods, lower tariffs, and other non-tariff barriers.</p>

Japan is committed to maintaining communication with China at various levels to ensure maritime safety and prevent future incidents.

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, with food inflation dropping significantly to 0.99%. This is the lowest level of headline inflation since February 2019. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has relaxed monetary policy, cutting its benchmark repo rate to 5.50%. Nomura economists predict subdued CPI for fiscal year 2026, citing softened commodity prices and influx of cheap Chinese goods. India's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ended March. (not investment advice)</p>

The toy's global fan base is seen as a testament to Chinese companies' commitment to long-term innovation and the growing global recognition of Chinese creative products. Pop Mart, which collaborates with artists to produce toy characters, saw its overseas revenue rise significantly, accounting for nearly 40% of its total revenue.

          <p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is urging President Trump to reverse course on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut government spending, following a public dispute between Trump and Elon Musk. Warren, along with Representative Melanie Stansbury, outlined DOGE's failures and proposed alternative recommendations that could save over $2 trillion in 10 years. Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen, eliminating waste in federal charter school programs, reforming the estate tax exemption, and negotiating better Defense Department contracts. The letter comes after Musk's opposition to a budget bill central to Trump's agenda led to a public feud, despite Musk initially pledging to cut significant government spending.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Jewish scholars argues that Harvard University is engaging in discriminatory practices by assuming all Jewish people share identical views about Israel and Zionism. They claim that Harvard's approach conflates criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jewish people, thereby erasing the diversity of Jewish thought and experience. This erasure has consequences for Jewish students and faculty who don't conform to Harvard's preferred stereotype, such as those who support Palestinian rights. The scholars call on Harvard and other universities to abandon efforts to enforce political orthodoxy in Jewish communities and to treat Jewish people as complex individuals capable of thinking for themselves. The scholars support Harvard's legal challenge to federal overreach but reject the university's characterization of its own censorship as necessary protection for Jewish students.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans found that the collective rituals of the day, such as flares, fireworks, and singing, were more emotionally intense than the actual game. The article argues that football should be understood as a collective ritual, a public theater of identity, and a long-running participatory soap opera, with the game itself being just one element. Watching football elicits a diversity of emotions, and neurophysiology alone cannot capture the full experience. Football's collectivities and communitarian cultures offer a sense of belonging in an increasingly individualized world, generating comprehensible narratives and occasional moments of scintillating drama.</p>

          <p>Despite initial consternation from Israeli leaders, a new nuclear deal between the Trump administration and Iran could be the least bad option for Israel among a host of poor choices. While hard-line Israelis prefer the total dismantlement of Iran's centrifuges, analysts suggest that a negotiated settlement could allow Israel to build on its advantage by pursuing closer ties to Arab states. A deal that draws in Gulf states would better integrate Iran into the region's economy, potentially de-radicalizing its foreign policy. The alternative to a deal is a direct war between Iran and Israel, with unpredictable consequences, which is why even pro-Israel figures in the Iranian opposition oppose military strikes on Iran.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is set to kick off in the United States with an expanded format, featuring 32 teams and generating significant revenue. However, the new format has faced criticism due to the already overcrowded football calendar and the potential for increased player injuries. The tournament's scheduling also conflicts with other major football events, such as the Gold Cup and the Women's Euros. Ticket sales have been slow, and the restrictive entry policies introduced by the Trump administration may deter some foreign fans from attending.

The pause in noise blasting is a positive step towards de-escalation and promoting dialogue between the two Koreas.</p>

          <p>China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducted a sea trial and joined a military drill in late May in areas of the Yellow Sea where Chinese and South Korean exclusive economic zones overlap, according to South Korean media reports. The Fujian, China's largest warship, is equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system. Launched in 2022, the carrier reportedly underwent its eighth trial and is expected to enter service later this year. The drill highlights China's growing naval capabilities and its strategic interests in the region.</p>

          <p>Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island erupted for the 25th time since December, spewing lava fountains reaching heights of over 330 feet. The latest event was preceded by gas-pistoning, causing the lava surface to rise before erupting. The USGS has set up livestreams to monitor the volcano. The USGS warned of high levels of volcanic gas that can have far-reaching effects downwind, causing respiratory problems and vog. Additional hazards include Pele's hair and other volcanic fragments that can fall on the ground near the eruptive vents.</p>
