          <h2>China's Export-Oriented Factory Activity Shows Unexpected Expansion in June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 22:42:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, driven primarily by a rebound in export orders as businesses may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariff hikes. This divergence is explained by the different sample sizes and focus areas of the two surveys, with the Caixin survey covering smaller, export-oriented firms. While the data suggests some resilience, economists note that momentum could soften as front-loading tapers off. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills aimed at accelerating construction by reducing environmental review standards. The legislation, which faced opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions, exempts most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Newsom compelled the passage of one key bill by tying it to the state budget, a move seen as a demonstration of his political strength. Experts believe these reforms to CEQA could be the most substantial in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects stalled by regulations.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has agreed to rescind a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies after facing pressure from President Donald Trump. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Carney "caved" to Trump, who had threatened to raise tariffs and had called off trade talks over the issue. The proposed 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, generating an estimated C$5.9 billion over five years. Canadian officials confirmed the tax was dropped as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some California National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations. The request involves moving 200 of the 4,000 troops, who were deployed by the Trump administration to handle protests, to help as the state anticipates an early and active fire season. This deployment has been a point of contention between President Trump and Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was illegal and depleted firefighting resources. The potential shift in duties comes as state officials warned the Guard's firefighting force was at reduced capacity.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a key messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The study suggests that it may be possible to develop anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise by targeting this pathway.</p>

However, some observers question the long-term viability of this rural cafe craze.

Finney-Smith had been a significant contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, averaged 6.9 points and shot 42.3% from three-point range last season with Memphis and Sacramento, and is expected to help fill the void left by Finney-Smith's departure.</p>

He argues these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policies and are more attracted to innovative concepts, such as Robinhood's use of blockchain for trading. According to Cramer, this has led to a "story-dominated market" where companies like Reddit and DoorDash are rewarded for their potential growth narratives.

Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with over two million sellers, helps keep prices stable, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share.
