        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to introduce legally binding targets to combat waste, aiming to cut food waste from households, restaurants, and retailers by 30% by 2030. The new directive will also require a 10% reduction in waste from food processing and manufacturing. Additionally, the EU is targeting the fast fashion industry through an extended producer responsibility scheme, making textile and footwear companies financially responsible for the collection, sorting, and recycling of their products. These measures address the significant environmental impact of the nearly 60 million tons of food and 12.6 million tons of textiles wasted annually in the bloc.</p>

          <p>The ticket marketplace StubHub is targeting a valuation of up to $9.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering, planning to raise as much as $851 million by selling over 34 million shares. The company intends to price its shares between $22 and $25 each and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB." After postponing previous attempts amid market volatility, StubHub is moving forward as the IPO market shows signs of recovery. The company's latest financial filings show a 10% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, though its net loss also widened. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, several prominent figures in the UK's Labour Party have announced their candidacy for the deputy leader position. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and senior backbencher Dame Emily Thornberry are among the high-profile names entering the contest, alongside former House of Commons leader Lucy Powell. Candidates have a short window to secure the necessary nominations from fellow MPs before the decision goes to a vote by party members, with the winner to be announced in late October. The race highlights different ideological wings of the party, with some candidates signaling a more critical stance toward the current government's direction.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo who was dismissed after just three games into the season. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham three months ago, returns to Premier League management with a reputation for winning trophies, including a historic Europa League victory with Spurs. Forest's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, stated that the hiring reflects the club's ambition to compete at the highest level and challenge for titles. Postecoglou's attacking, high-intensity style contrasts with his predecessor's approach, signaling a significant tactical shift for the team as they prepare to face Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Sam Curran is set to make his return to England's T20 cricket side for the first match of the series against South Africa in Cardiff. This marks his first appearance under head coach Brendon McCullum since November 2024, following a strong performance in The Hundred tournament for the Oval Invincibles. Curran's inclusion addresses the team's need for a seam bowling all-rounder, a role that was noticeably vacant during the recent one-day international series. Opener Phil Salt also returns to the lineup after missing the previous series for paternity leave, as England looks to strengthen its white-ball squad.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals negotiated by the Trump administration, serving both symbolic and practical purposes. High-value, high-profile aircraft purchases allow countries to demonstrate a commitment to reducing their trade surpluses with the U.S., a key goal for the administration. Unlike agricultural or industrial goods, importing planes is often less politically sensitive for partner nations. Furthermore, with a rising global demand for air travel and long production backlogs, these deals align with the airlines' actual needs, making Boeing an iconic and pragmatic centerpiece for international economic agreements.</p>

          <p>Zookeepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, UK, are celebrating what they describe as one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom: a "virgin birth" by a female casque-headed iguana. The iguana gave birth to eight healthy hatchlings despite never having mated with a male. This rare phenomenon, known as parthenogenesis, allows an unfertilized egg to develop into an embryo, creating offspring that are genetic clones of the mother. The zoo's director expressed astonishment at the fertile eggs, calling the event a powerful reminder that life can find a way under the most unexpected circumstances.</p>
