        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer emphasized that the scheme would be reciprocal and would not represent a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door," while Reform UK echoed these sentiments, expressing concern that it could be the beginning of unrestricted EU migration. An agreement in principle is expected at an upcoming summit, but details regarding age eligibility and potential caps on numbers remain unspecified.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Walmart after the retailer warned it would need to raise prices due to tariffs, urging the company to absorb the costs rather than pass them on to consumers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey stated that the company is trying to keep prices low despite facing significant cost increases due to tariffs. Walmart affirmed its commitment to maintaining low prices, but acknowledged the challenges posed by small retail margins. Other companies, including Microsoft, Mattel, and Ford, have also announced or warned of price increases due to tariffs, highlighting the widespread impact of trade policies on businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that China's air power is advancing and maturing, evidenced by the reported deployment and success of the Chinese-made J-10C fighter jet by the Pakistan Air Force during an aerial clash with India. The J-10C, equipped with Chinese PL-15 missiles, allegedly shot down at least two Indian jets, marking the first combat success for Chinese aircraft using domestic systems. This performance signals a doctrinal shift towards ecosystem-centric warfare, prioritizing information dominance and coordination of multiple assets, mirroring strategies pioneered by the United States but tailored to Chinese strengths in mass production and systems integration.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is entering its crucial sales period, with the Memorial Day outdoor sales event expected to drive significant revenue. The company's Q2, encompassing May, June, and July, is typically its highest revenue quarter, driven by gardening and seasonal trends. Despite tariff uncertainty and elevated mortgage rates, Home Depot remains optimistic, with analysts closely monitoring forward guidance provided alongside the company's first-quarter earnings. While housing turnover is a key factor, recent data indicates increased home loan demand, and contractors are anticipating a comeback in larger projects later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a three-eyed creature with a pencil sharpener-like mouth that roamed the sea for prey more than 500 million years ago. The fossilized remains of one Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth," were found in the Burgess Shale of Canadian Rockies. The predator was about the length of an index finger, with three eyes dotting its head and a circular mouth lined with teeth. The discovery of the Mosura revealed that the creature was much more complex than fossils of other radiodonts previously suggested, according to researchers.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's struggles at Wembley Stadium persisted as Manchester City lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace.

City manager Pep Guardiola explained that the decision was based on the players' feelings in the moment. Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested that the pressure of the occasion might have affected Haaland, contrasting his behavior with that of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who would not have relinquished the penalty opportunity.</p>

          <p>After the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, Lando Norris says he is "just not good enough" in qualifying. The Spaniard's showing was his team's best of what has so far been a difficult year and it comes as a result of a major upgrade on the car that has - at least partly - been influenced by their new managing technical partner, Adrian Newey, the design legend who joined in March. However, the 43-year-old emphasised that while he was "happy to be fifth", it was not close to his or the team's ambitions. Piastri spoke about his determination to ensure he kept the lead at the start.</p>
