          <h2>Japan Considers Reusing Fukushima Soil at Government Grounds</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government is exploring the possibility of reusing soil removed from areas surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities. This initiative aims to establish a precedent for soil recycling outside of Fukushima Prefecture, as previous demonstration projects in Tokyo and its vicinity faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry based on prior demonstration projects, would likely be used for flowerbeds and similar purposes in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki district. Japan aims to reduce the overall amount of soil requiring disposal by recycling soil with relatively low radioactivity for public works projects. </p>

          <p>Germany and Nigeria have pledged to enhance their partnership in key areas such as economy, energy, and migration. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized Nigeria's importance as a partner in Africa, highlighting opportunities for economic cooperation, particularly in rare earths. Nigeria, already Germany's second-largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, aims to intensify trade relations and collaborate on renewable energy and labor migration. With Nigeria's population projected to reach 400 million by 2050, the focus is on exporting talent through structured job creation solutions. </p>

          <p>Chinese AI scholar Wang Jian is advocating for increased use of artificial intelligence in space exploration, particularly in Zhejiang Lab's plan to build a constellation of 1,000 satellites. These satellites would process data in orbit, enhancing computing efficiency compared to Earth-based data processing. Wang emphasized the importance of AI in space, envisioning the technology's potential impact over the next several decades. The Three-Body Computing Constellation aims to establish space infrastructure to achieve a computing power of 1,000 petaflops. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to John Clarke, a former EU trade negotiator, the current disagreements between China and the European Union regarding electric vehicles are not "existential." Clarke believes that both sides are interested in working more closely together on trade and the green transition in order to counteract the disturbance brought about by US President Donald Trump. He highlighted areas with strong potential for cooperation, such as energy, space, pandemic preparedness, and, most importantly, the green transition. Clarke emphasized the EU's goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and stated that Chinese environmental technology and goods are essential for a more affordable transition. </p>

          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, and contrasts it with the current trend of politicians and judges remaining in power for too long. He argues that the desire to cling to power is a human trait, amplified by enablers who benefit from a leader's influence. French suggests that a culture obsessed with career success makes it difficult for individuals to step aside, and highlights the importance of valuing family and personal virtues over professional achievements. He praises Justice Souter for prioritizing a life beyond the court and encourages leaders to do their duty and then allow the next generation to take its turn. </p>

          <p>Calley Means, a former lobbyist turned health care entrepreneur, has become a key figure in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. As a top adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Means coordinated a report on chronic disease among children, focusing on environmental toxins and corporate influences. Means, who consulted for companies like Coca-Cola, now calls out what he sees as insidious tactics harming American children. While some scientists agree with the movement's focus on children's health, others criticize what they see as an overly simplified picture of complex causes of chronic disease. </p>

          <p>Juan Soto, the Mets' $765 million slugger, is facing scrutiny despite a decent start to his career with the team. Soto's hustle, or lack thereof, has been criticized, and rumors have circulated about his clubhouse demeanor. While Soto's OPS+ of 134 is above average, it's below his career standard, leading to some anxiety among fans. However, historical data suggests that Soto's performance is likely to improve, and concerns are likely overblown. (not investment advice) </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has identified the genetic mutation that gives orange cats their distinctive color, solving a decades-old mystery. Two studies, published in Current Biology, pinpointed a small piece of missing DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene responsible for the orange mutation. The research involved collecting DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners, who eagerly participated in the study. The findings reveal that the mutation activates the ARHGAP36 gene, which is not normally active in pigment cells, and intersects with the pathway responsible for red hair in humans, but in a different way. </p>
