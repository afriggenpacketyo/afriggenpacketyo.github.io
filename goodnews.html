          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, also known as the "sea moth." The creature, which roamed the seas during the Cambrian period, was about the length of an index finger and had a circular mouth lined with teeth. Researchers believe the Mosura used its body flaps to swim, similar to modern stingrays, sharing the waters with fellow radiodont and early apex predator, the iconic Anomalocaris canadensis. The discovery provides new insights into the diversity of life on Earth prior to the Cambrian explosion.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland, the Manchester City striker, made a surprising decision during the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace by passing on a penalty opportunity. Instead of taking the shot himself, Haaland kissed the ball and handed it over to Omar Marmoush, who ultimately had his attempt saved. Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested that the pressure of the occasion may have affected Haaland's decision. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said that the players decided that Omar was ready to take it.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz criticized President Trump in a law school graduation speech, accusing him of abusing power and violating the rule of law. Walz urged graduates to stand up against abuses of power, citing Trump's immigration policies and questions about due process. He acknowledged his remarks were pointed for a celebratory ceremony but emphasized the importance of addressing the issue head-on.

          <p>Federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently chided the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Legal scholars have praised the courts' support of due process, but expressed concern that such support was necessary in the first place. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the principle of due process in previous decisions.</p>

          <p>John McWhorter, an opinion writer for The New York Times, visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture and praised its abundance, nuance, and inspirational nature. He contrasted the museum's approach with what he sees as an overemphasis on grievance in much historical thinking today. He lauded the museum for its balance between tragedy and joy, and for its representation of the past in a way that helps people surmount the present and create the future.</p>
