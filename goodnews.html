          <h2>Trump Announces Ceasefire Agreement Between Israel and Iran</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 19:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a "Complete and Total" ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, intended to end the conflict that began on June 13th. The ceasefire was set to begin at midnight ET, with a complete end to the "12 DAY WAR" expected 24 hours later. The conflict started with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, resulting in significant casualties on both sides, and prompted retaliatory missile strikes. The U.S. also took military action, striking three sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program, which sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response was fairly limited. The announcement of a ceasefire is aimed at de-escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets made several roster moves, including signing pitcher Dicky Lovelady to a major league contract, which garnered attention from baseball fans. Lovelady, whose first name is Richard, was activated for the game against the Atlanta Braves, and baseball fans reacted on social media. Lovelady was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in 2016 and has also played for the Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay Rays, and Toronto Blue Jays. The Mets have been dealing with numerous injuries to their pitching staff this season, making Lovelady's addition a potentially valuable one.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims Iran Gave "Early Notice" of Counterstrikes on U.S. Base</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" of missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the warning, which he said allowed for the prevention of casualties, suggesting the counterattack was expected and calibrated. Following the strikes, Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, urging both nations to pursue peace and harmony. This move echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. base in Iraq, where advance notice was given, minimizing damage and avoiding escalation.</p>

          <p>Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr., at 39, will face Jake Paul in a boxing match, aiming to revitalize his career while Paul seeks to solidify his boxing legitimacy. Ch√°vez Jr. views the fight as an opportunity to return to prominence and potentially contend for a world championship, dismissing claims of a predetermined outcome. Paul, known for his controversial boxing career, sees the fight as a chance to silence critics and prove his ambition in the sport. Both fighters assert the bout will be legitimate, despite the spectacle surrounding Paul's involvement in boxing, and it will be a test of Ch√°vez Jr.'s legacy against Paul's disruptive rise.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missiles targeting a U.S. base in Qatar, but with no reported casualties or damage. President Trump characterized Iran's response as "very weak" and expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to de-escalate, potentially leading to renewed negotiations. This high-risk maneuver by Trump could yield positive outcomes if it deters further conflict and encourages Iran to engage in earnest negotiations regarding its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Before embarking on missions that can exceed 40 hours, pilots of the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber undergo extensive preparation, including nutritional education. Pilots learn about foods that affect alertness and digestion, critical for long intercontinental flights. Retired Lt. Gen. Steve Basham, a former B-2 pilot, emphasizes the importance of bland, easily digestible meals like turkey sandwiches without cheese. The B-2's success relies on human performance, as the two-person crew must manage mid-air refuelings and maintain alertness during extended operations.</p>

While reserving the right to respond, Trump indicated there are no active plans for the U.S. to retaliate at this time, emphasizing that Iran has "gotten it all out of their 'system'."
