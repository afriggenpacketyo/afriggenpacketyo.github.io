Applications for home purchases dropped 4% for the week but were 18% higher than the same week last year, driven by increased market supply.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that changes to winter fuel payments will be implemented this year, allowing more people to qualify for the allowance. This decision reverses a previous policy that restricted the payment to those on pension credit, which was criticized for negatively impacting Labour's performance in local elections. While the specifics of the changes remain unclear, the government aims to assist pensioners struggling with energy costs during the winter months. Pensions Minister Torsten Bell clarified that the payment will not return to the previous system of universal distribution to all pensioners.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to reduce dependence on Russian gas and oil, the EU has increased its imports of Russian fertilizer since the start of the war in Ukraine. Russia now accounts for 30% of EU fertilizer imports, raising concerns about the EU's vulnerability to coercive actions by Russia. The European Parliament has endorsed a plan to introduce tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing them to 50% by 2028. This move aims to diversify the EU's fertilizer sources and promote the use of organic alternatives, though farmers are concerned about the availability of affordable alternatives. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that a sustained signal in the brain, following a positive or negative experience, plays a crucial role in generating emotions. The research, published in Science, identifies two phases of brain activity: an initial, brief sensory response and a subsequent, lingering signal in circuits involved in emotion. The findings could help explain emotional differences seen in neuropsychiatric conditions. Some researchers, however, argue that the sustained signal may not be specific to emotion and could be involved in other cognitive processes.</p>

          <p>Director Alan Taylor discusses the making of the dragon battle in the fourth episode of "House of the Dragon" Season 2. The sequence involved multiple departments and took over a year to execute, with the goal of making the dragons feel real and palpable. The team studied footage of birds of prey to incorporate realistic movements into the dragon fight. The actors were filmed on a buck atop a motion-controlled base surrounded by blue screens to simulate the dragon-riding scenes.</p>
