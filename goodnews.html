The Japanese government plans to closely monitor the details of the measures to be revealed by the United States. The negotiator also expressed optimism regarding Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp. (not investment advice)</p>

Isaacman expressed gratitude for the experience and acknowledged the complexities of government. Elon Musk commented on X that Isaacman is "competent and good-hearted."</p>

          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has given a favorable initial assessment of the tightened border controls, dismissing concerns about overburdened personnel. Temporary checks were reintroduced at all nine of Germany's land borders in September 2024. The Federal Police has reinforced personnel by almost 1,200 colleagues, bringing the total number of officers deployed at the borders to 13,000 to 14,000. Romann rejected the assumption that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, for border controls.</p>

          <p>As legislative cuts impacting Medicaid and Snap are proposed, organizers suggest learning from past poor people's movements to build power and fight for a new social contract. The welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, led by poor Black women, staged mass marches and demonstrations to challenge racist policies. The Johnnie Tillmon model proposes uniting the poor across differences, operating independently, and building projects of survival. The model emphasizes that those with the least invested in the status quo are strategically positioned to drive change.</p>
