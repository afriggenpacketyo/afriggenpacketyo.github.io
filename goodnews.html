          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. The plan aims to rebuild the utility without requiring taxpayer funding, addressing years of performance issues, including sewage discharges and leaks. Investors have stipulated that the cash injection is contingent on setting achievable performance targets, as they argue the current ones are unrealistic for attracting future investment.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the world's largest storm this year, made landfall in mainland China without causing any fatalities, a stark contrast to previous deadly typhoons in the region. The zero death toll is attributed to extensive preparations, particularly in the tech hub of Shenzhen and throughout Guangdong province. Authorities evacuated over one million people, deployed more than 38,000 rescue personnel, and opened nearly 900 temporary shelters ahead of the storm's arrival. This successful disaster management highlights significant improvements in China's emergency response systems compared to past events, where storms and other natural disasters resulted in numerous deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's State Council has issued new guidelines clarifying the standards for products to be considered "Made in China" in government procurement, a move aimed at reassuring foreign companies. Effective January 1, qualifying goods will receive a 20% price preference, and this policy will apply equally to state-owned, private, and foreign-owned firms operating in the country. To qualify, products must meet a certain threshold for the cost of domestically produced components, with some sectors requiring critical processes to be completed in China. Analysts note that these measures create a more transparent and predictable environment, aligning China's practices more closely with those of the U.S. and E.U.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back, stiff neck, or achy shoulders can often be attributed to improper sleep posture that creates a lack of support overnight. Medical experts advise maintaining a neutral spine alignment, similar to standing posture, by keeping ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line. The article provides specific recommendations for back, side, and stomach sleepers, including choosing the right pillow loft and using smaller pillows to fill gaps under the knees or between the legs. While sleeping on one's stomach is generally discouraged due to neck strain, the guidance aims to help individuals in any position minimize muscle tension and improve sleep quality.</p>

The government also plans to amend its Air Security Act to grant the Bundeswehr more authority to assist police in countering drone threats. Furthermore, Germany is set to acquire its own kamikaze drones for the first time, reflecting a major policy shift influenced by the widespread and effective use of unmanned aircraft in the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has issued a formal apology for the widespread fraud and human rights abuses that occurred within the country's past foreign adoption programs. The apology follows a landmark report from a truth commission which found the government responsible for allowing agencies to falsify records and, in some cases, remove children from their birth families without consent during the 1970s and 1980s. In his statement, President Lee offered a "heartfelt apology" to adoptees and their families, acknowledging the government's failure to prevent the abuses. The apology coincides with South Korea's official implementation of the Hague Adoption Convention, aimed at safeguarding international adoptions.</p>

The primary driver for this optimistic forecast is the increasing rate of institutional adoption, evidenced by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury acquisitions. For Bitcoin to achieve this price target from its current level, it would require a compound annual growth rate of 55%. The article contrasts this bullish outlook with more modest market predictions and notes that such growth would surpass even that of top-performing tech stocks like Nvidia.

Shein stated that France's influential fashion market made it a natural choice for this retail experiment, which is expected to create around 200 jobs and help revitalize city centers.</p>

The neutral country has faced criticism for blocking the re-export of Swiss-made weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, a policy the government proposed easing earlier this year. Pfister warned that in an era of growing threats like cyber attacks and drone incursions, Switzerland must be seen as a reliable partner to ensure its own security.
