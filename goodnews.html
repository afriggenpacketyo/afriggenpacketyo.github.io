          <p>A sweeping US tax and spending bill, dubbed Trump's 'mega-bill,' has moved one step closer to a full vote in the House after overcoming Republican conflict. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term, end taxes on tips, and increase military and border spending. However, the bill faces opposition from both hard-line conservatives and moderates, raising concerns about its potential impact on the national debt. Despite these challenges, House Speaker Mike Johnson expects the bill to advance to a floor vote later in the week.</p>

          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he is 'leaning' toward only one rate cut this year, citing concerns about potential upward pressures on inflation. Bostic emphasized the importance of balancing inflation with worries about a recession. He noted that tariffs have been larger than the central bank initially expected.

          <p>The biggest talking point from the 107th US PGA, aside from Scottie Scheffler's victory, was the controversy surrounding Rory McIlroy's 'non-conforming' driver. Rumors emerged that McIlroy had been forced to switch drivers before the tournament due to his club failing a legality test. The PGA of America issued a statement confirming that testing had been carried out, but did not identify any players or confirm any failed tests. McIlroy remained silent, ignoring reporters after his rounds and finishing in a disappointing share of 47th place, leading to speculation about the validity of his Masters win.</p>
