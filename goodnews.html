          <p>In a recent interview, Jennifer Aniston reflected on the intense tabloid coverage of her 2005 split from ex-husband Brad Pitt, describing it as a "vulnerable time" where the public narrative became like a soap opera for people. She recalled taking the media storm personally, as it coincided with Pitt's widely publicized relationship with Angelina Jolie. Aniston, now 56, acknowledged the difficulty of navigating such a personal crisis under intense public scrutiny but noted that she ultimately had to pick herself up and move forward.</p>

          <p>Forecasters announced the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on Monday, noting it could strengthen into the season's first hurricane later in the week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is currently moving west, with early models projecting it to become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its development marks the fifth named storm of an Atlantic hurricane season predicted to be above-normal.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance, helping the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory over the London Spirit in The Hundred cricket tournament. Baker's initial spell was remarkably restrictive, conceding only four runs from his first 10 balls and troubling seasoned international batters. His crucial dismissal of Ashton Turner later in the match earned him the player of the match award. Team captain Phil Salt praised Baker's performance, comparing his skill to that of England legend James Anderson.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests the global transition to clean energy could face significant shortages of at least 12 key minerals by 2100, raising concerns about a potential "peak mineral" crisis. However, this analysis argues that such fears may be overstated, much like the "peak oil" theory of the past. Rapid technological innovation is already creating substitutes for critical materials like cobalt and silver, and new battery chemistries are reducing reliance on lithium. The article suggests that market forces, government intervention, and continued innovation will likely adapt to shifting mineral needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether gold is a suitable investment for beginners, especially in the current economic climate of rising inflation and market volatility. It advises new investors to consider three key factors: their short-term financial goals, the price volatility of gold, and their need for a portfolio diversifier. While gold can act as a hedge against inflation, its high price and lack of income generation may make it less suitable for those just starting to build savings. The article suggests that a small, strategic allocation could be beneficial for long-term diversification. (not investment advice)</p>
