          <p>The autopen, a machine that automates a person's signature, is at the center of a political debate after Donald Trump alleged that President Biden used one to sign pardons. These devices have been used by presidents throughout U.S. history to sign documents, letters, and legislation. While the use of autopens is not new, it has sparked controversy amid claims of cognitive decline. The Justice Department has previously determined that using an autopen to sign a bill is constitutional, as the president need not physically sign every document to approve it.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for several weeks, prompting evacuations that have since been lifted. Firefighters are actively combating the blazes, while crews are also fighting significant wildfires in Central and Western Canada. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the National Incident Management Organization are managing the fires, which have affected approximately 30,000 acres. Interactive maps are available to show the extent of the damage and the areas affected by the fires, with air quality alerts in effect due to hazardous smoke.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has completed the signing of striker Liam Delap from Ipswich Town for a ¬£30 million fee. The 22-year-old has agreed to a six-year contract with Chelsea, following the activation of a release clause in his Ipswich deal after their relegation from the Premier League. The transfer involves an upfront payment of ¬£20 million, and Ipswich Town has negotiated a sell-on clause as part of the agreement. Chelsea secured Delap despite competition from other clubs, including Manchester United and Newcastle United.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported. The order comes in response to a request from a media coalition, including CBS News. The Justice Department had opposed the release of the records, citing national security concerns and the nature of the filings as discovery materials. The judge found that the public's right to access court records outweighs these concerns. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake.</p>

          <p>A 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, dating back to 1830, is believed to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print. The museum purchased the item at auction and determined it had not been used. The museum considers the item a "luxury souvenir" from a brothel in France and notes the print parodies celibacy and Greek mythology.</p>
