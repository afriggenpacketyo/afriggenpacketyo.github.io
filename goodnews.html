          <p>Verizon has signed a definitive commercial agreement with AST SpaceMobile to provide direct-to-device cellular broadband service from space, set to begin next year. This partnership aims to eliminate coverage gaps across the continental United States by leveraging Verizon's spectrum with AST's satellite network. The announcement, which builds on a previous collaboration, caused a significant surge in AST SpaceMobile's stock price. The service is designed to provide connectivity to standard mobile phones without requiring special hardware, enhancing coverage in remote or underserved areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are promoting qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) as a highly effective, yet underutilized, tax strategy for retirees. This method allows individuals aged 70½ or older to donate up to $108,000 directly from their pretax IRA to a charity, with the amount excluded from their adjusted gross income. This is more advantageous than a standard deduction as it can lower income-related Medicare premiums and help satisfy required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations without increasing the retiree's tax burden, making it a powerful tool for philanthropic giving.

He stated that the focus is on leveraging the existing deal to create opportunities for businesses, while maintaining the current immigration policy, which aims to attract top global talent without creating new specific visa routes for India.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is gradually weakening off the Pacific coast of Mexico but remains a powerful Category 2 storm with sustained winds of 100 mph. While the storm's center is expected to move parallel to the coast of Baja California Sur without making a direct landfall, it is generating large, dangerous swells. These conditions are causing life-threatening surf and rip currents for parts of southwestern Mexico and the Baja peninsula.

          <p>A social media trend known as "locking in" has gained popularity among Gen Z, involving periods of intense, hyper-focused dedication to achieving personal goals related to fitness, finance, or self-improvement. Originating from gaming culture, the trend is seen as a reaction to the constant distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing young people. While some critics view it as a performance of productivity, others see it as a coping mechanism for a generation seeking control and a proactive way to navigate an uncertain future.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Joe Root has dismissed the ongoing commentary about his failure to score a Test century in Australia, stating he is not concerned with the opinions of pundits. Ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, Root emphasized that his focus is on the team's collective success rather than personal milestones. He believes that in the future, the series' outcome will be what is remembered, not the critiques of his individual performance, and expressed confidence in England's different approach and strong bowling attack for the tour.</p>

          <p>High-stakes, indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas have entered a third day in Egypt, with top U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner joining the talks.

A senior Hamas official reported submitting a list of Palestinian prisoners for a potential exchange, and while Israeli officials expressed "cautious optimism," significant gaps reportedly remain between the two sides on key issues.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi's founder and CEO, Lei Jun, has announced that the initial sales of the company's new 17-series smartphones have surpassed expectations, positioning them as a formidable competitor to Apple's iPhone 17.

This early success reinforces Xiaomi's strategy of focusing more on the premium smartphone segment, where it aims to challenge industry leaders like Apple and Huawei with high-end features and competitive pricing.</p>

          <p>In a series of opinion pieces published in the Communist Party's official newspaper, China's economy has been metaphorically described as an "unsinkable economic aircraft carrier." The articles, released ahead of a key policy-setting meeting, are designed to project an image of strength and resilience against both internal and external pressures like trade protectionism. The pieces emphasize that China's long-term planning ensures policy continuity and predictability, contrasting this stability with what it calls the whimsical and self-isolating policies of some Western countries.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, an autistic mathematics professor shares their personal experience to argue that autism is not a tragedy to be cured or eliminated, but rather a form of neurodivergence that brings unique strengths. The author reframes common autistic traits like persistence and attention to detail as assets, particularly in academic and scientific fields, drawing parallels to historical figures like Isaac Newton. The article is a call for inclusion and a rejection of the subtext in some public discussions that suggests the world would be better without autistic people.</p>
