        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are making strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies, potentially replacing chemotherapy for some patients. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in ADC development, with some ADCs already showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. However, challenges remain, including preventing the premature release of toxic payloads and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target. The article discusses the progress and hurdles in developing ADCs, which could account for a significant portion of the cancer market in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes McLaren's team strategy regarding Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, questioning whether McLaren should prioritize Piastri due to his consistent performance. It notes that while Piastri has had a better season, the outright performance of both drivers is closely matched, with Piastri capitalizing on Norris's errors. The article suggests that McLaren is unlikely to prioritize one driver over the other, given their strong position in the championship and the consistent performance of their car.
