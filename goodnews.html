          <p>China has opened the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, in Jiangsu province. The massive 10.3km structure connects the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou, dramatically reducing travel time from over an hour to just 20 minutes. This engineering feat is the first crossing on the river to integrate an expressway, a regular road, and an intercity railway on a single structure. Its innovative design features an asymmetrical lower deck to balance the weight of the different transport modes, showcasing a significant advancement in bridge construction.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index surged to a new record high, reflecting overnight gains on Wall Street fueled by hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut and positive inflation data. A significant driver of the rally was tech investment giant SoftBank Group, whose shares jumped nearly 10%. While the Nikkei led gains in Asia, other regional markets showed mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi advancing while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines. The market movement underscores investor sensitivity to U.S. economic indicators and monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An estimated 250,000 residents in rural West Virginia lack access to safe and reliable drinking water, forcing many to depend on untreated sources like abandoned coal mines. This public health crisis stems from decaying infrastructure that was once maintained by the coal industry but fell into disrepair as the industry declined. The article highlights the daily struggles of residents who have had to accept this reality for decades. Non-profit organizations like DigDeep are now stepping in to build new water systems, offering a source of hope for these underserved Appalachian communities.</p>

Educators are participating in programs, such as those at New York's 9/11 Memorial and Museum, to learn from survivors and first responders. The goal is to create lesson plans that effectively convey the trauma, global impact, and sense of national unity that followed the attacks. Teachers emphasize that it is critical for students to understand this watershed moment in U.S. history and its lasting consequences.</p>

          <h2>Medical Expert Offers Five Science-Backed Tips for Managing Stress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 20:30:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken outlines five practical, science-supported methods for managing stress, noting that while the stress hormone cortisol is often viewed negatively, it is essential for daily function. The key is to maintain balance rather than eliminate it entirely. His advice includes accepting stress as a normal part of life without panicking, using exercise to train the body to handle cortisol spikes, and prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule. He also recommends focusing on self-care through proper nutrition and carving out dedicated time for relaxation and mindfulness.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a lean and practical artificial intelligence strategy that contrasts with the massive capital investment approach seen in the United States. Through its "AI+" initiative and a national AI fund, Beijing is focusing on integrating AI into key sectors of the economy, such as the power grid and industry. This resource-efficient approach aims to leverage existing infrastructure and talent to achieve widespread, practical applications of AI technology. The strategy is designed to adapt to U.S. restrictions on advanced chips by prioritizing usability and consolidation of resources for significant national projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant potential milestone for China's aviation industry, Capital A, the parent company of AirAsia, has confirmed it is in "active discussions" to purchase the C919 passenger jet. If the deal is completed, the Malaysian carrier would become the first foreign airline to operate the Chinese-made aircraft. The C919, manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is a single-aisle jet designed to compete directly with the popular Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 models. This interest reflects growing economic ties and air travel demand between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Following its successful initial public offering, which saw its stock price climb significantly on the first day, CNBC's Jim Cramer believes shares of the online lender Klarna are still a worthwhile purchase. He argued that despite the immediate surge, the company's valuation has not reached an excessive level and its improving fundamentals, including strong growth and shrinking losses, are encouraging. Cramer highlighted Klarna's solid credit quality and automated underwriting standards as positive signs, suggesting the company is well-positioned for future growth even as it remains unprofitable for now.

          <p>In an effort to stimulate housing construction, California lawmakers have introduced a bill to reform Los Angeles's Measure ULA, commonly known as the "mansion tax." The legislation aims to address criticisms that the tax has deterred the development of new apartment buildings and commercial properties by significantly reducing the tax rate for such projects built within the last 15 years. This move is also part of a broader political strategy to undermine a potential statewide ballot measure that threatens to nullify Measure ULA and other local taxes completely.</p>

          <p>Traditional television cooking shows are facing a steep decline, with commissions for new food-related programs having dropped by 44% in the past year. This downturn is occurring as audiences shift their attention to food content on social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Online creators offer a sense of authenticity and can respond to culinary trends almost instantly, a nimbleness that the structured and regulated world of broadcast television cannot match. The trend reflects a wider cultural shift in media consumption, where viewers increasingly favor the raw, direct engagement of influencers over polished television productions.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," host Jim Cramer reflected on the evolution of market sentiment, noting that the optimism of the 1990s feels similar to today's environment. He stated that after the dotcom bubble burst, many investors became risk-averse and favored index funds, but now there is a renewed excitement for the potential rewards of owning individual stocks. Cramer believes the show played a key role in democratizing financial information and sees the current interest in high-performing single stocks like Oracle and Nvidia as a welcome return to form.

Speaking to a Senate subcommittee, Michael Kratsios stated that the U.S. competitive gap has closed significantly and is in danger of being lost. He advocated for exporting cohesive "AI tech stacks"—which integrate chips, algorithms, and applications—to allied nations. This approach is intended to prevent China from capturing global market share and to strengthen the U.S. ecosystem by coordinating with allies on export controls and supply chain security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying the remarkable diversity of Australia's peacock spiders, which comprise over 100 different species, to unlock the secrets of evolution. Scientists believe the key may be found in the spiders' "dark DNA"—the vast sections of the genetic code that do not contain genes. These spiders have three times more dark DNA than humans, and it is hypothesized that this material enables them to adapt and evolve into new species with unique colors and mating dances very rapidly. This research could provide broader insights into how variation arises across the natural world.</p>
