          <p>A Manhattan woman successfully found a 2.3-carat white diamond at Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park after a dedicated three-week search for the perfect stone for her engagement ring. Micherre Fox, 31, had long planned to find her own diamond, viewing the effort as symbolic of the hard work required in a marriage. On her final day at the park, she spotted the gem, which was later confirmed by park staff, making it the third-largest diamond found there this year. She has named the stone the "Fox-Ballou Diamond" in honor of her and her partner.</p>

Companies from United Airlines and Walmart to the NHL and Google have integrated orange themes into their social media and search results, seeking to align their brands with the singer's immense economic influence.

Capt. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman for the British Indian Army in the Burma campaign, shared his extraordinary journey from fighting against fascism to witnessing the devastation in Hiroshima. Reflecting on his experiences, he expressed a profound disillusionment with conflict, stating that humanity seems to have learned nothing from the past, as evidenced by current global wars.</p>

          <p>Iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street, years after its physical stores closed following the collapse of its parent company, Arcadia, in 2020. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, is set to open new standalone stores and will host its first catwalk show in seven years at London's Trafalgar Square. While nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials and Gen-Z, industry experts caution that its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants in a challenging retail environment.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a dramatic Premier League opener at Anfield, but the victory highlighted significant defensive vulnerabilities for the reigning champions. New £70 million striker Hugo Ekitike was a standout performer, scoring one goal and assisting another, making a strong case for his place amid rumors of another major signing. However, Liverpool's defense appeared porous, allowing Bournemouth to equalize at 2-2 with a notable goal from Antoine Semenyo, who ran unchallenged for 50 yards. The chaotic match showcased both the team's potent attack and the urgent need to address its defensive weaknesses.</p>

This revival is clearing a backlog of high-value startups waiting to go public, with Wall Street anticipating a continued wave of offerings as companies look to capitalize on the favorable market conditions.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to remove its newly appointed emergency police chief for Washington, D.C., and rewrite a directive that would have ended the city's "sanctuary" policies. The decision came after the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department was illegal. Following a court hearing, the DOJ agreed that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in charge, scaling back the administration's sweeping orders and averting an immediate constitutional clash over local governance and immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck with a minimalist design, aiming for a price point around half the national average for new vehicles. The company's strategy focuses on a simple, barebones base model that owners can customize with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. While the initial advertised price relied on federal tax credits that are being rolled back, Slate remains confident in its appeal, though it faces competition from other sub-$30,000 vehicles that offer more standard features.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to reduce the scope of the federal government's takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the pact, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain control of the department, rather than a federally appointed administrator. The agreement was reached after D.C. filed a lawsuit and sought an emergency restraining order against what it called a "hostile takeover." This de-escalation follows a federal judge signaling she was prepared to block the administration's move, resolving a tense standoff over local autonomy.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the Trump administration's federalization of the Washington D.C.

This legislative action comes alongside a legal agreement to scale back the federal intervention, reflecting a multi-pronged effort by local and federal officials to restore D.C.'s authority over its own law enforcement.</p>
