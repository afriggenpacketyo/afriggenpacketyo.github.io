          <p>Kate, the Princess of Wales, was among numerous celebrities and tennis greats attending the 2025 Wimbledon women's final on Centre Court. In her first appearance at the tournament since her cancer recovery, she watched Iga Swiatek defeat Amanda Anisimova. Following the swift match, the Princess, who is the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, presented the championship trophy to Swiatek. The event marked a significant public appearance for the Princess of Wales, drawing considerable media and public attention alongside the high-profile tennis match.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon title in a decisive victory over American Amanda Anisimova, winning 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old demonstrated remarkable composure, capitalizing on her opponent's nervousness and becoming the first woman since 1911 to win a Wimbledon final with a "double bagel." This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title, a feat she described as surreal given her previous successes were on different court surfaces. Anisimova, visibly emotional, acknowledged her struggles during the match but expressed pride in her overall tournament performance.</p>

          <p>Palm Beach County commissioners have unanimously approved a measure to rename a portion of Southern Boulevard as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The roadway is a key route leading to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and is frequently used by his motorcade. This move places Trump alongside other former presidents, including George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama, who also have roadways named after them in Palm Beach County. The proposal must still be approved by the municipalities of West Palm Beach and Palm Beach before the change becomes official and markers can be erected.</p>

          <p>England hooker Jamie George has been called up to the British and Irish Lions squad as a replacement ahead of the first Test against Australia. The move comes after fellow hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie suffered a suspected concussion during a warm-up match, making him a doubt for the crucial game in Brisbane. George, a two-time Lions tourist, was preparing to co-captain England in Argentina but will now join the Lions squad. England's head coach Steve Borthwick expressed his delight for George's selection, while also noting the opportunity it presents for other players to step up.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine distribution and weapons smuggling. Macias, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of extreme gang violence across Ecuador. During a virtual court hearing, he affirmed his acceptance of the extradition, which will make him the first Ecuadorian extradited under a new law. His capture and pending transfer are seen as a major victory for President Daniel Noboa's aggressive campaign against criminal gangs.</p>

While NASA's Artemis program officially targets an earlier 2027 landing, it faces significant technical hurdles, such as the need for in-orbit refueling.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience identifies four common issues that can quietly damage intimacy in relationships: phone overuse, unresolved feelings about an ex, a persistent negativity bias, and unmanaged stress. The article explains that even brief glances at a phone can break emotional connection, while lingering attachments to past partners leave no room for new ones. To combat these blockers, the therapist advises setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships to reclaim energy, challenging negative thought patterns, and openly communicating with a partner about stress responses and needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a negotiation expert, securing a salary increase is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and typically requires a process spanning several weeks. The expert advises initiating conversations during mid-year check-ins rather than annual reviews, as budgets are often set by then. The first meeting's goal should be to open a dialogue and present your case, not to get an immediate agreement. It is crucial to be patient, follow up professionally, and solidify a time for a second discussion to ensure accountability and keep the process moving forward toward a successful outcome.</p>
