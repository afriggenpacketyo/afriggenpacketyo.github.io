          <p>Two winning tickets, one each sold in Missouri and Texas, have claimed the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, marking the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. This significant win follows over three months without a jackpot winner, ending a 42-drawing streak that tied the game's record for consecutive drawings without a top prize. The lucky ticketholders now face the choice between a lump sum cash payment estimated at $410.3 million or an annuity option of $893.5 million spread out over 30 annual payments, increasing by 5% each year. This outcome represents a rare and life-changing event for the recipients, given the astronomical odds of winning the top prize, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

The rushing attack also excelled, gaining 309 yards, the most of the Lincoln Riley era, though the defense did allow Georgia Southern to move the ball at times. This decisive win, despite a sloppy start, demonstrated USC's offensive prowess and provided a cathartic moment for fans, offering plenty to celebrate in the wake of another seamless performance.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, generate a strong force. This force can propel small jumpers 1.5 meters into the air, and by controlling the light flow, the researchers can also enable these materials to swim. Published in the journal Science, this study demonstrates that cavitation, the formation and violent collapse of vapor bubbles, can serve as an efficient and controllable launching mechanism for micro-robots.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her second consecutive US Open title, defeating home favorite Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in a hard-fought final. This victory marks Sabalenka's first Grand Slam trophy of the year, overcoming previous defeats in the Australian and French Open finals. Despite a moment of tension when she failed to serve out the match, Sabalenka regained composure to dominate the tie-break, claiming her fourth Grand Slam singles title. The Belarusian's performance demonstrated improved emotional control, a key factor after earlier season struggles, while Anisimova was left in tears after her second major final loss.</p>

          <h2>US Schools Implement Locked Pouches to Enforce Cellphone Bans in Classrooms</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states are adopting locked magnetic pouches, like those from Yondr, to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, affecting at least 2.5 million students. The initiative aims to reduce distractions and foster better in-class engagement, a sentiment echoed by educators like Dr. Sandy Hattar, who observed students were "distracted" by their devices. While some students welcome the change, others are devising ways to bypass the system, highlighting the ongoing challenge of integrating such policies. The cost of these pouches, around $25-30 per student, has also sparked debate over budget allocation, but proponents believe it creates opportunities for students to experience life outside a "fully digital realm."</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was showered with special baseball treats after a viral incident where an adult woman took a home run ball from him during a game. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, whose father initially secured it for him, only for a woman to confront them, claiming the ball was hers. The man, identified as the boy's father, then returned the ball to the woman. Following the widely shared dispute, a Marlins staffer gave the boy a gift bag of team merchandise, and he later met Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who gifted him an autographed baseball bat, providing a heartwarming resolution to the event.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to broaden its political footprint and shed its image as a "one-man-band" dominated by leader Nigel Farage, by promoting new candidates and recruits. The party's recent conference showcased several hopefuls, including Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives disillusioned with their old party. Reform UK aims to significantly increase its representation in councils and parliaments, with national opinion polls suggesting this ambition is not unrealistic. The party is also enhancing its candidate vetting system to avoid past scandals, as it prepares to contest various elections, including the London mayoral race and next year's general election.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who served in dangerous front-line military roles. She co-founded Sisters in Service, a community interest company that provides support and connection for female military veterans working in healthcare, recognizing the unique challenges they face due to misconceptions about women's military experiences. Dr. Bennett highlights that women often deploy alongside male counterparts and perform critical, dangerous tasks, but frequently feel isolated after leaving service as their journeys are misunderstood. The group aims to create a "cathartic" community where female veterans can share experiences and overcome barriers to seeking help.</p>
