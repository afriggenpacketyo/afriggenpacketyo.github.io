          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped, subject to quotas. Agreement on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs. The UK government said it had "agreed to work on a digital trade deal", however, there was no change to the UK's 2% digital services tax in this deal, which the US government said it was "disappointed" about.</p>

          <p>Shoji Nishida, a hawkish lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has said he will "correct and delete" his controversial remarks that exhibits at a war memorial in Okinawa rewrote the history of the Battle of Okinawa.

          <p>Ahead of Mother's Day, the White House is considering policies to boost the U.S. birth rate, including a baby bonus, but evidence suggests such bonuses have mixed results. Paid parental leave and expanded public child care are more effective in increasing birth rates and improving maternal health. A renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a simple first step, as it allows some parents to stay home with their children and subsidize child care for those who work, drastically cutting the child poverty rate. Investing in mothers from pregnancy through childbirth and across the years of raising children is what will make a real difference.</p>

          <p>The need to rebuild after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires is driving the adoption of innovative construction methods like 3D printing, container-based construction, panelized construction, and modular construction in Los Angeles. These methods offer faster, cheaper, and more reliable alternatives to traditional wood framing, which has remained largely unchanged for over a century. Prefabrication, in particular, is gaining traction as a way to quickly rebuild homes and temporary structures, addressing the region's housing shortage and affordability crisis.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neuroscientist argues against the simple idea of instinct, saying the term is confusing and unhelpful, and that the word "species-typical" is better. Animal behavior is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including genetics, environment, and learning, and he believes that all those factors should be taken into account. The question of whether animals have awareness of their actions is also explored, suggesting that many behaviors are habitual and procedural, similar to human habits like brushing teeth.</p>
