          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations. The agreement would reportedly involve selling the business to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the U.S. while licensing algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, statements from Chinese state media and ByteDance were less definitive, highlighting ongoing negotiations and the critical issue of who will control the powerful content algorithm. The leaders also plan to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea to discuss trade and other issues.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the system to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but anticipate it will remain over open waters for the next several days. The storm's current projected track carries it north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it continues to intensify over the ocean.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in Nanning, China, is highlighting a strategic shift as Chinese companies increasingly target Southeast Asian markets to offset slowing demand from Europe and the United States. Many exporters see the region's rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base as a significant opportunity for expansion. Facing market saturation in the West and geopolitical instability elsewhere, businesses are using the event as a gateway to connect with new buyers. This pivot reflects a broader trend of Chinese firms adapting their global strategies to find new avenues for growth and diversify their overseas presence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing improper and politically charged language in the complaint. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page filing was excessively long and functioned more as a political rally speech than a serious legal document. The judge did not rule on the merits of the case but gave Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more professional and concise complaint. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to undermine his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>Sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II that will be the centerpiece of her national memorial in London's St James's Park. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed his aim to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of Britain's longest-reigning monarch. The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will feature a new bridge and gardens, is set to be revealed in 2026. Jennings plans to consult with the Royal Family and gauge public sentiment to create a fitting tribute to the widely admired queen.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multi-billion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia is being hailed as a significant boost for the UK economy. During President Trump's state visit, Microsoft announced a £22 billion investment, while Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang declared the UK will be an "AI superpower." This enthusiasm from Silicon Valley contrasts with a more pessimistic domestic mood. The investments are seen as a result of the UK government's efforts to align with the U.S. on a pro-growth, innovation-focused tech policy, potentially positioning the country as a key global laboratory for artificial intelligence development.</p>

He emphasized that he is very different from the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed, a role he says has been defining for his career. The success of the show, which concluded in 2022, allowed him the freedom to pursue diverse projects, including his Oscar-winning performance in "Oppenheimer."</p>

In a competitive scene where Latinx comics often struggle for stage time, the show allows them to joke about the immigrant experience and other relatable topics.
