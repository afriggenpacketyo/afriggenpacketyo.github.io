          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, has called on Japanese lawmakers to abolish the death penalty, despite strong public support for it in Japan.

He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and poses the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj emphasizes the need for leadership on this issue and believes that increased public understanding will lead to greater appreciation for arguments against capital punishment.</p>
