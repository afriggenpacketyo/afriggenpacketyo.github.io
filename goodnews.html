        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their international presence to meet the demands of Chinese companies expanding abroad. This global push is encouraged by Beijing and driven by a preference among Chinese businesses for legal support from their compatriots. While they are successfully serving existing clients, attracting new, non-Chinese clients is proving to be a challenge amidst current geopolitical tensions. The number of overseas Chinese legal offices has grown by 70% since 2018, marking a pivotal moment for the country's legal services industry as it adapts to a changing global landscape.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an emergency order temporarily stopping the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests across seven California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on their race and denying detainees access to legal counsel. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims that agents were violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. This order also requires that a Los Angeles immigration facility grant attorneys access to their clients seven days a week.</p>

          <p>As the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, is set to expire in China next year, dozens of local firms are developing rival treatments. Currently, around 60 such drugs are in clinical trials, positioning China to become a major player in the global market for GLP-1 agonists. This surge in competition is expected to significantly lower the cost of these popular but expensive treatments, making them more accessible to patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers in China will soon compete for market share, driving prices down.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement due to rising tariffs, the Port of Long Beach has initiated a major $365-million expansion project. The plan involves extending a quay to accommodate larger ships and is expected to increase cargo-handling capacity by 50%. Officials expressed confidence in the port's long-term growth, citing the need to prepare for bigger vessels and strengthen the American supply chain. This forward-looking investment proceeds even as both the Port of Long Beach and the nearby Port of Los Angeles have reported significant drops in container processing and exports in recent months.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to multiple charges, including drug conspiracy and running a continuing criminal enterprise. Prosecutors stated that Guzman Lopez, known as "El Raton," admitted to his role in leading the Sinaloa Cartel after his father's extradition and conviction. As part of his plea agreement, he has pledged to cooperate fully with authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence and will forfeit $80 million in assets. This guilty plea is being hailed as a significant victory in the US effort against transnational criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Lord Huron's 2015 song "The Night We Met" has become an unlikely global hit, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify a decade after its quiet release. The track's popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and has since maintained a remarkable slow-burning success, amplified by its widespread use on TikTok. The song's annual streams have consistently grown, outperforming major 2024 releases from top artists like Beyoncé and Dua Lipa. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes its lasting appeal to its relatable, wistful theme of reflecting on a past relationship.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically struggled on grass but has found formidable form during this tournament. Anisimova, a former prodigy now fulfilling her potential after a break for mental health, enters her first Wimbledon final as an underdog with an aggressive, free-swinging style. The outcome will likely depend on which player better handles the immense pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience clashing with Anisimova's nothing-to-lose mentality.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine of putting "Australia first" as he navigates the complex relationship between the United States and China. In a recent speech, he invoked wartime leader John Curtin, who turned to the US for an alliance but insisted on Australia acting in its own strategic interests. This recalibration comes as Albanese's government faces domestic pressure over the Aukus security pact and defense spending. While affirming the US alliance, the doctrine signals a determination for Australia to shape its own future in an increasingly uncertain Asia-Pacific region.</p>

For 14 years, Viraj was unable to communicate, leading many to assume he was severely mentally disabled. His single father, Sumit, discovered Viraj could type with his right thumb, which opened a floodgate of communication and revealed his son's profound intelligence. In less than three years, Viraj advanced from basic math to calculus, scored a 35 on the ACT, and graduated high school. He hopes his story will inspire support for the entire non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleges the company uses manipulative and addictive design features that exploit children and teens. The state's attorney general argued that TikTok is intentionally designed to keep young users engaged for longer periods, exposing them to more ads and prompting purchases. The judge ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, noting they focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than user-generated content. TikTok maintains the lawsuit's claims are outdated and that it provides robust safety protections for teens.</p>
