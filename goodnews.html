          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghan nationals. The administration had planned to terminate the program, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan have improved, but the court's ruling provides a one-week pause while it considers the legal merits of the case further. Advocacy groups praised the decision, stating that TPS is a vital lifeline for Afghans who fled Taliban persecution or supported U.S. missions and would face grave danger if returned. The White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, reaffirming its commitment to ending the program.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is calling on the financial industry to change its "negative" narrative surrounding public investment in stocks and shares to help stimulate economic growth. In a major speech, she argued that the system has focused too much on risks without properly highlighting the benefits, preventing savers from fully participating in the country's economic success. The government is now working with financial regulators to develop new, targeted support to help consumers make more informed investment decisions. This push aims to encourage shifting some of the £300 billion currently held in cash savings accounts into UK companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite weighing over 54 pounds that is expected to sell for between $2 million and $4 million. The rare rock, designated NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles through space before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Such meteorites are exceptionally rare, providing scientists with invaluable data to help unlock the secrets of the red planet's geology and history.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced it will expand production of popular gasoline-powered vehicles, shifting manufacturing of the Cadillac Escalade SUV and adding production of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. The facility was previously expected to be retooled exclusively for electric vehicles, but this move signals GM's strategy to meet continued strong customer demand for its traditional internal combustion engine models. The decision, set to take effect in early 2027, builds on a $4 billion investment in U.S. facilities and reflects a flexible, market-driven approach to the ongoing EV transition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Indonesia, stating he has agreed to lower threatened U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32% to 19% in exchange for "full access" for American firms. The deal reportedly includes commitments from Indonesia to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. This agreement is the latest to emerge after the White House issued widespread tariff threats to numerous countries earlier this year. However, as of the announcement, the specific terms of the deal had not been immediately confirmed by Indonesian officials.</p>

This development follows extensive lobbying efforts by the chip industry, including competitor Nvidia, which also expects to resume its own shipments to the major market. The move comes after chipmakers had previously warned of significant revenue losses due to the restrictive trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The outcome is seen as another instance of the Trump administration dropping crypto-related enforcement actions that were initiated under the previous administration.
