        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that medical guidance issued since 2015 recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies in children. This advice reversed previous recommendations to delay feeding allergenic foods. Research analyzing pediatric health records found that peanut allergies in young children declined by over 40% after the guidelines were fully expanded in 2017. While this marks a significant public health success, experts note that overall food allergies are still on the rise and continued education is needed.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, is reportedly planning to order an additional 15 F-35 fighter jets from the American manufacturer Lockheed Martin, on top of the 35 already requested. This move is part of Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget in response to increased security threats in Europe, particularly from Russia. The advanced aircraft are intended to replace the country's aging Tornado fleet and are capable of carrying U.S. nuclear weapons stored in Germany. The additional purchase is estimated to cost around €2.5 billion, reflecting a major shift in Germany's defense posture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called V-levels for students aged 16 and over, aiming to replace Level 3 BTECs and simplify the post-GCSE educational landscape. The proposal is part of a broader white paper on skills and education designed to create clearer pathways for students not pursuing traditional A-levels. Additionally, ministers plan to create a new "stepping stone" qualification to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting GCSEs in maths and English. Critics, however, have raised concerns that V-levels may not adequately fill the gap left by the established BTEC courses.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay demonstrated remarkable tactical flexibility by leading his team to a 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars without his star receiver, Puka Nacua. McVay abandoned his usual three-receiver formation, instead heavily utilizing a three-tight-end set ('13 personnel'), a formation the Rams had barely used all season. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw five touchdowns, three of which came from this new offensive scheme. This strategic pivot highlights McVay's ability to adapt his offensive game plan to compensate for key player absences, proving his reputation as a premier offensive innovator.</p>

          <p>Akeso, a Chinese biotech company, presented promising trial data for its cancer drug, ivonescimab, which combines two proven cancer-fighting strategies. The data, presented at a major European oncology symposium, showed the drug's effectiveness and lower toxicity, with analysts noting it could be two to three years ahead of competitors. Despite the positive scientific news, Akeso's Hong Kong-listed shares experienced volatility, initially rising before closing down amid a broader sell-off of Chinese biotech stocks. The drug aims to compete with established treatments in the lucrative oncology market.</p>

          <p>Following the release of eight previously unseen short stories by Harper Lee, a surviving relative has suggested that other major unpublished works might still be discovered among her papers. Dr. Edwin Conner, Lee's nephew, specifically mentioned two potential manuscripts: a prequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird' titled 'The Long Goodbye' and a true-crime novel called 'The Reverend.' The existence and completeness of these works remain a mystery even to the family. Dr. Conner believes Lee would have been delighted by the publication of her early stories, which she had originally intended to publish in the 1950s.</p>

          <p>A new collection of recently discovered short stories by Harper Lee, written before her masterpiece 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' is set to be published, offering a glimpse into her creative evolution. Lee's relatives state that the stories, found in one of her New York apartments after her death, show a "brilliant writer in the making." Some of the pieces contain early versions of characters and settings that would later appear in her famous novel, including the narrator Jean Louise Finch. The family believes Lee would be pleased with the publication, as she had originally sought to have them published in the 1950s.</p>

          <p>Early sales data from Counterpoint Research indicates that Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup is outselling the previous generation by 14% in the key markets of the United States and China. The standard iPhone 17 model is reportedly seeing particularly strong demand, attributed to significant upgrades including an improved display, more storage, and the new A19 chip. In China, sales of the base model have nearly doubled compared to the iPhone 16's initial launch period. The high-end iPhone 17 Pro Max is also experiencing robust sales, especially in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>The historic Rugby League Ashes series between England and Australia is scheduled to resume for the first time since 2003, with the first test match to be held at Wembley Stadium. The article reflects on Great Britain's memorable 1994 victory over the Kangaroos at the same venue, featuring a classic try by Jonathan Davies. That victory, achieved with only 12 men for most of the match, serves as an inspiration for the current England squad. While Australia enters as the favorite and reigning World Cup holder, the return of the Ashes is seen as a vital moment for building respect for the international game.</p>

          <p>While larger EU economies like Germany and France face stagnation, Poland has maintained robust economic growth, with a GDP increase of nearly 3% in 2024 and similar projections for the coming year. Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland's economy has doubled in size, driven by strong domestic consumption, a well-educated workforce, and effective use of EU infrastructure funds. Despite political divisions and potential fiscal challenges from increased defense and welfare spending, analysts view Poland as a model of successful EU integration and a key driver of economic dynamism in the region.

          <p>A couple in Pembrokeshire, Wales, who built a £150,000 eco-home must adhere to strict environmental standards for five years or face having their house demolished. The home was constructed under Wales' unique One Planet Development policy, which allows building on land not typically granted planning permission if residents can prove a minimal carbon footprint. This includes generating their own energy and water, growing a significant portion of their food, and limiting their consumption. The policy scrutinizes every aspect of their lifestyle, and failure to meet the sustainability targets will result in eviction and removal of the structure.</p>

          <p>Using a novel camera with nanometer resolution and millisecond imaging speed, scientists in China have successfully captured the dynamic process of how neurons communicate. Their research, published in the journal 'Science,' visually details the "kiss-shrink-run" mechanism of synaptic vesicles, the tiny structures that transmit signals between brain cells. This technological achievement has provided direct evidence to help resolve a half-century-long scientific debate about the precise mechanics of neurotransmission. The breakthrough offers a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes that govern brain function.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have identified a specific version of a DNA repair protein as a key factor behind the exceptional longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats. These rodents can live up to 37 years, an extraordinary lifespan for a mammal of their size. The study, published in the journal 'Science,' found that this protein, which is also present in humans, is particularly active in the mole-rats, contributing to their robust health. This discovery could provide a new molecular basis for developing anti-aging therapies aimed at improving human health and lifespan.</p>
