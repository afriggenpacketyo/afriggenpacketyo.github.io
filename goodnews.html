          <h2>Body Fat Percentage a Better Predictor of Health Risks Than BMI, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 05:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida suggests that body fat percentage is a far more accurate predictor of mortality risk than the commonly used Body Mass Index (BMI). Researchers found that individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die over a 15-year period than those with healthy levels. The study criticizes BMI as "deeply flawed" because it cannot distinguish between muscle and fat mass. Experts believe it is time to adopt more accurate, accessible alternatives like bioelectrical impedance analysis as a standard health metric.</p>

          <p>At a Social Democratic Party congress, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a self-critical farewell speech, defending his government's policies while warning against illusions about Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. The event also highlighted other pressing issues, with the UN Refugee Agency head expressing concern over Germany's suspension of its refugee resettlement program. This suspension, following a recent change in government, has paused Germany's commitment to accept 13,000 vulnerable refugees, signaling a shift in the country's humanitarian policy.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit low-key, return to boxing with a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon. After three defeats in his previous four fights, this was Wilder's first win since October 2022 and marked what he calls a "new beginning." The 39-year-old stated he has been working with a sports psychologist to repair himself emotionally and rekindle his love for the sport. While the dominant performance was not as explosive as his past victories, it puts the "Bronze Bomber" back in the win column.</p>

          <p>A top economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China has a "comparative advantage" in the global stablecoin race due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay. The economist, Peng Wensheng, notes that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, offering a 1:1 peg with the fiat currency and operating under a well-established regulatory framework. This perspective suggests that China's existing digital payment infrastructure provides a strong foundation for its potential role in the evolving landscape of digital currencies.

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move aimed at protecting the endangered fish. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel. This measure, set to take effect in 2027 if adopted, faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer of eel. The initiative reflects growing global concern over the sustainability of eel populations and aims to curb illegal and unregulated trade that threatens their survival.</p>

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a minimally invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. In the trial, a paralyzed patient successfully regained some limb movement after surgeons inserted a stent electrode into an intracranial blood vessel. This technique, which avoids direct brain surgery, significantly reduces risk and recovery time compared to methods used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink. The breakthrough represents a major advancement in neurotechnology, offering new hope for patients with paralysis.</p>
