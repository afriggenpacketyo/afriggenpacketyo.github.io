          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is exploring the integration of artificial intelligence into its weather forecasting system to improve prediction accuracy. The agency plans to combine AI predictions, derived from historical weather data and deep learning, with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system will analyze extensive data to forecast temperatures and rainfall, potentially improving typhoon path predictions. While AI will refine simulation outputs, experienced forecasters will maintain oversight and issue final weather reports and disaster alerts, ensuring human expertise remains central to the forecasting process.</p>

          <p>Fujii Shuzo, a sake brewery in southwestern Japan with a history spanning over 150 years, has initiated a seminar for foreign sommeliers focusing on traditional sake-making techniques, recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. The five-day seminar, organized by the Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to broaden the awareness and appreciation of sake beyond Japan. Toru Fujii, the brewery's head, expressed concern about the shrinking domestic market and hopes that opening up to international participants will boost exports to Europe. Japan's domestic sake shipping volume has decreased significantly since its peak in 1973, but growing international popularity has led to recent export increases.</p>
