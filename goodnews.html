          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that aligned with economists' expectations. This decision comes as India faces potential tariff increases from the United States, creating uncertainty for external demand. While noting that global geopolitical tensions have somewhat eased, the RBI maintained its GDP growth forecast for the fiscal year at 6.5%. The bank also revised its inflation forecast downward, which some analysts believe could leave room for a future rate cut later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The result leaves the Mexican club Tigres on the verge of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other results.

Muncy went four-for-five with four RBIs, including two home runs, providing a much-needed spark to the team's recently struggling offense. His performance was a significant boost for the Dodgers, who had experienced a major slump in scoring during the 25 games he missed. The game also saw strong offensive contributions from Teoscar Hernández and a resurgent Mookie Betts, signaling a potential turnaround for the lineup.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have reached a nonbinding agreement that outlines a significant media partnership. Under the proposed terms, ESPN would acquire the NFL Network, NFL Fantasy, and distribution rights for the RedZone channel. In return, the NFL would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a move that would transform the league from a media licensee to a platform partner. This deal is expected to bolster ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service by adding valuable NFL content. The final agreement is still subject to negotiation and approval by NFL owners and regulators.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying efforts to build its Guo Wang satellite internet network, launching three batches of satellites in a single week to challenge SpaceX's Starlink. However, a shortage of state-owned rockets is creating a bottleneck, signaling a potential conflict between national priorities and the ambitions of other projects. This has forced other Chinese satellite ventures, such as Qianfan, to seek launches from private rocket companies to meet their own aggressive deployment schedules. The situation highlights the immense logistical challenges China faces in its space race ambitions.</p>

The article highlights the work of "successors," including a 12-year-old boy fluent in English, who share the harrowing first-person accounts of the "hibakusha" with tourists and younger generations. These efforts are seen as crucial for conveying the reality of nuclear war and spreading a message of peace.

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of its medium-security prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, was originally built as a luxury hotel and resort in the 1920s. The closure has prompted discussions in the local community about the economic impact and the potential for the historic property to be restored and repurposed.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists regarding whether to set official targets for household consumption in the nation's upcoming five-year plan. Proponents argue that establishing a benchmark for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is essential for boosting domestic demand from its currently low levels. However, other influential thinkers are skeptical, questioning whether such a metric is a practical or effective policy goal for the government to pursue as it plans its long-term economic strategy.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who was sidelined early in the season with a shoulder injury, is showing encouraging signs of a turnaround. He has progressed in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and a new two-seam fastball added to his repertoire. After an underwhelming start to his MLB career, the team is hopeful that a healthy Sasaki can become a valuable asset for their postseason push. He could potentially return to the active roster near the end of August, either as a starter or a high-leverage reliever.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating more than $4 billion from a FEMA disaster mitigation program. The ruling sides with 20 states that sued after the administration terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which funds projects to protect against natural disasters. The judge determined that redirecting the congressionally approved funds could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and other vulnerable communities awaiting critical infrastructure support.</p>
