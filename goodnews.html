          <p>British Petroleum reported second-quarter profits of $2.35 billion, significantly surpassing analyst forecasts amid volatile energy prices. The strong performance is attributed to record operating efficiency and the startup of five new major projects. CEO Murray Auchincloss also highlighted significant exploration success, including the Bumerangue discovery off the coast of Brazil, which is the company's largest oil and gas find in 25 years. These results are part of an effort to rebuild investor confidence after a period of underperformance.</p>

Despite the drop, the result still exceeded analyst expectations, and the company projects a significant increase in oil demand for the second half of 2025. CEO Amin Nasser expressed confidence in strong market fundamentals, even as the company's dividend policy and rising debt remain key points of focus for investors. The company's income is expected to be boosted as OPEC+ partners complete the unwinding of voluntary production cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Key strategies discussed include planning transfers in blocks of fixtures, balancing premium players, and quickly rectifying mistakes. Experts advise patience, such as rolling transfers to make significant team changes without penalty, and making moves late in the week after gathering all available information. The article also highlights the value of the 'eye test' from watching matches, rather than relying solely on statistics, to identify promising players for your fantasy team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis suggests England's chances of winning the upcoming Ashes series in Australia depend almost entirely on captain Ben Stokes. The article highlights England's vulnerability without its all-rounder, noting that no current squad members have won a Test in Australia. Stokes' leadership, batting, and bowling are deemed crucial for a team that has lost 13 of its last 15 Tests down under. If Stokes can overcome recent injuries and lead his team to victory, it would be considered one of the greatest achievements of his career.</p>

          <p>World nations are meeting in Geneva for another round of negotiations aimed at creating a legally binding global treaty to address the plastic pollution crisis. With plastic production soaring and an estimated 200 trillion plastic pieces in the oceans, the talks seek to establish rules on production, chemical use, and recycling. Key disagreements persist, with nearly 100 countries advocating for limits on plastic production, while oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia push to focus on recycling instead. The previous deadline for a treaty passed without an agreement, increasing pressure to find a resolution.</p>

          <h2>New Chinese KJ-3000 Early Warning Aircraft Spotted in Prototype Stage</h2>

          <p>Recent social media footage has revealed what appears to be a prototype of China's next-generation airborne early warning and control aircraft, the KJ-3000. The plane is based on a modified Y-20B transport aircraft and features a prominent rotating radar dome, or rotodome, on its fuselage. This design suggests Beijing remains committed to this type of surveillance aircraft, even as other global militaries have shifted away from the technology, deeming it less suitable for modern warfare. The blurry images provide the first clues about the advanced capabilities of this new addition to China's military fleet.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry in response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase domestic beef production and consumption. Key measures include implementing a quality-grading system for local beef to enhance its appeal and promoting the nutritional benefits of high-quality protein. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to strengthen key agricultural sectors and unleash new consumer potential for high-quality domestic farm products.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban following a federal appeals court ruling. On Friday, a D.C. circuit court panel issued an order that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. In response, Customs and Border Protection officials were instructed to cease deportations linked to the ban and instead process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law. The original ban, which declared illegal immigration an emergency, was challenged by the ACLU.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, underscoring their close strategic alignment in the Indo-Pacific. The deal is part of Australia's major military restructuring to counter China's expansion, aiming to more than double its fleet of major warships. This marks Japan's first export of warships since before World War II, a significant step given its post-war pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous and medical waste in California. The lawsuit, filed by 45 county district attorneys, followed a multi-year investigation into 140 UPS locations.

UPS, which cooperated with the investigation, has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs to address the issues raised in the suit.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle, in a cave system in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was made during a survey of caverns near Ingleborough as part of a National Lottery-funded project. The research team, working with local cave explorers, also found evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into how early humans lived and farmed in the region during prehistory and highlight the importance of preserving ancient landscapes.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the retailer's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a Truth Social post, Trump called the ad the "HOTTEST" out there and encouraged people to buy the jeans, which he said were "flying off the shelves." The endorsement came amid controversy, as some online critics accused the ad of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denies. The stock rally provides a boost for the retailer, which has recently faced significant financial challenges, including slow sales and merchandise write-offs.</p>
