          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Sergio Gor, a close aide and director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, as the next U.S. ambassador to India. Gor's nomination comes at a time of strained relations with New Delhi, particularly over trade and tariff disputes. In his announcement, Trump emphasized his trust in Gor to represent his agenda in a crucial region. The nomination is now pending confirmation by the U.S. Senate, during which Gor will continue his current duties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Widely shared photos on social media show deer with alarming, bulbous warts, which wildlife experts identify as cutaneous fibromas. These skin tumors are caused by a papillomavirus that is common in deer populations and is typically spread through insect bites or direct contact. While the growths may look severe, they are usually harmless and do not affect the animal's overall health unless their size or location interferes with its ability to see, eat, or move. The meat of an affected deer is considered safe to eat.</p>

The report highlights the company's strong fundamentals and its critical role in providing AI-driven solutions for data centers, robotics, and cloud services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK-based company Excel Parking has been ordered to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing its court appeal against a young woman it had pursued for thousands of pounds in parking charges. The case centered on the firm's controversial "five-minute payment rule," which has been widely criticized and is now banned. The woman, who was defended pro bono, hopes her victory encourages others to stand up against what she and her supporters describe as the company's relentless and bullying tactics.</p>

          <p>The price of Ether surged to a new record high for the first time since 2021, following dovish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that hinted at potential interest rate cuts. The speech appeared to catch traders by surprise, triggering a wave of buying and causing around $120 million in short liquidations within a single hour. This panicked repositioning reversed recent risk-off sentiment in the crypto market and also boosted the shares of companies with significant exposure to Ether and other digital assets.
