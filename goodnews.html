          <p>A significant outage in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) primary US-East-1 region caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and online services, including Disney+, Reddit, and several airlines. The issue, which stemmed from DNS problems with its DynamoDB database service, impacted over 70 of AWS's own services and even affected internal Amazon operations like warehouses and delivery systems. AWS, which controls about a third of the cloud infrastructure market, reported that it had fully mitigated the DNS issue and services were returning to normal, though some customers might still experience throttled requests. This event highlights the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers, where a single technical fault can have a cascading global impact.</p>

          <p>Comfort Colors, a half-century-old T-shirt brand owned by Gildan, has seen a significant surge in popularity, particularly among Gen Z consumers who value its comfortable, vintage-style apparel. The brand, known for its 100% U.S. cotton shirts and unique pigment-dyeing process, has become a favorite for college groups, musicians' tour merchandise, and online printers. This growth, with a reported 40% year-over-year increase in 2024, has helped boost sales in Gildan's activewear category and has led to plans for expansion into new product lines. Despite being owned by a large corporation, Comfort Colors maintains a 'crunchy' and 'homey' brand image that resonates with its loyal customer base.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that Elon Musk's SpaceX is falling behind schedule on its contract to develop a lunar landing system for NASA's Artemis III mission. Citing the importance of winning the 'second space race against the Chinese,' Duffy announced his intention to open the contract to other companies to ensure the U.S. returns to the moon promptly. NASA has already pushed back the Artemis mission timelines, with the lunar landing now scheduled for 2027. Duffy suggested that competitor Blue Origin could be a potential alternative, emphasizing that the administration will not wait for a single company and aims to achieve a moon landing within the current president's term.</p>

          <p>An executive coach and author outlines five practical strategies for effectively working with a 'control freak' boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with specific phrasing, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the 'yes, and...' method to incorporate feedback while still asserting one's own ideas. The article suggests that these approaches can help conserve energy and build a more productive relationship by managing the superior's need for control.</p>

          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude sometime this week. Speaking on CNBC, Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats may soon move to reopen the government, allowing for policy negotiations to resume through regular order. He also warned that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider 'stronger measures' to compel Democrats to cooperate. The current impasse is centered on a partisan dispute over federal funding, with Democrats demanding the inclusion of extended Affordable Care Act subsidies in any stopgap spending bill.</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual 'Carrie Bradshaw Index,' which ranks U.S. cities based on the affordability of living alone on a median salary. The index uses the 30% rule for rent and found that cities like Wichita, Kansas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, are among the most affordable for single dwellers. Wichita topped the list, with median wages being 75% higher than what is needed to rent a typical studio apartment. The report also noted a trend of previously affordable cities, particularly in Texas, becoming unaffordable due to rising rents, likely driven by an influx of middle-class workers.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed companies involved in the rare earth supply chain experienced a surge as the Trump administration signals stronger industrial policy to combat China's market control. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced plans to set a price floor for these critical minerals, which are essential for technology and defense applications. This follows a deal with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, and has fueled investor speculation that the government will back additional domestic producers. The moves are part of a broader strategy to build a secure domestic supply chain for minerals vital to electric vehicles, semiconductors, and military hardware. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as 'El Gato' and a former FBI top ten fugitive, is facing a new federal charge that makes him eligible for the death penalty. The charge is connected to the 2013 murder-for-hire of a man in a Southlake, Texas, shopping center, which was allegedly an act of revenge against a rival cartel. Villareal-Hernandez, accused of orchestrating the hit, was on the run for years before his arrest in Mexico in 2023 and subsequent extradition to the U.S. The new indictment for 'continuing a criminal enterprise' adds to existing charges and underscores the long-term efforts of law enforcement to bring him to justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With over 40% of American adults classified as obese, the article argues for expanding Medicaid to cover new anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic, known as GLP-1s, despite their high cost. These medications have shown near-miraculous results in weight loss and also provide benefits for related conditions like diabetes, liver disease, and even substance abuse. The primary obstacle is the potential strain on state budgets, but the author contends these cost concerns are overstated due to several factors. These include long-term healthcare savings from reduced obesity, the likelihood of negotiating lower prices for Medicaid, and the expectation that drug prices will fall as more competitors enter the market.</p>

          <p>After peaking near 7% at the start of the year, average 30-year mortgage rates have eased into the low-to-mid 6% range, but their future direction depends heavily on inflation and labor market data. Experts predict that if inflation remains controlled and the job market shows continued signs of weakness, rates could fall further, potentially dipping below 6%. However, with the government shutdown delaying the release of key economic data, markets are currently relying on state-level and private sources.

          <p>According to Columbia University business psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, mastering specific social skills is more beneficial for career advancement than simply 'being yourself.' He identifies three crucial abilities: being receptive to honest, critical feedback; developing social awareness by focusing more on others' perspectives and needs; and practicing adaptability by stepping out of one's comfort zone to learn new skills. Chamorro-Premuzic argues that these components of emotional intelligence make individuals more employable and rewarding to work with. Cultivating these skills helps close the gap between self-perception and reality, ultimately leading to greater professional growth and success.</p>

          <p>Despite facing what Ford's CEO described as 'a lot of cost and a lot of chaos' from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. auto industry has proven more resilient than many analysts expected for 2025. Initial bearish outlooks have been tempered by better-than-anticipated sales and production figures, with S&P Global recently revising its U.S. light vehicle sales estimates upward. While challenges like tariff costs, stress in subprime auto lending, and uncertainty from the government shutdown persist, the industry is navigating the headwinds. This creates a 'cautiously optimistic' outlook as major automakers like GM and Ford prepare to report their third-quarter earnings.</p>
