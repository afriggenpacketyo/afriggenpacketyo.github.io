        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal has finalized the signing of Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee approaching £60 million. The 26-year-old deep-lying midfielder has signed a five-year contract, becoming the Gunners' second major summer acquisition. The deal was reportedly a long-term project for manager Mikel Arteta, with Arsenal having laid the groundwork for the transfer a year in advance to fend off interest from other clubs, including Liverpool. The article details the complex negotiations, which involved structuring the payment to avoid a lump-sum release clause, highlighting the strategic planning behind the high-profile move.</p>

          <p>Actress Jenilee Harrison, known for replacing Suzanne Somers on the sitcom "Three's Company," has revealed that she insisted on remaining clothed for her 1987 Playboy photoshoot. In a recent interview, Harrison explained that her contract stipulated she would not be nude, a demand that initially shocked the photographer and required a complete production halt to bring in wardrobe. She reflected on her discomfort with being a sex symbol, viewing it as a professional role rather than her true identity. Harrison is now co-hosting a podcast, "Stall Talk," where she shares stories and wisdom from her life and career experiences.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 07:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surprising victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary is being hailed as a major success for ranked-choice voting (RCV). Starting with just 1% in early polls, Mamdani's campaign was able to build momentum without being pushed out of the race, a common fate for long-shot candidates under traditional plurality systems. RCV encouraged a more positive, coalition-building campaign style, with candidates cross-endorsing each other and focusing on issues rather than attacks. The system's success is reflected in high voter satisfaction and historic turnout, suggesting it offers a potential model for reducing polarization in elections.</p>

          <p>A cultural conversation is growing around the relationship between Black Americans and the American flag, exploring how the symbol is being reclaimed by artists and the community. This article features commentary from Ted Johnson, a retired US Navy commander, who discusses the flag's complicated history, representing both ideals worth dying for and a system of oppression. The piece examines the motivations of Black service members throughout history and the modern reclamation of patriotic imagery by figures like Beyoncé. It posits that this reclamation is a powerful statement of ownership and belonging, asserting that America is home despite its history of racial injustice.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Establish Family Hubs in Every English Local Authority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 06:37:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out 'Best Start' family hubs to every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs will offer a wide range of services, from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, aiming to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. The policy expands on a previous Conservative initiative that established 400 hubs in 75 local authorities. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the plan will provide a vital lifeline to families and is a core part of the government's mission to improve children's life chances.</p>

          <p>A group of whitewater boaters staged a unique protest on California's Kern River by carrying their raft for 16 miles along a section dewatered by a hydroelectric dam. Southern California Edison's Fairview Dam diverts a significant portion of the river's flow to a power plant, often leaving the riverbed impassable for boaters. As Edison seeks to renew its federal license for the plant, rafters and local businesses are demanding that more water be left in the river to support recreation and the local economy. The protest aimed to raise awareness about the impact of the water diversions on one of Southern California's premier rafting destinations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Central Intelligence Agency and Hollywood share a long, complex history of mutual influence and collaboration that extends beyond on-screen portrayals. The CIA actively recruits talent from the entertainment industry, valuing skills in storytelling, makeup, and illusion for spycraft, and has historically partnered with Hollywood figures for covert operations. One famous example is the 'Canadian Caper,' dramatized in the film "Argo," where CIA operatives used the cover of a film crew to rescue diplomats from Iran. This revolving door of talent and inspiration helps the agency devise creative solutions and shape its public image, even as it battles cinematic misrepresentations.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop Faster, More Efficient Data Sorting System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 05:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Peking University have developed a new data sorting method that is faster and more energy-efficient, potentially overcoming a key bottleneck in computing. The system uses memristors, an electronic component that combines processing and memory functions, to perform 'sort-in-memory' operations. This approach avoids the data transfer delays inherent in traditional computer architecture, where memory and processing units are separate. The team built a hardware prototype that demonstrated significant speed and efficiency gains in tasks like AI neural network inference, offering a promising solution for high-performance computing applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with some participants in a clinical trial regaining significant hearing after a single injection. The therapy targets a genetic mutation in the OTOF gene, which prevents the transmission of sound signals from the ear to the brain. Researchers used a harmless virus to deliver a healthy copy of the gene into the inner ear of 10 participants, including children and adults. The treatment was found to be safe and effective, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing, offering hope for treating other forms of genetic hearing loss.</p>

          <p>During celebrations for his 90th birthday in Dharamshala, India, the Dalai Lama confirmed his intention for the institution to continue after his death, putting an end to speculation. He stated that his reincarnation will occur in the 'free world,' a clear rejection of Chinese authority over the process. This announcement was swiftly condemned by Beijing, which insists it must approve any successor. The festivities drew thousands of followers, monks, and dignitaries, who gathered to honor the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, who assured them he was in great physical condition and planned to live for many more decades.</p>
