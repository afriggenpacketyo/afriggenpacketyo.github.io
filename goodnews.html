          <p>China has launched a diplomatic strategy to strengthen ties with various trade partners amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. Beijing is promoting a shift towards a multipolar world, advocating for the defense of the "rules-based, UN-centred" international system.

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed a novel solution to President Trump's efforts to neutralize federal civil service protections. Trump has effectively stripped civil servants of protections against political firings by undermining the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the special counsel's office. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole and safeguard civil service protections.</p>
