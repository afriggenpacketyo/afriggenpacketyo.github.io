          <p>Friday's newspaper headlines are dominated by the man charged in the Liverpool victory parade incident, with The Guardian reporting Paul Doyle's charge of "grievous bodily harm" and the UK's potential ¬£1.6 billion trade agreement with Gulf states. The Daily Telegraph highlights the Liverpool suspect and Attorney General Lord Hermer's comparison of politicians' threats to abandon international law to "1930s Nazi Germany." The Times also leads with Lord Hermer's "Nazi jibe" against Tory and Reform politicians, while the Daily Mail features the Liverpool suspect and Kemi Badenoch's criticism of Nigel Farage. The Financial Times reports Donald Trump's pledge to "fight on" after a trade court ruling against his tariff scheme. The Metro covers Sir Keir's warning about Farage's potential economic impact, and the Daily Express reports on a "revolutionary" blood test for cancer being rolled out by the NHS.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory approach to cryptocurrency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This decision coincides with efforts by the Trump administration to position itself as an ally to the crypto industry. Binance is also deepening its involvement in Pakistan, where Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to the newly formed Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a severe spring of toxic algae blooms that sickened sea lions and posed risks to beachgoers, experts indicate that the worst of the poisoning is over in Southern California. The Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro reports no new patients with domoic acid poisoning and no recent signs of Pseudo-nitzschia algae. This year's bloom was the longest, most toxic, and deadliest experienced, pushing the center to its limits as it treated over 400 marine animals. Researchers link the increase in such blooms to climate change and nutrient runoff, urging continued monitoring and expansion of rescue efforts.</p>
