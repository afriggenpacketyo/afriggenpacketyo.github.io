          <p>The Trump administration is actively working to broker a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, following a series of high-level meetings at the White House. President Trump stated he would facilitate the initial meeting before potentially joining later to finalize a deal, emphasizing the need for flexibility from both sides to end the war. While a date has not been set, the discussions included European leaders and focused on establishing security guarantees for Ukraine post-conflict. The U.S. has ruled out deploying ground troops but may offer other forms of support in coordination with European allies.</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial savings, high-yield savings accounts offer a compelling alternative to traditional accounts or riskier investments like stocks. With current competitive rates, a $150,000 deposit could generate significant returns, potentially earning over $6,500 in interest within a single year, assuming a stable APY of around 4.35%. This earning potential starkly contrasts with the minimal interest offered by most brick-and-mortar banks, where the same amount would struggle to outpace inflation. The article advises savers to also consider factors like fees and account features when choosing an institution. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is reportedly expanding its iPhone manufacturing operations in India, a move that coincides with growing pressure from the White House on India over its continued purchases of Russian oil. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that secondary tariffs may be imposed on India for what he termed "profiteering" from sanctioned Russian oil. As these geopolitical tensions escalate, Apple's strategy to diversify its supply chain away from China appears to be accelerating. The expansion in India, involving partners like Tata Group and Foxconn, is part of a broader effort to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply-demand imbalance as the baby boomer generation ages, with millions expected to turn 80 in the coming years. Despite rising occupancy rates, new construction has slowed to its lowest level since 2006, primarily due to higher interest rates hindering development. This has created a strong investment environment for existing property owners and real estate investment trusts like Ventas, which are acquiring properties below replacement cost. Industry experts note that this supply constraint, combined with durable demand, presents a uniquely strong entry point for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has reaffirmed the AA+ credit rating for the United States, maintaining a stable outlook. The agency stated that increased revenue from the Trump administration's tariffs is expected to offset the fiscal impact of recent tax cuts, thereby supporting the nation's financial standing. This assessment contrasts with a recent downgrade from Moody's, which cited concerns over growing national debt and policy uncertainty. While acknowledging economic headwinds like slowing GDP growth, S&P highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy and the significant surge in tariff collections as key factors in its decision.

          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in federal prison for conspiring to smuggle weapons, ammunition, and sensitive U.S. technology to North Korea. Wen pleaded guilty to acting as an illegal agent for a foreign government, admitting he received approximately $2 million from North Korean officials to procure the goods. He concealed the contraband in shipping containers falsely labeled as consumer products and successfully exported at least two shipments from California. Federal agents discovered his activities after seizing ammunition and sensitive detection devices intended for North Korea's military during searches of his home and vehicle.</p>

          <p>The San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians has received a land donation of a half-acre property in San Gabriel, California, marking the first time the tribe has owned a piece of its ancestral territory. The land, which includes a community center, was transferred for $0 from the Presbytery of San Gabriel, a unit of the Presbyterian Church. This historic event provides a permanent space for the tribe, which lacks federal recognition, to hold cultural ceremonies, government meetings, and community programs. The land return is seen as a significant step toward healing and recognition after centuries of displacement and erasure.</p>

Management reaffirmed its full-year guidance, expressing confidence in continued growth. The positive market reaction is also fueled by expectations that anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will stimulate the housing market, which is a key driver of Home Depot's business, by making mortgages and home improvement loans more affordable.

          <p>A Southern California family and a woman seeking grandchildren have formed a deep bond through the Facebook group "Surrogate Grandparents USA." The Turner family, whose biological grandparents are distant or not involved, connected with Janet Firestein Daw, who wanted the experience of being a grandmother. Over the past two years, "Nana J" has become an integral part of the family, celebrating holidays, going on trips, and providing the intergenerational connection the family was missing. The story highlights a growing trend of people forming non-traditional family structures to fill personal voids and build a supportive "village."</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a reader asks if they are obligated to care for their elderly and unkind stepfather, who now lives alone next to their sister. The columnist, James Parker, acknowledges the reader's past grievances but advises them to rise above them and show kindness. He argues that actively ignoring someone is stressful and that offering help, such as checking in or bringing a meal, can be a powerful act of generosity. Parker reframes the act not as an obligation, but as a way to rebalance the scales, suggesting that a graciously presented casserole can be a form of positive, personal closure.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a shift from the previous administration's policy, which treated the funds as grants. The move is part of the Trump administration's strategy to ensure taxpayers get a return on the government's investment in reshoring semiconductor manufacturing. The announcement comes as Intel's stock rallied amid reports of increased government involvement and a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank, aimed at bolstering the struggling chipmaker's domestic production capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite past efforts by Congress to ban TikTok on national security grounds, the social media app has become a surprisingly effective tool for military recruitment, particularly for young women. In a challenging labor market where finding enough recruits is difficult, the U.S. armed forces are benefiting from the visibility and connection offered by the platform. This trend presents a contrast to some traditionalist views within the military establishment, including those previously expressed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, regarding the role of women in the armed forces.

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is prompting a significant shift in education, with teachers exploring how to use it as a tool while addressing concerns about cheating and diminished critical thinking. Some educators are actively teaching students both the capabilities and limitations of AI. In a major initiative, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic are investing $23 million to train members of the American Federation of Teachers on AI integration. While proponents argue AI can save teachers time and enhance learning, critics worry about corporate influence and believe the focus should be on improving fundamental working conditions for educators rather than relying on technological solutions.</p>
