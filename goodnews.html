          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly advised President Donald Trump to decline the offer of a $400 million jet from Qatar's royal family, citing concerns regarding national security and Qatar's history of divided allegiances. Pence emphasized the potential risks associated with intelligence gathering and ensuring the president's safety during international travel. He suggested that if Qatar wishes to make a gesture of goodwill, they should instead invest the money in infrastructure improvements at a U.S. military base. Trump previously attributed any acceptance of the aircraft to delays from Boeing, the U.S. manufacturer.</p>
