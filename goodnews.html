          <p>News that former President Joseph Biden has advanced prostate cancer has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the U.S. The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers and to wait and watch cancers that might never become troublesome. </p>

While real estate values have increased significantly, the stock market has provided substantially higher returns, making it Buffett's preferred investment choice. (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>The US has accepted a plane from Qatar for the Air Force One fleet, a gift that has sparked controversy. The Boeing 747 will require modifications before it can be used as part of Air Force One. The White House insists that the gift is legal, but the transfer has not received congressional approval. The president has argued that the plane transfer is legal because it is being given to the US defence department, and not to him personally. </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, a U-turn following political pressure. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments when the pension top-up became means-tested last year. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said ministers would change the threshold to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again. But it remains unclear how many will regain their entitlement for the payments, or when the changes will take effect. </p>
