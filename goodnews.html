          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income surpassed analyst estimates, though it showed an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders, classifying the financial unit as a discontinued operation starting this quarter. The company's outlook for the financial year ending in March 2026 was conservative, projecting a slight increase in operating profit, partially offset by the impact of U.S. tariffs, though this may be affected by the recent U.S.-China trade deal.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they are struggling to find qualified money managers. The number of family offices is expected to grow to 10,720 by 2030, managing $5.4 trillion in assets, but the industry faces a potential shortage of 100,000 advisors by 2034. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, and compete with banks and private equity firms for talent, with some families willing to pay a salary premium for trusted individuals. Young employees are also reluctant to work at family offices due to unclear corporate structures and perceptions of it being a "retirement job."</p>

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils challenges the notion that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting the presence of polar ice 140 million years ago. During this time, the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius, comparable to today's variations. Researchers from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research and other international institutions published their findings in Science Advances, indicating that the "Early Cretaceous greenhouse Earth was like a symphony ‚Äì its warm melodies occasionally punctuated by brief glacial notes." Applying these findings to the present day offers insights into climate change, particularly concerning the ongoing reductions in Arctic and Antarctic ice.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially setting the stage for their release after more than three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' demonstrated rehabilitation through education and self-help groups within prison as a key factor in his decision. The brothers addressed the court, taking responsibility for their actions and apologizing to their relatives. The decision now shifts attention to state parole officials, who are scheduled to consider the brothers' case in June, amidst ongoing debate over their rehabilitation and the nature of their crimes.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly proposed the idea to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, although Mr. Witkoff's spokesperson denied that the proposal had come up in the talks. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from multiple countries providing oversight. This venture would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address U.S. concerns about Iran's nuclear program.</p>

However, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu, which has impacted egg-laying hen populations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from various countries to stabilize supply.</p>
