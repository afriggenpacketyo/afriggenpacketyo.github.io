          <h2>UK Government Invests Millions to Expand GP Surgeries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 23:45:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is allocating ¬£102 million to over 1,000 GP surgeries to facilitate upgrades and expansions, aiming to improve patient access and reduce waiting times. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that this investment, the largest in five years, will modernize facilities and enable doctors to treat more patients. This initiative is part of a broader plan to overhaul the health service and address the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments, with nearly 45% of GP appointments occurring on the day they are booked. The government hopes this will boost patient satisfaction, which has declined since the pandemic due to fewer in-person appointments. Ruth Rankine of the NHS Confederation welcomed the investment as vital for shifting care from hospitals to the community.</p>
