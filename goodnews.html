          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' urging them to overcome their reservations and support the legislation, which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts, increasing military and immigration enforcement spending, and cutting Medicaid and clean energy subsidies. Despite Trump's pressure, many Republicans remained unconvinced, seeking further changes before committing their support. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated with various factions to address their concerns, aiming to secure enough votes for the bill's passage, but faced challenges in balancing the demands of conservatives and moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>A recent LendingTree report indicates that fast-food prices in major U.S. cities have risen, with the average meal now costing $11.56. San Francisco has the highest prices, averaging $13.88 per meal, while Columbus, Ohio, is the most affordable at $10.01. FinanceBuzz found that average fast-food prices have increased significantly over the past decade, with some items doubling in cost. The rising prices are impacting lower-income workers, who spend a considerable portion of their wages on fast food, and McDonald's has reported a drop in sales due to economic anxieties and tariffs.</p>

          <p>Chris Brown, the American singer, has been released on bail by a London court after being charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm in an alleged "unprovoked attack." The 36-year-old was arrested in Salford last week and charged in connection with an incident at a London nightclub in 2023. Brown was not required to appear in person at Southwark Crown Court when Judge Tony Baumgartner granted him bail, but he must pay a ¬£5m security fee to the court.

          <p>Vani Hari, formerly known as the Food Babe, has transitioned from dispensing diet and fitness tips to becoming a significant voice in the Trump administration's healthy-food agenda.

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers have set a new record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, used xenon to pre-acclimatize to low oxygen at high altitudes, enabling a faster ascent compared to the typical six to eight weeks. While the use of xenon remains disputed within the mountaineering community, organizers claim it facilitated the rapid climb, as the team slept for six weeks in special tents before traveling to Nepal. The team was accompanied by five Sherpa guides and a cameraman.</p>

          <p>Official data reveals that the UK inflation rate has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest in over a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity. This figure exceeds economists' expectations and is further above the Bank of England's target of 2%. Economists now believe that this inflation figure makes it more likely that there will be only one interest rate cut this year, as opposed to the two that were previously expected. The cost of services specifically rose 5.4% in the year to April.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was surprised by Trump's direct negotiations with Hamas and Iran, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was angered by Trump's remarks on the India-Pakistan conflict. Even Viktor Orb√°n of Hungary is facing challenges due to his close economic ties with China amid Trump's pressure to decouple from Beijing.

          <p>Donald Trump's recent Middle East trip has been remarkably successful due to his focus on American business interests and his willingness to navigate Middle East politics without being constrained by domestic concerns. By bringing American industry leaders to meetings and promising no more nation-building projects, Trump has positioned the U.S. as a commercial and strategic partner. He has also made decisions, such as announcing a cease-fire with the Houthis and negotiating with Iran, that other presidents would have found politically difficult. However, to maintain this success, Trump needs to balance business interests with other priorities and ensure the U.S. remains an attractive investment destination.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that people should not be able to camp without permission. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. This decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where there is no general right to wild camp on most private land.</p>

          <p>Data from Beijing indicates that overseas buyers may have been stockpiling rare earth elements, which are vital for electronics, electric vehicles, and defense systems, in anticipation of potential export controls amid China-US trade tensions. The export volume of these elements reached a nine-month high of 5,600 tonnes in March, showing a year-on-year increase of 20.3%. In April, although sales decreased, they still rose by 4.8% year-on-year, totaling 4,785 tonnes. Specifically, outbound shipments of niche rare earth metals, such as metallic scandium and metallic yttrium, saw a significant increase of 20.9% year on year in April.</p>

          <h2>Pakistani Doctors Treat Elephants for Tuberculosis with 400 Pills a Day</h2>

          <p>In Pakistan, a team of doctors and vets at the Karachi Safari Park has developed a treatment for two elephants suffering from tuberculosis, involving the administration of at least 400 pills a day. The tablets, the same as those used to treat TB in humans, are hidden inside food such as apples, bananas, and Pakistani sweets. The amount of medication is adjusted based on the elephants' weight, and minders wear face masks and scrubs to avoid contracting the disease. It is believed the elephants contracted the illness from humans, which is not uncommon.</p>

          <p>For the first time, West Nile virus has been detected in UK mosquitoes, according to UK health officials. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found fragments of the virus in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected at ponds near Retford, Nottinghamshire in 2023. While the risk to the general public is considered "very low" and there have been no human cases acquired in the UK, this discovery is part of a wider changing landscape where climate change may bring non-native species to the UK and, with them, the potential of infectious disease.</p>

          <h2>Trump Urges House Republicans to Avoid Medicaid Cuts Amid Bill Push</h2>

          <p>President Trump has urged House Republicans not to "mess with Medicaid" as they push to pass a bill advancing his legislative agenda. As hard-liners push for stricter Medicaid cuts, Trump's demand comes ahead of a vote on the bill, which includes a cap on state and local tax deductions. The president has expressed impatience with Republican holdouts and emphasized the need for unity to deliver for the American people, but some Republicans are still considering changes to the bill before it goes to the House Rules Committee.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public outrage over his comments about receiving free rice as gifts, which struck a nerve amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The resignation comes as Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings and grapples with ongoing tariff negotiations with the U.S. and soaring food prices.</p>
