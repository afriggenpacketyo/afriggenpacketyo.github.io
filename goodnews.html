The deal also includes the release of Palestinian prisoners and is being hailed as a major diplomatic achievement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts assert that the 10-year Treasury yield has a more direct and significant impact on mortgage interest rates than the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. While the Fed's decisions influence short-term borrowing costs and overall economic sentiment, mortgage rates more closely follow the long-term Treasury yield, typically running about 1.5% to 2.0% higher. This is because the duration of Treasury bonds better aligns with the average life of a mortgage loan. Lenders and investors use the 10-year yield as a primary guide for pricing mortgage products.

The absences could provide opportunities for other players, such as Chelsea's Millie Bright or Arsenal teenager Katie Reid, to step into prominent roles.

          <p>Lego has donated over 10,000 specially designed MRI scanner sets to hospitals worldwide, which are proving effective in reducing anxiety among pediatric patients. The play sets allow children to familiarize themselves with the MRI procedure through hands-on interaction, helping to demystify the experience. A new study found that 96% of healthcare professionals believe the models help ease children's fears, and nearly half reported a reduced need for sedation after children played with the set. The initiative is part of Lego's effort to use its products for positive social impact beyond commercial sales.</p>

          <p>As of October 10, 2025, average national interest rates for mortgages and refinancing remain elevated compared to previous years, reflecting the Federal Reserve's rate hikes. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.49%, while a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averages 5.87%. Refinance rates are similar, with a 30-year loan at 6.52%. Experts advise that borrowers can still secure better rates by improving their credit scores, shopping around with different lenders, and comparing all loan terms and fees before committing.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advises young investors to allocate a portion of their portfolio to speculative stocks, arguing it is a prudent way to potentially build long-term wealth. While he recommends that about half of investments should be in safe, diversified index funds, he suggests dedicating a small part to high-risk, high-reward assets. Cramer believes that young people have the time to recover from potential losses on such speculations, making the risk of chasing significant returns worthwhile. This strategy involves betting on emerging technologies or themes one believes in, despite their current lack of fundamental strength. (not investment advice)</p>

Halted activities include benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, processing overpayments, and issuing replacement Medicare cards.

This is the first arrest in the case since 2017, and police are continuing the investigation while keeping Lindsay's family updated.

          <p>A prominent academic has suggested that China's latest trade "countermeasures" against the United States could paradoxically be a positive step toward stabilizing the relationship between the two economic giants. The argument is that these retaliatory actions might compel the Trump administration to adopt a more realistic and grounded approach in its trade negotiations with Beijing. This analysis comes as the White House has recently softened its rhetoric regarding the renewed trade tensions. Both sides still appear willing to proceed with planned meetings, indicating a potential path to de-escalation despite the recent tit-for-tat actions.</p>
