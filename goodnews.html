          <p>Former President Donald Trump suggested that his negative remarks about Taylor Swift have negatively impacted her popularity, stating that she is "no longer 'HOT'" since he said "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT." A White House official humorously commented on Trump's qualifications as a business and entertainment mogul to assess celebrity rises and falls. This statement follows Swift's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris in the past, leading to Trump's initial expression of dislike. The article notes Swift's recent lower public profile due to the end of her Eras tour and the conclusion of her boyfriend Travis Kelce's football season, and also mentions Trump's past comments on Swift's political views and talent.</p>

          <p>Japanese automakers are grappling with the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars, with limited immediate options to offset the financial burden. Toyota, Honda, and Nissan are expected to rely on robust sales of fuel-efficient models in the U.S. market and may consider price increases to mitigate the tariff impact. The additional tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars and auto parts, are projected to significantly reduce profits for Japanese carmakers. While increasing local production is a long-term strategy, automakers are hesitant to make hasty moves without clarity on the duration of the tariffs.</p>

Merz faces the challenge of leading an unwieldy coalition, requiring him to address issues like immigration and the economy to prevent voters from turning to extremism.

          <p>As the Trump administration ramps up collection efforts on student loans, borrowers are advised to understand the difference between delinquency and default, as only those in default face garnishments. Delinquent borrowers should contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in an affordable repayment plan. Borrowers in default can contact the government's Default Resolution Group to explore options such as income-driven repayment or loan rehabilitation.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court's approach to police violence cases in Barnes v. Felix, sending the case back to the Fifth Circuit for reconsideration. The Court criticized the Fifth Circuit's narrow focus on the "moment of the threat," arguing that courts must consider the "totality of the circumstances" leading up to a shooting or use of force. Justice Kagan's opinion emphasized that a wider lens does not necessarily favor either police or injured individuals, but is essential for determining the reasonableness of the use of force.</p>
