          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal has signed 20-year-old Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool for a world-record fee of £1 million, making it the most expensive transfer in women's football history. Smith, who has signed a four-year contract, is considered one of the sport's most promising young talents, known for her pace and direct attacking style. The deal surpasses the previous record set by Chelsea's signing of Naomi Girma. For Liverpool, the sale represents significant profit and includes a sell-on clause, with the funds intended for strengthening their squad in multiple areas. Smith's impressive career includes a successful season at Liverpool and accolades at the international level with Canada.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Once seen as a novelty, foldable smartphones are becoming a viable alternative to the standard slab design that has dominated the market for over a decade. This article explores the growing appeal of devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7, which offer adaptable screen sizes for different tasks, evoking the nostalgia of older flip phones. While some tech leaders predict a future of AI pins and augmented reality glasses, the smartphone remains the central gadget for the foreseeable future. Foldables represent a significant innovation, offering a bridge between current technology and future concepts by providing users with more control over their screen time and immersion.</p>

          <h2>PepsiCo Exceeds Q2 Earnings Estimates Despite Weaker North American Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:48:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as the company experienced a decline in demand within its North American food and beverage markets. The company's adjusted earnings per share were $2.12 on revenue of $22.73 billion, beating analyst forecasts. However, overall volume fell, with a 1% shrink in its North American food division and a 2% drop in its domestic drinks segment. To counter this, PepsiCo is focusing on cost-cutting measures, improving profit margins, and targeting growth areas like protein-based products and multicultural offerings, while reiterating its full-year financial outlook.

          <p>The opening day of the Meiji Yasuda Ladies golf tournament in northern Japan was canceled after a bear was spotted near the first tee. This incident marks the second time in two months that a professional women's golf event in Japan has been disrupted by a bear. Organizers prioritized the safety of players and staff, and a decision on the remainder of the tournament is pending. The event highlights a broader issue in Japan, where human-bear encounters have reached record levels. Experts attribute this to factors like climate change affecting food sources and shrinking rural populations, which allows bears to expand their habitats.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old Russian woman and her two young daughters, aged six and four, were discovered living in a cave within a remote, snake-infested forest in Karnataka, India. Police found the family during a routine patrol of the tourist area, where they had been living for over a week. The woman, Nina Kutina, reportedly told authorities she was interested in a life of worship and meditation in the forest. She is now facing repatriation to Russia for overstaying her visa, and the family has been moved to a detention facility. The incident highlights an unusual case of seeking an isolated lifestyle abroad, which ended due to visa violations.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, with a nearly 61% year-on-year increase, driven by sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chipmaker beat analyst estimates, with net income reaching NT$398.27 billion. The company's high-performance computing division, which serves clients like Nvidia and Apple, accounted for 60% of its revenue. Despite the strong performance, TSMC faces potential headwinds from President Trump's trade policies, which could include steep tariffs on semiconductors, though the company has not yet seen changes in customer behavior.

          <p>A new bill in California, AB 727, would require public schools and colleges to include the phone number for an LGBTQ-specific crisis hotline on student ID cards. The legislation is championed by advocates and the mother of a trans teen who died by suicide, who believe targeted support is crucial for queer youth. The move comes as the federal government cuts funding for LGBTQ+ counselors at the national 9-8-8 suicide lifeline, a decision critics fear will harm vulnerable populations. Supporters, including Governor Gavin Newsom, see the bill as a necessary state-level safety net to ensure young queer Californians have access to relatable and affirming mental health support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is praised in this review as a brilliant, if bleak, social satire set in a small New Mexico town during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as a local sheriff and Pedro Pascal as the mayor, whose rivalry is set against a backdrop of conspiracy theories, social media-induced brain sickness, and societal breakdown. The reviewer highlights the film's bitterly funny dialogue, sharp visual gags, and its unflinching portrayal of a lonely, divided America where every character seeks connection and correctness. While some plot points may not fully land, the film is described as a hysterical, humanistic, and culpability-inducing group therapy session for a fractured nation.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Givhan's latest novel, "Salt Bones," is lauded in this review as a triumphant and masterful blend of horror, mystery, and literary fiction. Set in a fictional town near the Salton Sea, the story follows a mother, Mal, whose past trauma is reignited when a young woman disappears, echoing the vanishing of her own sister two decades earlier. The reviewer praises Givhan's use of magical realism, including the folkloric figure La Siguanaba, and her skillful weaving of multiple perspectives to build a propulsive and haunting narrative. The novel is described as a powerful exploration of a community haunted by its history, infused with strong Mexican American and Indigenous culture.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival in Belgium have confirmed the event will go ahead, despite a major fire destroying its main stage on Wednesday. The festival, one of the world's largest, attracts up to 400,000 people annually. While no one was injured in the blaze, the destruction of the elaborately designed main stage is a significant blow. Organizers stated they worked through the night on solutions and were able to open the festival's campsite to attendees on Thursday as planned. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but the swift decision to continue demonstrates the resilience of the event's management.</p>

One major focus is the duel between England's defense, led by Leah Williamson, and Sweden's potent striker, Stina Blackstenius, who are teammates at Arsenal.
