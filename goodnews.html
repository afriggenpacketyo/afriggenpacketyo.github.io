          <p>Country music legend Alan Jackson, 66, has retired from touring after a 30-year career, citing his battle with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a degenerative nerve condition affecting his motor skills, diagnosed in 2011. Jackson performed his final tour show in Milwaukee on Saturday, marking the end of his "Last Call: One More for the Road Tour." Despite health issues, Jackson plans a finale show in Nashville next summer and intends to release new music, focusing on songwriting, which he finds more fulfilling than touring.

          <p>Portugal's governing right-of-centre Democratic Alliance has emerged victorious in snap parliamentary elections, the third in as many years, although it has once again failed to secure a majority. Luís Montenegro, the party's leader, pledged to stimulate investment and ensure prosperity and social justice for the nation. Meanwhile, Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation following his party's second-place finish, losing a significant number of seats and drawing close to the far-right Chega party. The final results may shift depending on overseas voters, which will take a few days to come in.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion, leader of the AUR party. Dan secured 55% of the vote, emphasizing the need to build Romania together, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. The election followed months of political turbulence, including the annulment of a previous vote due to claims of Russian interference, with Dan campaigning on fighting corruption and maintaining support for Ukraine. Despite Simion's strong support in the diaspora, Dan's victory signals a preference for a pro-EU direction.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years came to an end on Sunday after NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) reached an agreement. The union called off the strike at 6 p.m., with NJ Transit announcing that trains would resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning, and Governor Philip Murphy expressed relief, asking commuters to work from home on Monday for safety inspections. The main sticking point was the engineers' demand for pay parity with other passenger railroads, and the agreement involved some concessions by the engineers on work rules.</p>

Convertibility remains a concern among investors outside the mainland, and China's existing "connect" schemes with Hong Kong could serve as a model. (not investment advice)</p>
