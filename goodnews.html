          <h2>Tesla Stock Rises Amid Trump-Musk Tension</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla shares experienced a premarket surge following a period of volatility fueled by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, which had previously resulted in a substantial market capitalization loss for the company. The stock rebounded by 4.2% in premarket trading as analysts speculated about a potential truce brokered by a phone call between Musk and Trump, although this was later denied by Trump's Chief of Staff. Analysts suggest that a reconciliation between Musk and Trump would be beneficial for Tesla shares, which they believe were oversold due to the recent news. The dispute arose after Musk's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency concluded, leading to verbal exchanges between the two figures. Optimism surrounds the company as a result of the premarket surge.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first rate cut since September 2022, signaling a potential easing of inflation pressures. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the average of 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand growth still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the central bank stated that the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. The Bank of Russia plans to maintain a tight monetary policy for an extended period to achieve its inflation target of 4%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising global temperatures are challenging the resilience of roads, railways, and bridges, necessitating innovative solutions to prevent infrastructure failures. Extreme heat can cause roads to melt, rail lines to buckle, and bridges to expand, increasing maintenance needs and disrupting transportation. Strategies for mitigating these effects include using heat-reflective coatings on roads, painting rails white to absorb less heat, and incorporating expansion joints in bridges. Researchers are also exploring new materials and designs to ensure infrastructure can withstand the increasing stresses of a hotter climate, as demonstrated by the Goethals Bridge replacement project.</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases by selling them through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong. This move could support Hong Kong's ambition to become a virtual asset hub, and the municipal Public Security Bureau in Beijing has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) for this initiative. CBEX will appoint third-party agencies to sell the cryptoassets through regulated platforms in Hong Kong, with proceeds converted into yuan. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets through Hong Kong's virtual asset regime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's ban on Harvard's foreign students from entering the US, after the university argued it violated federal law. The judge also extended her block on another attempt by the administration to stop the university from issuing student visas, and the Ivy League school argued that the administration failed to support the president's claims that the students posed a threat to national security. The decision provides relief to Harvard's international students and challenges the administration's policies on immigration and education.</p>
