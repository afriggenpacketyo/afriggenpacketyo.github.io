          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote wilderness of British Columbia. He survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a makeshift shelter from sticks and moss. To attract attention, Barber carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led to his discovery by a search and rescue helicopter. He was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but is expected to recover.</p>

          <p>Paraguayan lawmakers are considering a proposal to allow local companies to assemble electronic and digital goods using imported components, primarily from China. The plan aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by shifting from importing fully assembled products to local manufacturing, with goods branded as "Made in Paraguay." Officials see an opportunity to position Paraguay as an assembly hub, capitalizing on recent U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and similar levies on Brazilian exports. The debate occurs as Paraguay weighs its diplomatic ties with Taiwan versus Beijing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the safety of reverse mortgages as a financial option for seniors aged 62 and older looking to supplement their retirement income by tapping into home equity. While most reverse mortgages are federally insured and regulated, they are not without risks. Homeowners must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and falling behind can lead to foreclosure. The loan balance grows over time, which can deplete equity intended for heirs, making it a complex decision that depends on an individual's long-term housing plans and financial situation.
