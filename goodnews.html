          <p>US and Chinese representatives met in London to discuss trade, marking a positive step despite existing challenges. The meeting, involving key officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the US side, aimed to address trade disputes between the two major economies. While the US expressed optimism, Chinese state media urged the US to honor its commitments. This round of talks follows a phone conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, indicating a willingness to find common ground despite persistent disagreements. Optimism among analysts remains tempered, as the path ahead is expected to be difficult. The meeting is hoped to ease trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault. Hardin impersonated a corrections officer to escape, leading to a nearly two-week-long manhunt in northern Arkansas. Law enforcement officials used bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and helicopters to track him down. Hardin was eventually found 1.5 miles from the prison and taken into custody without injury, bringing relief to the community he once served. The prison system is investigating the security lapse that allowed his escape.</p>

The article also addresses claims about the recyclability of wind turbines, noting that while some blades are buried, efforts are underway to improve recycling processes.

          <p>An article on NPR explores the concept of federal rental aid with time limits, focusing on a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and save money. The Delaware program includes a savings account that recipients can access when they leave the program, providing a financial cushion for their transition. While some housing policy experts support time limits as a way to encourage turnover and serve more people, others worry about the potential for harsh consequences, particularly in areas with high rent prices. A case study in Washington state showed that time limits did not necessarily improve outcomes for recipients.</p>

          <h2>China's Gen Z Alters Liquor Industry as Baijiu Consumption Declines</h2>

          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the liquor industry as their tastes shift away from traditional baijiu, leading to a decline in its consumption. In Baisha, a town famous for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to cater to the demand for lighter, fruitier wines. More Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products with a focus on low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages to appeal to younger demographics. This shift reflects a broader trend of younger consumers prioritizing self-indulgent experiences over traditional social rituals.</p>

          <h2>Unclaimed 401(k) Account Fees Can Cost Workers Thousands in Lost Retirement Savings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report indicates that former employees who leave their 401(k)s with previous employers may face additional fees that significantly reduce their retirement savings. These fees, along with lost compound growth, can amount to nearly $18,000 over time. While rolling funds into an IRA is an option, IRAs typically have higher investment fees than 401(k)s, potentially costing workers thousands more over decades (not investment advice). The Department of Labor has created a retirement savings lost and found database to help workers locate old retirement plans, and updating contact information with former employers is also crucial.</p>

          <p>An article on NPR reflects on Ncuti Gatwa's brief tenure as the Doctor on the British series Doctor Who, highlighting his role as the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the iconic character. Gatwa's Doctor brought a sense of newness and unapologetic queerness to the series, challenging traditional norms and expectations. The article also notes Gatwa's emotional availability and unique fashion sense, which contributed to a fresh and inclusive portrayal of the Doctor. Ultimately, Gatwa's casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anyone, addressing issues of racism and privilege in a meaningful way.</p>
