          <p>The upcoming week on Wall Street will be heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, where a 25-basis-point interest rate cut is widely anticipated. Investors will be closely watching Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference for signals about future monetary policy, especially after recent mixed inflation data and slowing jobs growth. Additionally, two major companies, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and industrial conglomerate DuPont, are scheduled to hold investor days. These events will provide insights into their respective strategies and financial outlooks, particularly concerning CrowdStrike's stock performance and DuPont's upcoming business spinoff.

          <p>Four clerks from different smoke shops in Jacksonville, Florida, have been arrested following an undercover investigation into the illegal sale of nitrous oxide for recreational use. According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, undercover agents purchased canisters of the gas, commonly known as "whippits," from the employees. The arrest reports state that the clerks confirmed the substance could be used for getting high and, in some cases, explained its effects to the agents. The arrests occurred at Max Smoke Shop, Smoke and Vape Atlantic, Smoking Aces, and Miami Smoke Shop as part of an effort to crack down on the misuse of the substance.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offers a fresh perspective on the lesser-known Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is famous for his masterpiece "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects, a departure from his contemporaries. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers," were considered scandalous at the time for their realistic and sensuous depictions of working-class men and male nudes. The show aims to integrate Caillebotte more fully into the story of Impressionism, allowing viewers to interpret the complex and beguiling artistry of his work.</p>

In an interview, he reflected on his career, his upbringing in a family of comedy legends, and how he has learned to channel pain into his performances. The film explores themes of ambition and temptation, with Wayans portraying a character who acts as an agent of evil.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the recent Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants and rebuild their community bonds. Founded by a resident who lost her home, the club organizes weekly gatherings at different local eateries, many of which have seen a sharp decline in business since the fire. The events provide a vital economic boost to struggling family-owned establishments and, more importantly, create a space for displaced and grieving neighbors to connect. For many members, sharing a meal with others who understand their loss has become an essential part of the healing and recovery process.</p>

          <p>Historians and legal experts are re-examining the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing its original design as a flexible document intended to be amended and adapted over time. As detailed in Jill Lepore's new book "We the People," the framers anticipated constant revision, with the Bill of Rights itself emerging from over 200 amendments proposed by the states during ratification. The document included compromises, notably on slavery, but was structured to allow future generations to create a "more perfect union." Experts like Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center argue that while the Constitution's principles are timeless, its mechanism for change has stalled.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, AI-voiced audio summaries of product information. The tool generates its scripts by analyzing data from product catalogs, customer reviews, and other web sources to distill key points for shoppers. This development raises questions about whether AI can effectively replace the nuanced and often idiosyncratic insights found in human-written reviews. While the feature could enhance accessibility for visually impaired customers, critics worry that by blending marketing language with user feedback, the AI summaries might dilute unique customer perspectives and unintentionally mislead consumers.</p>

          <p>Team Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Luke Donald, has implemented a novel training method to prepare his players for the anticipated hostile crowd at Bethpage, New York: virtual reality headsets that shout abuse. Rory McIlroy revealed that players were given the equipment to simulate the intense sights and sounds they will face from American fans. McIlroy stated he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," allowing players to desensitize themselves to potential name-calling and distractions. This attention to detail is part of Europe's strategy to overcome the challenge of winning on American soil, something they have not accomplished since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are weighing in on the key matchups and potential outcomes. While the absence of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese due to injury changes the narrative, the focus shifts to established stars and top-seeded teams. Experts identify the high-seeded Phoenix Mercury as a team at risk for an early exit. Many predict a finals matchup between the Las Vegas Aces and the Minnesota Lynx, with several analysts favoring the Lynx to complete their "revenge tour" and win the championship after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, led by likely MVP Napheesa Collier.</p>

          <p>Following a strong earnings season, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several technology stocks poised for long-term growth, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Semiconductor firm Broadcom is favored due to accelerating AI demand and a new $10 billion customer, believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity company Zscaler is highlighted for strong demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Finally, Oracle's stock is rising based on massive growth in its cloud business, with its remaining performance obligations surging 359% year-over-year, indicating robust future revenue from major AI-related contracts.

          <p>Senior trade delegations from the United States and China have convened in Madrid for their fourth round of face-to-face talks aimed at resolving escalating trade disputes. The meeting marks a continued effort to find common ground after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his tariff war earlier in the year. The negotiations, held at the Spanish foreign ministry, are critical for both nations as they seek to de-escalate tensions that have impacted the global economy. The choice of a neutral European venue underscores the international significance of the ongoing trade conflict between the two economic superpowers.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is being urged by the Commons Business and Trade Committee to intensify pressure on the U.S. to remove remaining tariffs on British steel. A trade deal signed in June reduced tariffs on some goods but left the 25% tariff on steel in place, a major sticking point in economic relations. The committee's report emphasizes that the high-profile visit is a key opportunity to finalize a lasting "economic prosperity deal" that would end the threat of future tariffs. The visit, Trump's second as president, is set to include significant pageantry. (not investment advice)</p>
