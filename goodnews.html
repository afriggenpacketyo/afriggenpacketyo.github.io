          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China are meeting in London to discuss resolving their ongoing trade dispute, following a preliminary agreement in Geneva to temporarily reduce tariffs. The talks aim to build on the Geneva agreement, which saw the U.S. lower tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China reduce levies on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. Both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement, with the U.S. citing slow approval of critical mineral exports and China criticizing restrictions on student visas and chip exports. The focus is on moving forward with the Geneva agreement and addressing strategic interests in each other's markets.</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho, a record 45-time elite-level tournament winner, plans to promote sumo from outside the Japan Sumo Association after severing ties with the sport's ruling body. His retirement from the association follows the indefinite closure of his Miyagino stable due to abuse allegations involving his protege, Hokuseiho. Hakuho aims to develop sumo from an external perspective, focusing on projects to spread the sport globally. Despite his split with the sumo hierarchy, he is remembered as an all-time great with a dominant career.</p>

          <p>A contractor in Syria uncovered an ancient Byzantine tomb complex while clearing rubble in the town of Maarat al-Numan. The tomb, believed to be over 1,500 years old, contains two burial chambers with six stone tombs each, featuring a cross etched into one stone column. The discovery adds to the rich collection of archeological sites in Idlib, which holds a third of Syria's monuments. Residents hope the find will lead to economic renewal through tourism and fair compensation for property owners affected by the war.</p>

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a visit to the United States this week for a sixth round of ministerial-level talks aimed at securing concessions on tariffs imposed by President Trump. Minister Ryosei Akazawa will meet with U.S. officials after previous discussions failed to find common ground. Japan is urging the Trump administration to remove additional tariffs, which are impacting Japan's export-oriented economy. Tokyo has presented a package of proposals, including cooperation on semiconductors and critical minerals, and streamlined safety rules for foreign-made cars. (not investment advice)</p>
