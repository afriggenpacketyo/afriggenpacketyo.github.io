          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed a 69% sales increase, driven by strong data center performance due to demand for AI GPUs. However, U.S. export controls restricting the sale of its H20 chip have cost the company billions in potential revenue from China, a market Nvidia estimates to be worth $50 billion. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's cloud provider partnerships with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon remain strong, accounting for roughly half of its data center revenue.

          <p>Archaeologists have determined that a 1,500-year-old bucket discovered at Sutton Hoo, a site of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries in England, was used as a cremation vessel. Analysis of the Byzantine Bromeswell bucket revealed cremated human and animal bones, indicating it held the remains of an important person and their grave goods. The bucket, dating back to the 6th century, is decorated with hunting scenes and is believed to have originated from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire, now modern Turkey. Researchers also found an unburned double-sided comb made from antler, suggesting the Anglo-Saxons valued grooming.</p>

          <p>Anthony Edwards, the Minnesota Timberwolves' 23-year-old star, faces scrutiny for not yet reaching the lofty expectations of becoming the NBA's "face." While the Timberwolves fell short of the NBA finals for the second year in a row, they have made back-to-back Western Conference finals and established themselves as perennial contenders. Edwards's dismantling of the Lakers and Mavericks in the playoffs showcased his potential, but the Timberwolves' loss to the Thunder exposed his youth and areas for growth. Despite the disappointing end, Edwards's progress and the Timberwolves' overall success mark a significant achievement for the franchise.</p>
