        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's latest earnings report revealed a 56% surge in quarterly sales to $46.74 billion, driven by robust demand for AI infrastructure, yet its stock fluctuated due to ongoing concerns about its future in the Chinese market. CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about the "AI revolution" and projected massive infrastructure spending, potentially reaching $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the decade's end. However, the company faces significant geopolitical hurdles, including a Trump administration block on its H20 chip sales to China and an unfinalized deal to restart sales, leaving billions in potential revenue uncertain. Analysts acknowledge solid growth but note the persistent "noise" surrounding China's impact on Nvidia's outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Best Buy reported stronger-than-expected revenue and earnings for its recent quarter, with sales recovering modestly due to strong customer response to sales events and innovation in categories like computing and gaming. The retailer saw its highest comparable sales growth in three years, partly fueled by the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. Despite this positive momentum, Best Buy maintained its full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. The article notes the company is navigating a challenging environment marked by higher interest rates affecting big-ticket purchases and a need to spur growth in slower categories.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBC is strategically scheduling special airings of "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" after four "Sunday Night Football" games this fall, including two featuring the Kansas City Chiefs, to attract new viewers. This move comes as late-night television faces a crisis of declining ratings and revenue, exemplified by CBS's cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." NBC aims to capitalize on "Sunday Night Football's" strong viewership, which averaged 21.6 million last season, making it the most-watched prime-time series for 14 consecutive years. The article suggests this initiative presents an opportunity for "Tonight" to gain audience share, especially with Colbert's impending departure.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce has brought attention to her large, old mine brilliant cut diamond ring, designed by Kindred Lubeck. Experts estimate the ring's value at hundreds of thousands of dollars and expect it to spark new jewelry trends, particularly for elongated and antique cuts. However, finding comparable old mine diamonds may be challenging due to their rarity and cost, especially for natural stones. The article notes that while lab-grown diamonds offer a more affordable alternative, couples inspired by Swift's style can explore less expensive gemstones or vintage markets. The average engagement ring cost is $5,200, emphasizing budget and the "four C's" when shopping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Martin Rafferty, a musician from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing for 24 hours straight. Despite breaking his thumb last week and battling cold temperatures, Rafferty persevered, ending his set at 15:00 BST due to his injury and fading voice. He had initially planned to play for 30 hours. The feat was undertaken to raise money for a local Christmas toy appeal, demonstrating his dedication to both music and community. Rafferty's achievement required adherence to specific rules, including not repeating songs within four hours and a 30-second break between each performance.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers are actively participating in the decennial New York City Trees Count, a census of the urban forest that involves volunteers quantifying and classifying park trees. This effort builds on previous censuses, which have evolved to include an app-supported interactive database of street and park trees. While Lidar technology will map street trees, human volunteers are crucial for assessing the health and diversity of 150,000 landscaped park trees. The data collected will inform city initiatives, such as increasing canopy cover and mitigating "heat burden" in underserved neighborhoods. The article highlights the census's role in fostering community engagement and tracking progress in expanding tree diversity and resilience against environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate convicted in 1992 for murder, has been granted a new trial by a federal judge after 31 years, following new forensic tests. DNA evidence from the victim's body now links her neighbor, who is currently incarcerated for an unrelated murder, to the crime. Barbour's confession, a key part of the original case, is now challenged by his claims of police coercion and the new DNA findings, which an earlier forensics report had excluded him from. Chief U.S. District Judge Emily C. Marks ruled that prosecutors violated Barbour's constitutional rights by withholding crucial exculpatory evidence. The state plans to appeal the decision, but Barbour will now have the opportunity to argue his innocence to a jury.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3.3% annualized rate in the second quarter, a higher figure than initially estimated, demonstrating resilience against tariff volatility. This upward revision in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was primarily driven by stronger consumer spending and business activity. Notably, "final sales to private domestic purchasers," a key indicator for Federal Reserve officials, also saw a significant jump. The article highlights the unusual impact of tariffs, with a sharp decline in imports boosting the GDP figure, and notes that for the first half of the year, growth averaged around 2.1%. Experts suggest the economy is likely to continue at a slower, but stable, pace going forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article argues that the Trump administration should prioritize diplomatic efforts over unilateral military force in its war on drugs, particularly concerning Mexican cartels. While the administration has reportedly considered military action, the piece suggests that ongoing cooperation with Mexico, including extraditions and joint surveillance, has yielded results with less diplomatic cost. The article cautions against the historical ineffectiveness of supply-side strategies, especially for synthetic drugs like fentanyl, which are difficult to interdict due to their production methods. Instead, it advocates for focusing on demand reduction and harm reduction programs, citing encouraging signs of declining overdose deaths in the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is shrinking, with nearly half of FDIC-insured banks disappearing since 2005 due to a merger spree by large institutions, leading to concerns about market domination. In contrast, Canada's banking system, with only 79 banks, is highly concentrated but was named the soundest in the world during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts suggest Canada's stability stems from the collective economic strength of its large players. However, former FDIC chair Sheila Bair cautions that market domination can stifle competition, innovation, and lead to less favorable pricing. The article notes the Federal Reserve's proposal to lower capital requirements for big banks in the US could further accelerate consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jay Roach's "The Roses," a remake of "The War of the Roses," stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as a couple whose marriage devolves into a brutal battle over their mansion.
