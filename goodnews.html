          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group experienced a significant increase after the Senate approved the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin legislation. The bill, which seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, has now moved to the House of Representatives. Circle's stock has risen dramatically since its initial public offering on June 5, driven by growing investor interest in stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar, and are gaining traction among banks and payment firms due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The band Haim's new album, "I Quit," explores themes of unraveling commitments and breakups, tailored for a generation wary of marriage. The album is influenced by Fleetwood Mac and Heart, but with a more nonchalant approach. The sisters were each single while recording, and the album title conveys liberation, suggesting that an exit can also be an entrance. The music is described as unshackled, with songs delving into post-breakup grief, anger, and horniness, while also capturing the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he does not anticipate tariffs significantly boosting inflation. Waller stated that the Fed should move slowly but begin easing to avoid potential labor market slowdown. His comments came after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to hold interest rates steady for the fourth consecutive time. While the FOMC voted unanimously to hold rates, individual expectations for future rates are dispersed, reflecting uncertainty among policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Jama Pediatrics indicates that stricter state gun control laws are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children aged up to 17. The research divided states into categories based on the strength of their gun control measures and analyzed pediatric firearm death rates over a 12-year period. States with more permissive gun laws saw a notable increase in children's deaths from gun violence, while states with stricter laws experienced stagnant or declining rates. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures such as universal background checks and safe-storage regulations to protect children.</p>

With the help of his Iranian guide, Reza, Alexander navigated through heavy traffic and military checkpoints to reach the border with Azerbaijan.

          <p>The UK Parliament has recently seen two decisions that signal a significant socially liberal shift. Members of Parliament voted to change abortion legislation, aiming to prevent the prosecution of women in England and Wales for ending their pregnancies. Additionally, the House of Commons backed a change in the law to allow assisted dying, a move likened to historical social changes such as the Abortion Act of 1967 and the decriminalization of homosexuality. While the assisted dying vote still needs approval from the House of Lords, it is now considered likely to pass.</p>
