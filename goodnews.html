          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson purchased the Maryland Colts horse racing franchise in 2024, aiming to win a championship both in the National Football League and the National Thoroughbred League (NTL). Jackson emphasizes the importance of meaningful investments with long-term goals, and hopes to bring new opportunities to the young people of Baltimore. The Maryland Colts are part of the 10-franchise NTL, which uses a team-based concept where points are earned based on the performance of horses and jockeys, similar to auto racing, with points totaled to determine the NTL Championship winner.</p>

The trip included an extraordinary meeting with Syria‚Äôs new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy and lifting sanctions on Syria to offer economic relief. The White House touted deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets, although some agreements were already in progress. While largely sidestepping the conflict in Gaza, Trump acknowledged civilian suffering and expressed a desire for resolution.</p>

          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest is being held in Basel, Switzerland, with the theme "Welcome Home," commemorating the first contest held there in 1956. The UK's entry is Remember Monday, a country-pop trio performing "What The Hell Just Happened." The contest faces controversy over Israel's participation, with over 70 former contestants demanding KAN be banned, alleging complicity in the situation in Gaza. Switzerland is hosting after Nemo's 2024 win, though Nemo criticized the contest's support for artists.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent UK political polls indicate a significant decline in Labour's support since their landslide victory last summer, with Reform briefly holding the voting intention lead in February. Support for Reform has grown across all demographic groups, especially among the young, while the Conservatives maintain robust support with pensioners, though Farage's influence is tightening in this group as well. Prime Minister Starmer's approval ratings have declined sharply, with Reform leading in the Midlands and the South outside of London. Pollsters are using MRPs to predict constituency-level races, combining mega-polls with local population data.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Republican tax bill proposes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, framed as a "bonus" aimed at helping retirees keep more money. This provision is an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a concept previously touted by President Trump. The deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes over $150,000. While this deduction would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is not as generous as a tax credit.</p>
