          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 32C in central England, potentially climbing to 34C on Saturday. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of pressures on health and social care services. Many regions are expected to meet heatwave criteria, sustaining temperature thresholds for three consecutive days. This heatwave is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing hot weather from Western Europe, with France and Spain also expecting temperatures near 40C. Wildfires have surged, increasing 717% compared to last year, prompting concerns from the National Fire Chiefs Council, as scientists link climate change to hotter, longer heatwaves. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, examines the difficulties of family caregiving in the United States, where resources and support are often lacking. The film traces the history of care in America, revealing how it has shifted between being a public concern and a private matter. Medicare does not cover the cost of nursing homes or home care, leaving caregivers to spend thousands of dollars out of pocket each year. The documentary also explores the failures of past legislation to address long-term care needs, while noting recent proposals for tax credits for family caregivers. The documentary highlights the need for greater public support and policy changes to address the growing caregiving crisis.</p>

          <p>The BBC is threatening legal action against AI firm Perplexity, alleging that its chatbot is reproducing BBC content verbatim without permission, which constitutes copyright infringement and breaches the BBC's terms of use.

The BBC argues that this damages its reputation and undermines trust, especially among UK license fee payers.

          <p>China's Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily, cautioned against the growing "addiction" to blind boxes and card packs among the country's youth. The report called for strict identity verification to curb the "out-of-control consumption" of these items by minors. Blind boxes, which contain randomly chosen toys or models, are popular among young consumers but can lead to impulsive spending. This warning echoes previous regulations aimed at preventing online gaming addiction among teenagers, reflecting concerns about the impact of the "guzi economy" on younger generations.</p>

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts after recent destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery, prioritize residents' return, and use tax-increment financing to guide rebuilding in affected neighborhoods. The commission also recommends a ballot measure for a new Fire Control District to focus on wildfire prevention and vegetation management.
