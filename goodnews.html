          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its financial forecast for the year, citing increased sales to home improvement professionals as a buffer against weaker demand from do-it-yourself customers, with CEO Marvin Ellison highlighting investments in stores, technology, and customer service as key factors in navigating market challenges. The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, although sales fell slightly short of Wall Street projections, and while weather impacted sales, online sales and professional sales experienced growth. Lowe's is also strategically acquiring companies like Artisan Design Group to further boost its appeal to professional clients, mirroring Home Depot's efforts to attract this demographic to offset slower sales from individual consumers.</p>

          <p>Patrons of the Boston bar that inspired the sitcom 'Cheers' are mourning the death of George Wendt, the actor who played Norm, a beloved regular at the bar. The bar, formerly known as the Bull & Finch Pub, became a gathering spot for fans to pay their respects, with many toasting to Wendt's memory. Joyce Kulhawik, a WBZ-TV entertainment anchor, recalled Wendt's laid-back and warm personality, noting his resemblance to the character he portrayed. Wendt's death occurred 32 years to the day after the 'Cheers' series finale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK health officials have confirmed the first-ever detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, with the UK Health Security Agency stating the risk to the public is "very low" and that there is no evidence of spread. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023, and health officials emphasize that the detection was not unexpected given the virus's prevalence in Europe. Experts suggest climate change is a contributing factor, potentially introducing non-native mosquito species and infectious diseases to the UK, so authorities are monitoring the situation. While most infections result in minor or no symptoms, a small percentage of infected individuals may experience severe illness, though no specific treatments or vaccines are available for humans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is facing renewed challenges due to volatile lumber prices, which are impacting builders and potentially worsening the affordability crisis, and softwood lumber prices have surged, affecting major homebuilders like Lennar and D.R.

Concerns about increased U.S. duties on Canadian lumber imports, which currently stand at 14.5%, are exacerbating the issue, with potential increases to 34.5% disrupting the sector, and the Trump administration is considering tightening trade restrictions.

          <p>The number of foreign visitors to Japan in April reached a single-month record of 3.91 million, driven by the weak yen and high travel demand during the cherry blossom season and Easter holidays, and foreign arrivals surged 28.5 percent from a year earlier, surpassing the previous record of 3.78 million in January. Japan received some 14.45 million foreign arrivals from January to April, exceeding the 11.60 million recorded in the same period in 2024, and inbound tourists from Canada and Britain hit record monthly highs.</p>
