          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 17:32:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares experienced a notable decline in extended trading after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily attributing the weaker-than-expected results to an ongoing tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. The streamer cited a specific expense stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, an impact not previously included in its financial forecast. Despite this setback, Netflix's overall revenue for the third quarter rose 17%, aligning with analyst expectations, boosted by strong membership growth, strategic pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. The company maintains an optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, projecting another 17% rise in revenue as these positive trends are expected to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The current surge in artificial intelligence investments and soaring valuations has ignited a widespread debate among experts and CEOs on whether the market is experiencing an economic bubble. While some, like former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, contend it is already a bubble but predict it will last several years, others, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, view it as a necessary and well-spent investment for the U.S. to maintain global AI leadership. Concerns raised by figures like former Biden CEA chairman Jared Bernstein include the vast divergence between current investment levels and credibly plausible future earnings, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble. This article synthesizes these diverse perspectives, exploring the sustainability and underlying economics of the rapidly expanding AI sector and its potential long-term implications.

          <p>Netflix reported a 17% jump in third-quarter revenue to $11.5 billion, significantly powered by the success of its animated film, "KPop Demon Hunters," which garnered over 325 million views. Despite this revenue growth, the company's net income of $2.5 billion fell below analyst projections due to a $619 million expense from a Brazilian tax dispute. Netflix also announced a licensing deal with Hasbro and Mattel for "KPop Demon Hunters" merchandise, further capitalizing on the film's popularity. This article highlights the strategic importance of hit content and diversified business models, like merchandising and theatrical re-releases, in the competitive streaming landscape.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing issue of software-dependent cars, particularly electric vehicles, potentially becoming obsolete due to outdated technology rather than mechanical failure. Unlike traditional cars, modern vehicles receive over-the-air updates, but older hardware may not support future AI and autonomous features, akin to an old iPhone struggling with new operating systems. While automakers like Rivian aim for 7-10 years of updateability, the disparity between car and tech lifespans poses a challenge. This article highlights the concern that as cars become "smartphones on wheels," their longevity, a key advantage of EVs, could be compromised by software limitations.</p>

          <p>The price of silver has recently experienced a noticeable drop of approximately 9% this week, potentially presenting a strategic buying opportunity for investors, particularly given its significant 76% year-to-date growth in 2025.

Silver is also highlighted as a comparatively cheaper alternative to gold, offering similar inflation-hedging and portfolio diversification benefits, which remain crucial amidst ongoing economic uncertainties, including the government shutdown.
