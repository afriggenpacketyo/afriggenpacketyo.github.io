          <p>At the WWE Crown Jewel event in Perth, Australia, wrestling legends John Cena and AJ Styles competed in what was likely their final match against each other. The contest was a celebrated display of professional wrestling, featuring a wide array of signature moves and dramatic near-falls that captivated the audience. Ultimately, Cena secured the victory after executing a Tombstone Piledriver followed by an Attitude Adjustment. The event also saw Seth Rollins defeat Cody Rhodes, and Stephanie Vaquer win the women's Crown Jewel Championship.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team maintained their undefeated record in the World Cup with an 89-run victory against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a magnificent 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings, guiding England to a total of 253-9. In response, Sri Lanka's batting lineup faltered against Sophie Ecclestone's exceptional bowling, which yielded four wickets for just 17 runs. The win places England at the top of the tournament table ahead of their next match against Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London in April 2024, has been retired to a sanctuary in the countryside. The 15-year-old horse sustained significant injuries after being spooked by construction noise, an incident that also injured five soldiers and four civilians. Due to the severity of his injuries, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, a decision made for his long-term welfare.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scottish National Party (SNP) members have officially backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to pursue a second independence referendum. The plan, endorsed at the party conference in Aberdeen, states that winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election will constitute a mandate to negotiate for another vote on independence. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. An alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum by winning over 50% of the popular vote was rejected by the party leadership.</p>

          <h2>Younger Consumers Increasingly Reject "Fast Furniture" in Favor of Secondhand Goods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 12:46:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, often referred to as Gen Z, are pushing back against the trend of "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items not built to last. Motivated by environmental concerns over the massive amount of furniture waste and a desire for unique items with history, they are turning to secondhand marketplaces. This shift challenges a market driven by rapidly changing seasonal trends, similar to fast fashion, which has led to millions of tons of furniture being discarded annually. The trend reflects a broader desire for sustainability, affordability, and a personal connection to home furnishings.</p>

Her campaign focuses on ushering in a "new era" for the nation, addressing issues like the Anglophone crisis and youth unemployment.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held what was described as a "very productive" phone call to discuss a potential peace process for Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Trump to apply his diplomatic efforts, similar to those in the Middle East, to help end the war with Russia. The conversation also covered Ukraine's need for enhanced air defense capabilities following recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, with Zelenskyy noting Trump's willingness to provide support. This call signals a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a publicly contentious meeting earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are highlighting President Donald Trump's role as a critical factor in brokering the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which aims to end the war in Gaza. According to reporting from a "Washington Week" panel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long prided himself on understanding American politics, likely yielded to U.S. pressure due to his fundamental need for American support. This perspective suggests that as American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, direct pressure from the U.S. president became a decisive element in bringing the parties to an agreement.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock's Jay Jacobs, a significant trend in 2025 sees investors moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds and into more targeted, thematic ETFs focused on artificial intelligence and blockchain.

Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI). Similarly, enthusiasm for blockchain technology, particularly surrounding Ethereum, is driving interest in cryptocurrency-related ETFs, a trend further supported by new stablecoin legislation signed into law.

This acquisition is part of Lowe's "Total Home" strategy to better serve large professional customers in a market valued at $250 billion. The deal comes as Lowe's faces challenges with declining customer transactions and a pullback from Pro customers on large projects due to the uncertain housing market.

Some, like filmmaker Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas and Los Angeles's Vidiots, operate as non-profits, relying on donations and special events to survive. Others, such as New York's Metrograph, have found success as for-profit ventures by offering a premium experience with a restaurant, bookstore, and curated programming.
