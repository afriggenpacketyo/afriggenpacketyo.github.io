          <h2>Florida to Receive Federal Funding for Immigration Detention Centers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal government will fund Florida's construction of immigration detention centers, including a proposed Everglades site dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. FEMA's shelter and services program, designed to aid cities receiving migrants, will largely finance the effort. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that the "Alligator Alcatraz" airfield would house immigrants with criminal records, deterring escape with surrounding wetlands. This initiative reflects a broader Republican-led state effort to support the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, with states like Texas deputizing National Guard troops as immigration officers. The collaboration aims to enhance border security and address illegal immigration issues. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak." Diplomatic sources indicate the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing over the weekend. The move echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq, where advance notice was given to minimize casualties. Trump said the strikes caused minimal damage and urged Iran and Israel to pursue peace, suggesting a potential de-escalation of the conflict. </p>

          <p>While President Trump claims the U.S. military operation against Iran resulted in the complete obliteration of Tehran's nuclear capabilities, the reality is more complex. Experts suggest Iran's nuclear capacities have been significantly set back, but the atomic standoff is far from over. There are differing accounts about the fate of Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles, and Iranian leaders have not signaled a willingness to surrender the nuclear program. Trump has shown little tolerance for criticism of the operation, preferring to view it as a black-and-white success. Although Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. air base in Qatar, Trump announced a ceasefire agreement, suggesting a winding down of military confrontation. </p>

Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers reluctant to buy other energy products. (not investment advice) </p>

Some voters believe the strikes were preventative, not provocative, and defended Trump's decision to proceed without congressional approval. While some expressed disappointment, others saw it as putting military interests first. Overall, Trump's supporters trusted his judgment and access to national security intelligence. </p>

Trump warned of an overwhelming American response to any Iranian attacks, but seems inclined to hold his fire if the damage is limited and no additional attacks occur. If the ceasefire holds, Trump's high-risk maneuver may be paying off, as he seems to be hoping that the Iranians will be willing to negotiate in earnest.

          <p>Before missions that can stretch beyond 40 hours, pilots of the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber undergo weeks of preparation focused on flight plans and nutrition. Pilots are trained to be cognizant of foods and how they slow or speed digestion, critical in an aircraft with a single chemical toilet. Retired Lt. Gen. Steve Basham's go-to meal is turkey sandwiches on wheat bread, no cheese. With its stealth profile, the B-2 can fly 6,000 nautical miles without refueling, but most missions require multiple mid-air refuelings, a process that becomes increasingly difficult as fatigue sets in. </p>

          <p>Meta reportedly approached artificial intelligence startup Runway, known for its AI video-generation tools, about a potential takeover before investing in Scale AI. The deal talks between Meta and Runway did not progress far and ultimately dissolved, according to a source familiar with the matter. Runway, which earned a spot on CNBC's Disruptor 50 list earlier this month, is known for its video generation technology. Meta declined to comment on the report. </p>
