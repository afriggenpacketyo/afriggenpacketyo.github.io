          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending rising tensions since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to Pakistan's Foreign Minister Dar and confirmed by Indian officials. President Trump announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, stating it was achieved after talks mediated by the United States, with Secretary of State Rubio confirming that Vice President Vance and he conversed with officials from both countries to broker the agreement. Earlier, Indian officials accused Pakistan of attacking 26 locations across India and moving troops into forward areas, while Pakistan denied involvement in the April attack and claimed retaliatory strikes on India and Indian-controlled Kashmir. The article provides context on the escalating tensions and the diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after a failed mission to Venus. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, with the European Space Agency's space debris office also noting its demise. It was unclear where the spacecraft landed or how much of it survived, though some experts believed parts could withstand reentry. Scientists stated the chances of anyone being hit by debris were low, and the U.S. Space Command was still analyzing data to confirm the spacecraft's demise. The article highlights the uncontrolled nature of the reentry and the routine monitoring of such events.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered military leaders and commanders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) that promote "divisive concepts and gender ideology" deemed incompatible with the department's mission. Leaders have until May 21 to remove the books, following a similar order given to military academies, which removed nearly 400 books. The department said a temporary committee will help remove similar books, using search terms like "affirmative action" and "critical race theory." This move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to purge DEI from the federal government.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman is urging Americans to increase their financial literacy and advocating for better financial education in the U.S., citing the lack of a strong tradition of encouraging smart personal finance. He expresses concern over the current generation of young investors being drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and the complexity of consumer finance created by corporate America. Edelman cautions young investors to seek information from credible sources and highlights the lack of mandatory personal finance courses in high schools. Despite these challenges, he notes that younger Americans are highly motivated to achieve financial success, driven by observing their parents' inadequate retirement planning.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Nichols of England and Wales described the experience of being sealed off in the conclave to choose the new Pope Leo XIV as "immensely peaceful." He said there was no rancor or politicking among the cardinals, adding that it was a calmer process than expected. Cardinal Nichols also noted that being without his mobile phone allowed him more time for prayer and reflection, and that everyone involved was peaceful and wanted to do the process well.</p>

          <p>The Langenhop family faced a challenging situation when their three children were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare genetic disorder. The children participated in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals, which involved using a patient's own stem cells. All nine patients in the trial, including the Langenhop children, produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections. Five years later, the Langenhop children are doing well, and the therapy is under review with the Food and Drug Administration, offering hope for future patients.</p>
