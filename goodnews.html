          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after being bitten on her leg and foot while swimming at Jones Beach, New York. State officials believe the bite was most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark, based on analysis of the wounds. The woman was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and she did not see the creature that bit her. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended while authorities conducted drone searches, but normal beach activities resumed the next day.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected another attempt by former President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated "Central Park Five" dismissed. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit was filed by the five men, who were wrongfully convicted as teenagers, over statements Trump made during a 2024 presidential debate. They allege Trump defamed them by falsely claiming they had pled guilty and killed someone.</p>

As lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit, their legal battle, though initially unsuccessful in court, helped build momentum and public awareness that contributed to Maryland legalizing same-sex marriage in 2012. They shared their story of overcoming obstacles and expressed concern over current efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, emphasizing the importance of their fight for their family and community.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has successfully invented a specialized printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine capable of handling plastic labels that commercial printers could not. The students designed the printer to be user-friendly for employees with low or no vision. The device has already been used to produce 400 labels for a special "Blind Spot" beer, supporting a fundraiser for individuals with vision loss.</p>

          <p>Wall Street concluded a volatile week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new record highs, a surprising outcome given the initial market anxiety over U.S. strikes on Iran. After an initial surge, energy prices fell sharply, which investors interpreted as a sign that the conflict would not systemically impact economic growth or inflation. This sentiment, combined with renewed investor hopes for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end, fueled the market rally. The week demonstrated the market's ability to look past geopolitical turmoil when immediate economic threats appear contained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New genetic research on skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. By analyzing DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses, scientists found that where biological connections existed, they were traced through the female line. This indicates that women likely remained in their family homes after marriage while men moved in. The findings, published in the journal Science, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

A concerned driver reported the sighting, prompting an officer to investigate the remote stretch of Highway 166. Instead of a stranded tiger cub, the officer found a dead hawk. It remains unclear how the driver mistook the bird for a large feline. The incident served as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California for private individuals.</p>
