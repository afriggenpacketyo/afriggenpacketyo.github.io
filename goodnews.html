          <p>Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett continues to advocate for the public release of Department of Justice files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. While speaking on Sunday, he emphasized the need for transparency but also cautioned against exposing the identities of victims or innocent individuals mentioned in the documents. Burchett pushed back against President Trump's recent characterization of the demands as "foolish," stating he was "a little ticked off" but undeterred. He views the President's subsequent directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal grand jury evidence as a positive first step.</p>

          <p>The latest broadcast of "CBS News Sunday Morning" covered a diverse range of topics, led by a feature on the science of personality change, as detailed in Olga Khazan's book "Me, But Better." The episode also included a report from Naples, Italy, examining the lives of residents living within the volcanic "red zone" of Campi Flegrei amid increasing seismic activity. Other segments explored a little-known Civil War landmark in Washington D.C. where Clara Barton located missing soldiers, and profiled the career of 98-year-old conductor Herbert Blomstedt. The program offered a mix of science, history, and cultural profiles.</p>

          <h2>The Atlantic Features Jodie Hollander's Poem "Your Horses"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a poem titled "Your Horses," published by The Atlantic, poet Jodie Hollander reflects on the work of Ted Hughes. The piece evokes a stark, moody landscape on the moors, where the speaker envisions the powerful, silent, and enduring presence of horses that Hughes once described. The poem contrasts this peaceful, elemental scene with the chaos of public life, questioning whether such tranquility was ever found again. It concludes with a poignant image of a continued, restless search for that profound moment of connection with nature.</p>

          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030. This pledge comes after Environment Agency data showed serious pollution incidents in England rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high, sparking public outrage. Reed acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that regulators like Ofwat are "clearly failing," suggesting regulatory changes are necessary. The plan is part of a wider effort to improve the water sector, funded by a record £104 billion investment that will lead to higher consumer bills.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. She argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem later in life. Raouda advises parents to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. Fostering this skill builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, serving as a protective buffer for mental health.</p>

Local business owners and residents are banding together to capitalize on the centennial, aiming to transform their "ghost town" atmosphere into a go-to destination for nostalgic travelers.

          <p>In her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her historic career and the challenges of racism and sexism in politics. She recounts a notable incident with Senator Jesse Helms and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in the U.S. Looking at the current political landscape, Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party seems to be "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to counter Donald Trump. Despite recent political setbacks, she remains optimistic about the resilience of American democracy.</p>
