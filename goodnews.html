The AI-automated arm acts as a third hand, controlled from a console where surgeons view live endoscopic footage, and helps with tissue retraction, gauze handling, and blood vessel clipping. The researchers published their work in Science Robotics, highlighting the growing clinical demand and strain on surgeons due to an aging population.
