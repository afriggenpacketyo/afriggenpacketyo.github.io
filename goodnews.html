        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the "sell U.S." narrative strengthens, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has highlighted emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 8.55% year-to-date, compared to a 1% climb by the S&P 500, reflecting a growing confidence in emerging markets assets.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are calling on the EU to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air, over their baggage fees. The groups accuse the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" at check-ins by charging additional fees for hand baggage that does not meet their guidelines. They are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the "illegal" practices, and advocating for a standard luggage allowance to be included in ticket purchases. </p>
