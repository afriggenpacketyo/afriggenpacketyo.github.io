          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act for allegedly assisting Iran between August 2024 and February 2025. The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command led the investigation, describing it as complex and fast-moving. The men were arrested on May 3 and have been remanded in custody, scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court. This case highlights ongoing concerns about foreign interference and the UK's efforts to counter such activities through its national security legislation.</p>

The Knicks dominated the game, especially in the second quarter, and will now face the Indiana Pacers in a seven-game series for a spot in the NBA finals. The Celtics, who were without Jayson Tatum due to a ruptured Achilles tendon, struggled to keep pace with the Knicks' offensive firepower.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study published in Science traces the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, helping underrepresented Indigenous groups understand their ancestral origins. Researchers found that early settlers split into groups isolated by environmental barriers like the Amazon rainforest and Andes mountain range. The findings provide crucial insights into the history, migration, and adaptation of Indigenous communities and highlight the importance of preserving their cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expressed their frustration during the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, with Lowry lashing out at the course after being denied relief for an embedded ball, resulting in a bogey five. Hatton also swore at his driver after a poor tee shot, leading to a costly triple bogey. Both golfers are likely to face fines for their behavior, which underscores the pressure and emotions involved in high-stakes golf tournaments, where even seasoned professionals can struggle to maintain composure.</p>

The flags of Haiti and St. Lucia were displayed at the forum, while those of Guatemala and Belize, also Celac members with ties to Taiwan, were not.

The event was described as "something out of the history books" by residents, highlighting the unusual and disruptive nature of the weather phenomenon.

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethical questions. In Saudi Arabia, he announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria and received a standing ovation, while in Qatar and the UAE, he secured investment pledges and was awarded the country's highest civilian honor. The trip underscored Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy and the warm reception he receives in the Gulf, where leaders prioritize business deals over human rights concerns.</p>
