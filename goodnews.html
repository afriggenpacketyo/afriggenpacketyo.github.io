        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration may link Tylenol to rising autism rates, scientific experts are pushing back, stating the evidence is not tenable. Researchers emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic links, and it is unrealistic to attribute it to a single medication. The increase in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to broader diagnostic criteria, greater awareness, and improved screening methods. The scientific community continues to affirm that there is no causal link between vaccines and autism, a claim that has been thoroughly debunked.</p>

          <p>At his party's autumn conference, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey stated his party has a "moral duty" to defeat Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. Acknowledging that some voters are drawn to Reform, Davey positioned the Lib Dems as an alternative offering change consistent with British values, contrasting it with what he called Farage's "Trump's America" vision. He addressed voter concerns about immigration by proposing measures to clear the asylum backlog and also highlighted policies to tackle the cost of living.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has made a case for a significant cut to the central bank's benchmark interest rate, arguing it is currently too high. In a speech, Miran contended that policy changes related to taxes, immigration, and deregulation have created a new economic landscape that warrants lowering the rate by nearly two percentage points. He believes that maintaining the current restrictive policy poses significant risks to the Fed's employment mandate. This stance places him outside the consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, which favors a more cautious approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, proposing a new U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American board members and investors. Under this structure, tech company Oracle would manage all U.S. security operations from "top to bottom," including the content recommendation algorithm. A senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal's framework, which would not involve the U.S. government taking an equity stake. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order backing the proposal and extending the ban deadline.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian activist who has been imprisoned for most of the last decade. Abdel-Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, had become one of the country's most prominent political prisoners. The pardon, which also included five other individuals, follows repeated calls for his release from the United Nations and the British government. The decision came shortly after a Cairo court removed him from the country's terrorism list, citing a lack of evidence.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance daily independence. Users can connect the glasses to the "Be My Eyes" app, which links them with volunteers for real-time assistance with tasks like reading mail or navigating stores. The glasses also feature optical character recognition (OCR) to read text aloud from menus and signs. While advocates like the National Federation of the Blind note the technology is still a work in progress, they praise Meta for collaborating with the community to improve its utility.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest level in nearly three years. For borrowers with large loans, this translates to significant savings. For example, the monthly principal and interest payment on a $1 million mortgage is now approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the rates available in January 2025. This reduction in borrowing costs enhances affordability for homebuyers and presents potential refinancing opportunities for current homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Telo, the company developing the compact MT1 electric truck, has clarified why it will not offer a gasoline-powered range extender or a hybrid version of its vehicle. In a video, the company explained that its core mission is to "shrink the mobility footprint," and adding an internal combustion engine would compromise the truck's unique, compact design. An engine would add weight, take up valuable space intended for features like a lockable cargo tunnel, and complicate the vehicle's structure. Telo is focusing on creating a specialized vehicle for urban environments rather than aiming for mass-market appeal.</p>

This move is seen as part of a broader trend where caution and physicality are returning to prominence over the progressive, passing-heavy approach that has dominated for years.
