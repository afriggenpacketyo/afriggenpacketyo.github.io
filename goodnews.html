          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 06:36:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a four-day strike, NJ Transit engineers approved a new deal, bringing relief to commuters who rely on the system to reach New York City and Philadelphia. While the strike is over, train service will not resume until Tuesday to allow for safety checks and equipment repositioning. NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri noted the deal is fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting concessions made through a work rule agreement. During the strike, commuters faced crowded buses and PATH trains, with NJ Transit cross-honoring rail tickets on bus and light rail lines. The union argued for higher pay due to the rising cost of living, and the last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in England, Wales, and Scotland are expected to decrease in July, marking the first drop in Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual energy bills will fall by ¬£129 for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. This translates to a typical annual bill of ¬£1,720, down from the current ¬£1,849. Dr. Craig Lowrey of Cornwall Insight acknowledges that while this is a positive step, prices remain significantly higher than historical levels, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability. </p>
