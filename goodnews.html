          <p>Lenders are increasingly offering promotional introductory rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to attract borrowers in the current high-interest climate. While these offers can provide short-term savings with low initial rates, experts urge homeowners to be cautious. It is crucial to understand when the promotional period ends and how significantly the rate will increase afterward, as the fully indexed rate can be much higher. Borrowers should also read the fine print for potential pitfalls like prepayment penalties or early termination fees, ensuring the long-term costs do not outweigh the initial benefits.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the August 12 trade tariff deadline with China will likely be extended following upcoming talks in Stockholm. The two nations had agreed to a 90-day suspension of major tariffs to allow for negotiations. Bessent expressed optimism about the trade relationship, stating it is in a "very good place" and has moved to a more constructive level. He hopes the discussions will also address other key issues, including China's manufacturing surplus, its purchases of sanctioned Russian oil, and its role in the Ukraine war.

          <p>Following Coca-Cola's announcement to offer a cane sugar version of its soda, health experts have clarified that there is little nutritional difference between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. Both sweeteners consist of glucose and fructose and contribute similarly to health issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease when consumed in excess. While corn syrup undergoes more processing and has a slightly higher fructose content, which some experts find concerning for inflammation, both are considered added sugars with empty calories. Dietitians emphasize that moderation is key, as the American Heart Association recommends limiting intake of both.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that he does not believe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell needs to resign, despite recent criticisms of the central bank. Speaking on Fox Business, Bessent stated that while he supports an internal review of the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, he thinks Powell should be allowed to complete his term. This position contrasts with President Trump's calls for Powell to quit and more severe critiques from others. Bessent suggested that leading such a review could positively shape Powell's legacy by "right-sizing" the Fed's expanding operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has refuted media reports claiming that Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF railroad was collaborating with Goldman Sachs on a potential takeover of a competitor. The billionaire investor told CNBC that no one from the investment bank had contacted him or his designated successor, Greg Abel, about any such deal. Buffett reiterated his long-held aversion to using external bankers for deal-making, emphasizing his preference for internal decision-making. The denial came after reports suggested BNSF was exploring a bid for Norfolk Southern in response to a potential move by rival Union Pacific.</p>

This innovative approach comes as national bus passenger volume has fallen to nearly half of its 2019 levels due to the rise of subways and ride-hailing services.

While global business travel is projected to reach a new high of $1.57 trillion in 2025, the growth rate has been revised downward.

The new product is designed to complement the existing portfolio and cater to consumer preferences for alternatives like "Mexican Coke," which already uses cane sugar.

With the U.S. threatening steep tariffs, the EU could pragmatically negotiate with China to gain leverage. The author suggests that for the EU to expect China to pressure Russia over Ukraine, it must reconsider its own alignment with U.S. tech restrictions against Beijing, especially as the U.S. itself relaxes some controls. By re-evaluating its stance, the EU could potentially secure a more favorable outcome in its dealings with both superpowers.</p>
