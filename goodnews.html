          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy announced its intention to take a 5% equity stake in Canadian mining company Lithium Americas and a separate 5% stake in its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This move, part of a broader White House strategy to secure critical mineral supply chains, caused the company's stock to surge over 35% in extended trading. The investment is framed as a commercial transaction to ensure the financial soundness of the project, which is poised to become a major North American source of lithium. The government's direct involvement aims to bolster domestic mining and refining of minerals essential for technologies like electric vehicle batteries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new "K-visa" program designed to attract foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by easing entry requirements and removing the need for employer sponsorship. The policy has triggered significant public backlash on social media, with citizens expressing concerns about increased competition in a strained job market and the potential for fraudulent applications. In response, state media has defended the program, arguing it is a targeted effort to recruit high-level talent crucial for China's technological advancement, not a move toward mass immigration. Analysts expect the visa issuance to be tightly controlled amid the public's concerns.</p>

In his announcement, the Republican candidate stated that the state's current one-party Democratic system has left working people behind and that a new type of public servant is needed. His platform focuses on restoring affordability by lowering taxes, growing the economy, and increasing educational options for parents. Minogue joins a growing field of Republican challengers seeking to unseat incumbent Democratic Governor Maura Healey in the upcoming election.</p>

          <h2>Etymological Roots of the Word 'Hoax' Traced to 17th-Century Magic Trick</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" originates from "hocus pocus," an incantation famously used by a 17th-century English magician named William Vincent. The phrase itself is believed by some to be a satirical corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum," reflecting the anti-Catholic sentiment of the era. Over time, "hocus pocus" became a general term for trickery and was eventually shortened to "hoax" around the early 1800s. The article explores this magical backstory, connecting the term's origin to historical examples of grand deceptions, from fabricated countries to journalistic pranks.</p>

          <p>Point Pleasant, West Virginia, has transformed its local legend of the Mothman—a mysterious winged creature reportedly sighted in 1966—into a major economic driver. The annual Mothman Festival now attracts around 20,000 visitors, injecting millions of dollars into the small town's economy and revitalizing its downtown area. Fans, drawn by books, movies, and video games featuring the cryptid, gather for the event, which includes tours, guest speakers, and cosplay. This phenomenon illustrates how folklore can foster a unique cultural identity and provide a significant economic boost for a community, turning a local mystery into a global attraction.</p>

          <p>New data from the banking trade body UK Finance reveals that 50% of adults in the United Kingdom now regularly use mobile payment services like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This marks a significant shift in consumer behavior, up from 34% in the previous year, with adoption growing across all age groups, not just among younger demographics. The increased convenience of using phones and smartwatches for contactless transactions has led to a slight decline in the use of physical contactless cards. While digital payments are becoming mainstream, campaigners stress the importance of maintaining access to cash for budgeting and for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A resilient brown bear named Chunk has won the 2025 Fat Bear Week, an annual online competition where the public votes for the bear that has best prepared for winter hibernation. Chunk, who weighs over 500kg, gained popularity for his perseverance after breaking his jaw earlier in the summer, an injury that did not stop him from successfully fishing for salmon at Alaska's Katmai National Park. The contest, which draws voters from over 100 countries, highlights the bears' survival strategies and has become a global phenomenon for wildlife education and entertainment.

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football was broken five times in 2025, with top players moving to clubs in England's Women's Super League (WSL) and the US National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). While agents see this as a positive sign of a growing ecosystem, experts warn that the surge in fees could widen the financial gap between the elite leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga. The disparity is fueled by more lucrative broadcast and sponsorship deals in the US and England. This trend risks creating a permanent elite tier of clubs that can afford top talent, potentially harming competitive balance across the global game.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was in line with economists' expectations. The central bank is pausing to evaluate the economic impact of a significant 50-basis-point rate cut made in June, as its effects have not yet fully permeated the economy. While inflation has moderated, the RBI noted that growth could slow in the second half of the fiscal year due to global trade uncertainties, including U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. The government recently cut the goods and services tax on several items to stimulate domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting this week, supermarkets and other large retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products classified as unhealthy. This long-debated measure, previously delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, is part of the government's strategy to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health advocates have welcomed the move, arguing that such deals do not save consumers money and instead encourage impulsive and excessive purchasing of junk food. The ban aims to shift promotional focus towards healthier products, making them more accessible and appealing to shoppers.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte has focused on navigating the alliance's precarious relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump. His primary challenge has been to maintain U.S. commitment to NATO, which involved extensive diplomacy to appease Trump's demands for increased defense spending from member nations. While some critics view his approach as overly deferential, many foreign policy experts credit him with successfully keeping the U.S. engaged and giving European allies much-needed time to bolster their own security capabilities. His leadership is now being tested by more direct external threats from Russia, such as drone incursions.</p>
