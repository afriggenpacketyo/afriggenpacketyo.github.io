          <p>Kyodo News reports that the Japanese government has lodged a strong protest with China over new construction activities in a contested area of the East China Sea. Japan believes China is building a facility for resource development, a move that Tokyo sees as a unilateral advancement while the sea boundary remains undefined. In other news, Japan and the WTO have agreed to strengthen the multilateral trade system amid rising concerns over protectionism. Meanwhile, Hong Kong updated its security law to facilitate investigations by Beijing's national security agency, a move feared to further stifle the pro-democracy movement.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams's use of at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation has raised eyebrows. Adams explained that he used multiple phones for different purposes, including office, personal, and campaign use, and obtained additional phones after federal authorities seized his devices. The FBI tracked his location using cellphone data as part of an investigation that initially led to his indictment on bribery and other charges, which were later dismissed. Adams criticized the tactics used by federal authorities, attributing his inability to remember his phone password to dyslexia and suggesting the seizure of his devices at the marathon was intended to humiliate him.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known as the "world's poorest president" due to his modest lifestyle, has died at the age of 89.

He rejected the presidential residence, opting to live on his farm with his wife, and gave away a large portion of his salary. His legacy is marked by pragmatism, audacity, and a focus on reducing poverty and promoting social justice, though he faced criticism for increased public spending and education challenges.</p>

The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death. It also captures, in real time, the evolution of a bold new identity growing among Latino youth in the 1980s, encapsulated in Los Dinos‚Äô cultural hybridity.</p>

          <p>An artificial intelligence (AI) tool, dubbed "Consult," has been used to sort through public comments about botox and lip fillers in the UK. The tool, designed to streamline public consultations, achieved nearly identical results to human experts. Officials estimate that using such AI tools could save taxpayers ¬£20m.
