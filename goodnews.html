          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, including a weekly studio show dedicated to WNBA coverage. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, reports estimate the original deal's value at $13 million annually, with Ion broadcasting 50 regular-season games this season. The partnership has seen significant growth in viewership, attributed to the league's rising popularity and the emergence of stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. This agreement follows an 11-year media rights deal the WNBA signed with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, valued at approximately $200 million per year, reflecting the increasing value and demand for WNBA content.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Improves as Trump Rolls Back Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 12:40:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, driven by optimism following President Donald Trump's rollback of some tariffs. This resurgence ended six consecutive months of worsening attitudes, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, and comes after the easing of tariffs led to a trade agreement between the U.S. and China, as well as the pausing of "Liberation Day" tariffs. While warning signs of potential future price increases remain, the current economic data suggests a positive shift in consumer confidence, although the long-term impact of trade policies remains uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early June, surpassing expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation eased, according to a University of Michigan survey. The survey indicated across-the-board improvements in consumer attitudes, coinciding with a softening of rhetoric surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs and progress in trade negotiations. Despite the positive shift, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, reflecting ongoing worries about the potential impact of tariffs and other geopolitical concerns. The improvement in consumer sentiment suggests a potential stabilization in economic outlook, although uncertainties persist regarding trade policy and its effects on prices.</p>

          <p>Amazon is reorganizing its health-care business into six new units after a series of executive departures, aiming to simplify its structure and improve the fragmented patient experience.

          <p>Shares of RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) jumped after the luxury furniture retailer maintained its sales forecast and outlined measures to offset higher costs from tariffs. The company expects full-year revenue to grow by 10% to 13% and reported adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents for the fiscal first quarter. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China and delaying the launch of a new concept until 2026. The company's strategic adjustments and international expansion plans, including a store opening in Paris, aim to navigate challenges in the real estate market and trade environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK, causing significant hay fever symptoms for many people. Warm weather conditions have been ideal for birch tree pollen, a major trigger, and recent dry days have helped spread pollen through the air. Allergy experts recommend a "cocktail approach" of antihistamine tablets or drops, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops for relief. Additional measures to reduce symptoms include avoiding triggers, maintaining good hygiene, and regularly cleaning the home.</p>
