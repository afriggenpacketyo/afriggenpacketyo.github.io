          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced a goal to increase Japan's nominal GDP to 1,000 trillion yen (approximately $7 trillion) by 2040. He has instructed ruling party executives to include this target in their pledge for the upcoming nationwide election this summer. This figure represents a substantial increase from the country's 2024 nominal GDP of around 600 trillion yen. The announcement comes as Japan prepares for an election for the House of Councillors, with discussions ongoing regarding tariffs and bond-buying strategies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on ocean bottom trawling across English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2. This proposal aims to safeguard rare marine animals and the seabed, and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where Sir David Attenborough has warned about the destructive impacts of bottom trawling. Pressure is mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty, aiming to protect 30% of international waters by 2030, as President Macron calls for a moratorium on deep sea mining.</p>

          <p>Democrats are showing mixed reactions to President Trump's policy bill, with some expressing support for certain tax cut elements within the legislation. This dynamic is being exploited by Republicans, who are trying to build a case for the enactment of their domestic agenda. The division among Democrats highlights the complexities of bipartisan negotiations and the potential for unexpected alliances on specific policy issues. Republicans are strategically using this support to advance their legislative priorities, potentially reshaping the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Health experts are discussing the importance of magnesium, a mineral involved in over 300 enzyme systems in the body, and whether supplementation is necessary. Magnesium plays a crucial role in energy production, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. Deficiency can lead to various health issues, including insomnia, muscle cramps, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. While dietary sources are preferred, supplements may be recommended in certain cases, with experts cautioning against excessive supplementation (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) among individuals without diabetes has sparked debate about their actual health benefits. While these devices have revolutionized diabetes care, their utility for the general population is less clear. Studies have shown mixed results, with some individuals experiencing significant improvements in weight loss and blood sugar control, while others see little to no benefit. Experts suggest CGMs may be useful for those highly sensitive to carbohydrates, needing extra motivation to eat healthier, or seeking greater dietary awareness, but caution that the data can be confusing and potentially misleading.</p>

          <p>China's car sales experienced a rise in May for the fourth consecutive month, though the pace of growth has slowed. Sales increased by 13.9% year-on-year, reaching 1.96 million vehicles, with electric vehicle and hybrid sales rising by 28.2%. However, slower growth among major automakers has highlighted concerns about aggressive price competition, leading authorities and industry leaders to call for an end to the price wars. Meanwhile, exports rebounded, increasing by 13.5% year-on-year, reversing a decline from the previous month.</p>

There is a critical need for O negative blood, which can be used for most patients, and more black donors are needed to treat sickle cell disease.

          <p>China appears to be offering a reprieve to U.S. and European auto giants amid concerns over a rare earth shortage. China's Ministry of Commerce is willing to establish a "green channel" for eligible export license applications to EU firms. This follows trade talks between Chinese and EU officials, as well as reports that China has granted rare earth licenses to suppliers of U.S. auto giants. These actions suggest a potential easing of trade tensions and a willingness to address supply chain concerns (not investment advice).</p>
