          <p>Chicago Sky's Angel Reese achieved her first career triple-double with 11 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists against the Connecticut Sun.  However, the game was marked by a heated exchange between Reese and Sun's Bria Hartley, involving a shove and allegations of hair-pulling.  Both players received technical fouls.  Reese's team ultimately secured a victory, but the incident highlighted the intensity of the WNBA competition.</p>

          <p>Reports of a family feud between David Beckham's son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz have emerged, potentially impacting the Beckham family's carefully curated public image.  The rumors, fueled by social media speculation, have shifted the narrative from Beckham's recent knighthood and 50th birthday celebrations.  Experts suggest this could damage the family's brand, which has historically relied on controlled messaging and aspirational imagery.  The situation draws parallels to other high-profile family conflicts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's long-awaited military parade in Washington, D.C., celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, proved underwhelming for many.  While the event featured troops, tanks, and aircraft, it lacked the grand spectacle some anticipated.  The parade coincided with other significant events, including protests against Trump's policies and the escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict.  The event's organization also faced criticism due to logistical issues and overflowing crowds.</p>
