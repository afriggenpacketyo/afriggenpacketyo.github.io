          <p>Following the successful completion of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have announced substantial increases to their quarterly dividends. Goldman Sachs raised its payout by 33% to $4 per share, while Wells Fargo boosted its dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents per share, causing both companies' stock prices to rise. The article notes that such dividend hikes are generally seen as a sign of management's confidence in future cash flow and profitability. These banks join a list of other major companies, including Meta and Costco, that have also increased shareholder payouts this year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Corey Parchman has released a new book, "IVF Playbook for Men," to provide a resource for men navigating the challenges of infertility. He and his wife endured five IVF cycles before having their son, a journey that highlighted the lack of support for men, who account for at least 30% of infertility cases. Parchman shares his personal feelings of shock and inadequacy, describing himself as feeling like "the weakest link on the team." The book advocates for open communication, vulnerability, and creating a "safe space" for partners to discuss their emotions during the difficult process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is ramping up a program to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae pose a significant threat to livestock, wildlife, and pets. The strategy involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs subsequently fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This bio-friendly method was successfully used decades ago to eradicate the pest north of Panama and is being revived to counter its recent re-emergence.</p>

          <p>British university student and world number 733, Ollie Tarvet, saw his impressive Wimbledon journey come to an end against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Despite putting up a spirited fight on Centre Court and creating 11 break point opportunities, the 21-year-old qualifier was ultimately defeated in straight sets, 6-1 6-4 6-4. Alcaraz praised his opponent's performance, acknowledging the difficulty of playing a first match on such a prestigious stage. Tarvet's successful run through qualifying and the first round will earn him significant prize money, though NCAA rules limit what he can accept while retaining his student-athlete status.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has launched Gemini Robotics On-Device, a new artificial intelligence system that enables robots to perform complex tasks without needing an internet or cloud connection. This model allows robots to understand natural language and execute fine motor skills locally, making them faster, more reliable, and suitable for environments with poor connectivity. Since the AI runs directly on the robot, data processing remains local, enhancing privacy for sensitive applications in fields like healthcare. Google is making the technology available to select developers to study its real-world applications and safety implications, marking a significant step toward more autonomous and versatile robotics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) system disruptions and a record-breaking travel season, this article explores how pilots and airlines prepare for such events. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle communication loss, with multiple layers of redundant systems in place. These include switching to backup radio frequencies, using a text-based messaging system, and activating a specific transponder code (7600) to signal a communication failure to all nearby aircraft and facilities. Additionally, all airliners are equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously directs planes to avoid mid-air collisions, ensuring passenger safety even if ATC communication is lost.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, as a tangible asset to diversify a portfolio amidst economic uncertainty. It highlights that gold can serve as a hedge against inflation and offers investors direct control over their assets, unlike stocks or bonds. The piece notes the accessibility of purchasing physical gold from various retailers and specialized companies. It also points out that investors can buy fractional gold bars and coins, allowing them to enter the market at a lower price point while still gaining the protective benefits of the precious metal (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The price of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) and stocks of related companies saw a significant increase, driven by renewed enthusiasm for the tokenization of real-world assets. Tokenization, the process of creating digital representations of assets on a blockchain, is a key use case for the Ethereum network. This surge in interest follows Robinhood's announcement of tokenized stock trading in Europe and the launch of BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum platform. Despite a difficult year, this trend highlights the emerging real-world applications for the network beyond just cryptocurrency trading, particularly with stablecoins and other digital assets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of breast cancer in women under 55. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen-only therapy, typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk of breast cancer. This research refines previous understandings of HRT, which were based on older studies of women who began therapy long after menopause. The findings underscore the importance of personalizing treatment based on a woman's individual health profile, including whether she has a uterus, and consulting with a doctor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest version of President Trump's major spending bill includes a provision to increase the investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to build and expand advanced chip fabrication plants in the United States. The move expands upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and aligns with Washington's ongoing efforts to onshore the semiconductor supply chain from Asia and bolster domestic production. Analysts suggest that the threat of Trump's tariff policies, combined with these enhanced tax credits, will likely accelerate the trend of chipmakers investing in U.S.-based facilities.</p>

Farrell lauded Morgan's all-around game and joked that due to his versatility, he could play anywhere in the back row, not just his usual openside flanker position. Morgan himself expressed a desire to be as versatile as possible, acknowledging the fierce competition for spots within the elite touring squad.</p>
