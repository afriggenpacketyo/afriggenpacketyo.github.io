Boeing shares dipped after its CEO indicated delays in 777X certification, which the Club views as a buying opportunity, adding to their position. Broadcom saw a price target increase from Mizuho due to strong AI revenue forecasts, prompting the Club to consider trimming their position to right-size it after a significant rally. Upcoming investor events for DuPont and CrowdStrike are also highlighted as important for monitoring. (not investment advice)</p>

Fable, led by Oculus VR co-founder Edward Saatchi, aims to transform entertainment into a two-way experience, enabling audiences to co-create content. The platform, currently focused on animation due to AI's easier handling compared to photorealistic video, has already produced popular AI-generated South Park episodes.

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage activist to a pivotal figure in the MAGA movement, was a close ally and friend to former President Donald Trump. As co-founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk was instrumental in mobilizing young conservative voters and influencing Trump's campaigns and administration, even vetting appointees. His political views, initially more conventional, shifted rightward over time, embracing Christian nationalism and promoting controversial claims. Kirk's significant influence was recognized by Trump, who credited TPUSA's "ground game" for his 2024 election victory, cementing Kirk's role as a powerful voice in conservative politics.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated a pilot program to expedite the deployment of air taxis, with major eVTOL developers Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation participating. This program, establishing public-private partnerships, aims to promote the safe use of electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, with supervised trials potentially starting next year. This initiative follows President Donald Trump's executive order to foster eVTOL development and is seen as a critical step towards widespread air taxi service in the U.S. Proponents highlight the technology's potential to reduce emissions and alleviate traffic congestion, marking a significant advancement in transportation innovation.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Experience of Panic Attacks Through New Literary Works</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 11:33:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews two new literary works, Michael Clune's novel "Pan" and Lee Lai's graphic novel "Cannon," which vividly portray the debilitating experience of panic attacks. Clune's work describes consciousness vibrating the body, while Lai's uses menacing magpies to symbolize anxiety. "Cannon" follows Lucy, a line cook managing anxiety through exercise and self-help, whose bottled-up fears eventually erupt into a cathartic, destructive rage. Both pieces aim to communicate the internal struggle of panic and the journey towards learning to live with it, offering readers a raw yet ultimately gleeful and insightful perspective on anxiety.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is significantly impacting the apparel industry, creating what resellers call the "Ozempic effect." Stores are noticing a surge in donations of larger sizes and increased demand for smaller clothing, prompting adjustments in inventory and store layouts. While some retailers are reducing extended sizes on racks, experts caution against abandoning the plus-size market, which remains underserved and constitutes a majority of American consumers. The long-term effects on the industry depend on drug accessibility and sustained demand, with drug manufacturers already working to lower prices and expand distribution. (not investment advice)</p>

UK Europe Minister Stephen Doughty hailed the release as a "significant breakthrough," thanking the U.S. for its diplomatic efforts. While this is a positive step, Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya noted that over 1,000 political prisoners remain jailed, and some released individuals faced forced deportation, highlighting ongoing human rights concerns.</p>

Head coach Ruben Amorim emphasized Bayindir's greater experience over Lammens, highlighting the need for a strong and experienced goalkeeper in the current climate. Onana's struggles and subsequent loan spell underscore the immense pressure at the club, making Bayindir's retention a relatively straightforward decision for the manager.</p>
