          <p>Prince Harry undertook a surprise visit to Kyiv, accepting an invitation from Superhumans, an organization dedicated to supporting Ukrainians with life-altering injuries sustained during the war. The Duke of Sussex emphasized his commitment to doing "everything possible" to aid the recovery of injured military personnel and civilians, seeking to humanize their experiences. This marks his first visit to the capital, building on a previous trip to Lviv, and he is joined by a team from his Invictus Games Foundation. The visit highlights continued international solidarity and practical support for Ukraine's recovery efforts amidst the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A unique, publicly funded instrument repair shop serving Los Angeles Unified School District students, which provides free maintenance for thousands of musical instruments, has received a significant $1 million donation from legendary musician and philanthropist Herb Alpert. The facility, crucial for ensuring equitable access to quality instruments for the district's largely low-income student population, gained widespread recognition after being featured in an Oscar-winning documentary. Alpert, a former LAUSD student himself, underscored the vital role music plays in child development and expressed hope that this investment encourages other school districts to support similar programs. This initiative empowers students by removing financial barriers, allowing them to pursue their musical passions.</p>

These advanced chips are critical components for artificial intelligence computing, especially for industry leader Nvidia, a key client. SK Hynix's continued leadership in HBM technology, which boasts doubled bandwidth and 40% increased power efficiency compared to its predecessor, solidifies its position ahead of competitors like Samsung and Micron. The company projects a significant increase in HBM sales for the year, contributing to its substantial market capitalization growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United's women's team encountered an unexpected and bizarre issue before their crucial Champions League qualifier in Norway when several players' boots mysteriously went missing. This forced club officials to hastily purchase 15 pairs of replacement boots and 20 sets of shin guards from a local sports shop, costing nearly £4,000, just hours before kick-off. Despite the last-minute efforts to equip the team, United ultimately lost the first leg 1-0 to SK Brann.
