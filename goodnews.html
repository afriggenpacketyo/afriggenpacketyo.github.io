Ohtani went 1-for-3 with two walks, showing no signs of injury after being hit by a fastball in the previous game. Manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension due to a flare-up in the prior game, while other MLB action saw mixed results for Japanese pitchers, with Tomoyuki Sugano pulled early and Yusei Kikuchi having a no-decision despite a strong outing.

          <p>A Wall Street analyst predicts that XRP and Bitcoin could experience substantial growth, with XRP potentially overtaking Ethereum by 2028 and Bitcoin reaching $710,000 by 2030. The investment thesis for XRP focuses on its ability to facilitate fast and cheap cross-border transactions and the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. Bitcoin's investment thesis centers on its status as digital gold and a hedge against inflation, with a limited supply differentiating it from fiat currencies. Investors should be aware of the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies and avoid relying solely on Wall Street's price targets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The NHS is planning to map the DNA of every newborn baby in England to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to predict and prevent illnesses, enabling personalized healthcare and reducing pressure on NHS services. The program involves sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples to screen for genetic conditions, building on a previous study that tracked the genetic code of up to 100,000 newborns. The health secretary stated that this technology would transform the NHS from a reactive service to one that proactively prevents ill-health, supporting efforts to build a research database of over 500,000 genomes by 2030.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration from Revoking Harvard's International Student Enrollment</h2>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with the school. The injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the federal database used to track student visa applications. Mr. Trump suggested a "mindbogglingly" historic settlement may be reached soon. The administration's actions followed allegations that Harvard failed to address campus antisemitism, prompting a lawsuit from the university.</p>

          <h2>Rhode Island Lawmakers Pass Bill Banning Assault Weapon Sales</h2>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House approved legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly known as assault weapons. The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call the bill the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country." The Supreme Court may soon address the issue nationally.</p>
