          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and more than a dozen other political prisoners after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked Trump for brokering the deal. Lukashenko's spokeswoman said the release was at Trump's request. The released prisoners have been transferred to Lithuania. While this release is a positive step, many political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails.</p>

          <p>The Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham offers a glimpse into the challenges of accessing GP appointments in England, particularly during the '8am scramble.' Receptionists face immense pressure as patients call to secure same-day appointments, which are typically booked within half an hour. The practice has implemented an upgraded phone system, but high demand means some patients inevitably miss out. The Labour government is working to end the early morning phone scramble for appointments, but the situation remains a challenge for both patients and staff. The pressure on primary care continues to rise, as demand has gone up significantly.</p>

          <p>Social media often promotes quick fixes for lowering cortisol levels, but experts warn that these solutions may not address the root causes of stress. Cortisol, a vital hormone, can cause health problems when levels are too high, and social media advice can be misleading. Individuals experiencing burnout may find that social media hacks do not address the underlying issues. Experts recommend mindfulness, therapy, and addressing the causes of stress rather than relying on superficial solutions. The article emphasizes the importance of holistic approaches to stress management.</p>
