          <p>Pro-democracy activist Ted Hui, who fled Hong Kong in 2020 and faces criminal charges related to the 2019 protests, has been granted asylum in Australia. Hui confirmed the decision on social media, expressing gratitude while also conveying the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return home. He is one of several activists targeted by Hong Kong police with bounties for their arrest. In his statement, Hui urged the Australian government to continue advocating for other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned for their pro-democracy activities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on her evolving appreciation for Renaissance art, which she once dismissed as unrelatable. She contrasts her youthful cynicism with her current ability to connect with masterpieces, attributing the change to life experiences like trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The author discusses how a Jenny Saville exhibition, heavily influenced by Renaissance masters, prompted her to consider how art's resonance deepens with age and emotional maturity. Ultimately, she connects the profound empathy found in historical art to contemporary suffering, suggesting that being moved by art is linked to being moved by the pain of others.</p>

          <p>Following three consecutive second-place finishes, Arsenal appears poised to challenge for the Premier League title this season after a £190 million summer spending spree. The club has strengthened its squad with key additions like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres, aiming to increase goal threats and eliminate performance drop-offs. Manager Mikel Arteta has focused on creating a more direct, faster-paced attacking style and has built a team with players entering their peak career years. With heightened expectations from fans and the club, this season is considered a critical test of Arteta's leadership.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf successfully obtained a DNA sample from Bryan Patrick Miller, the "canal killer," during an undercover meeting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. Posing as someone interested in Miller's "Zombie Hunter" persona, the detective arranged the meeting to collect DNA from a water glass, which later matched evidence from the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Despite his initial skepticism that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA provided a definitive link. Miller was subsequently arrested, convicted of both murders, and sentenced to death in June 2023.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, featuring 48 oil paintings and 44 sketches from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery. According to the gallery's deputy director, the exhibition is curated to emphasize Repin's "Russianness," tracing his life and artistic development within the Russian Empire. This focus comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition underscores the cultural and diplomatic ties between China and Russia.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood restaurant that has been a favored haunt for celebrities for decades, has died at age 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Born Dobrivoje Tanasijević, the former professional soccer player opened his classic Italian restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining spot for stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Known for its discreet service and comforting fare, the restaurant became an L.A. institution. Though Tana sold the establishment in 2009, its legacy as a timeless piece of Hollywood history endures under its current ownership.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Cities and States Re-evaluating Decades-Old "85th Percentile" Rule for Setting Speed Limits</h2>

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule," which sets speed limits based on the speed of the fastest drivers, is facing increased scrutiny across the U.S. Critics argue the rule, based on 1930s research, creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas. In response to rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like pedestrian safety should be considered. Some cities are now adopting new models and lowering residential speed limits, though the change is meeting resistance from driver advocacy groups.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop New Technique for Creating Highly Transparent 3D Organ Images</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that produces exceptionally clear and accurate 3D images of organs, including the brain, by making the tissue transparent. The technique creates what is described as an "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. This advancement allows for a more detailed view of the inner workings of biological structures. The scientists also noted that the processed tissues form a stable, glassy solid at low temperatures, enabling long-term storage for future study.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and baserunning mistakes by their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the NL West. The Padres' sloppy play was evident early, with three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. A costly dropped fly ball and multiple walks by Padres pitcher Dylan Cease helped the Dodgers build an insurmountable early lead. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, giving them a crucial tiebreaker advantage.</p>
