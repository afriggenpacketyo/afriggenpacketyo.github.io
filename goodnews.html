          <h2>Kohl's Stock Experiences Volatile Surge Amid Meme Stock Dynamics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 13:31:40 EDT</div>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's experienced a volatile surge of over 30% in Tuesday morning trading, reminiscent of recent meme stock rallies. The stock initially more than doubled from its Monday close before rapidly losing some gains, prompting temporary trading halts. Despite the absence of any specific corporate announcements, Kohl's possesses key characteristics of a meme stock, including significant short interest, estimated at 50% of outstanding shares, and active discussion on online forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Industry analysts, however, caution that this dramatic price movement is driven by "irrational exuberance" rather than improved business fundamentals, as the company continues to grapple with falling sales and leadership transitions.

          <h2>Passenger Recounts Abrupt SkyWest Maneuver to Avoid B-52 Bomber</h2>

          <p>A passenger aboard a SkyWest flight vividly described the moment their plane executed an abrupt turn to avoid a B-52 bomber, likening it to a "sharp turn on a roller coaster." The B-52 was performing a planned flyover for the North Dakota State Fair, which had received FAA approval. However, the SkyWest pilot later informed passengers that air traffic control had failed to advise them of the military aircraft, prompting the evasive maneuver for safety. The FAA has launched an investigation to determine the proximity of the two aircraft and the precise nature of the communication lapse, leaving the shaken passenger seeking answers about the unusual and unsettling experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old British man from Harlow, Essex, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for what he believed were Russian intelligence agents. Phillips, who reportedly "dreamt about being like James Bond," offered to provide personal information about former defense secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals who were, in fact, undercover British intelligence officers. He engaged in communication via WhatsApp and held in-person meetings, even leaving a USB drive containing a document that declared his "100% loyalty and dedication" to a foreign power. Phillips' conviction highlights his audacious pursuit of financial gain, despite the potential severe detriment to his country's national security.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates but revealed a $1.1 billion impact from President Donald Trump's ongoing auto tariffs. Despite this significant cost, the automaker affirmed its full-year guidance, which anticipates a total tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion. GM is actively implementing strategies, including manufacturing adjustments and targeted cost initiatives, to "greatly reduce" its tariff exposure, with a substantial portion attributed to its Korea business. CFO Paul Jacobson indicated that the company does not expect specific price increases for consumers due to these tariffs, as it focuses on maintaining profitability amidst trade uncertainties.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has announced a pilot program designed to increase the security allowance for members of the House of Representatives by an additional $20,000 through the end of the fiscal year, September 30. This measure, which also includes a $5,000 increase for personal security monitoring and maintenance, directly addresses an "enhanced threat environment" faced by lawmakers. The decision follows recent tragic events, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern and the shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses.

          <p>Sonya Sotinsky, an oral cancer survivor, profoundly lost her ability to speak after surgery removed her tongue and voice box. Determined to retain her identity, she recorded hours of her voice, including children's books and a collection of curse words, before the procedure. When conventional medical solutions proved insufficient, Sotinsky independently sought out and utilized artificial intelligence technology to create an exact replica of her natural voice, now accessible through a phone app. This breakthrough has allowed her to communicate with her characteristic inflection and sarcasm, which she considers vital to her personality. Her journey underscores the deep connection between voice and identity, while also exposing the challenges of securing insurance coverage for such innovative, quality-of-life-improving technologies.</p>

The program, which commenced payouts in April and will accept applications until March 2026, has expanded eligibility to include employees from Fayed's private airline. Harrods has also initiated a High Court case to replace the executors of Fayed's estate, citing a lack of progress in settling his affairs and a need to safeguard assets for potential claimants. This comprehensive effort follows numerous allegations of sexual assault and abuse against Fayed during his tenure, with a BBC investigation revealing that Harrods allegedly failed to intervene and even facilitated cover-ups.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has revealed that its highly anticipated Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) will return on August 26, marking an earlier debut than its traditional September launch. This seasonal rollout, which also includes new fall menu items such as the Pecan Oatmilk Cortado and Italian Sausage Egg Bites, is strategically timed. It aims to revitalize sales and increase foot traffic amidst a period of stalled growth for the coffee giant, which saw U.S. same-store sales slip last year. The PSL, first introduced in 2003, has evolved into Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage and is a key component of CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" campaign, designed to leverage nostalgic "cultural touchstones" to re-attract customers.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the cusp of completing a significant transfer deal for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with a fee of 73.5 million euros (£63.5 million). Although negotiations regarding add-on payments have extended the process beyond Arsenal's desired pre-season tour start, the 27-year-old Swedish international has already agreed to a five-year contract with the club. Gyokeres has been highly sought after following an exceptional season where he netted 54 goals in 52 appearances for Sporting. This acquisition is considered a crucial move for manager Mikel Arteta, who has been keen to secure an elite center-forward to enhance Arsenal's offensive prowess and bridge the scoring gap from last season.</p>

Hall was among 11 American soldiers whose bodies could not be recovered after their unit was attacked by Japanese commandos at Lima Site 85 on a remote mountain in Laos. Following previous unsuccessful attempts, recent joint recovery operations by U.S. and Laotian teams discovered human remains and other evidence, which anthropological and DNA analysis confirmed belonged to Hall. His family was informed last month, and his name will now be marked on the Courts of the Missing. Hall is scheduled to be buried in Altoona, Kansas, in September, bringing a long-awaited sense of closure.</p>

This decision follows HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's company, Autonomy, for $11.1 billion, during which HPE alleged that Lynch and his former CFO misrepresented Autonomy's financial health. The court concluded that HPE had indeed overpaid due to an incorrect financial presentation. Lynch, who tragically died last year when his yacht sank, had previously been acquitted of related fraud charges in the U.S. HPE welcomed the ruling, signaling progress towards the resolution of this protracted legal dispute.</p>

New companies, such as David Protein Bars and Protein Pints, are also experiencing rapid growth.
