        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's efforts to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill fell short during a visit to Capitol Hill. The "SALT Caucus" opposes the bill because they believe it doesn't adequately boost state and local tax deductions for their constituents. A 2017 Republican tax bill capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, seen as a political move against Democratic-leaning states. The current bill proposes raising the deduction to $30,000, which is still insufficient for some GOP lawmakers from these states, threatening the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump cautioned House Republicans against tampering with Medicaid while urging them to pass a tax bill. His warning came during a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill. The movement on the tax bill is stalled by a group of Republicans who want cuts to Medicaid and the addition of work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that work requirements would create a bureaucratic nightmare, potentially impacting nearly 80 million Americans covered by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the life-saving impact of Medicaid, particularly for low-income adults and those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that loss of Medicaid coverage, which includes a prescription drug subsidy, led to decreased prescription fills and increased mortality. These findings underscore the potential deadly effects of proposed Medicaid cuts and increased eligibility checks.</p>

The move highlights the delicate balance businesses face in appeasing customers, shareholders, and the White House. Tariffs have emerged as a topic where corporate leaders are more willing to publicly criticize Trump's policies. Walmart reiterated its commitment to low prices but acknowledged the magnitude of tariff increases.</p>
