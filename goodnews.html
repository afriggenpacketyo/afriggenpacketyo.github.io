          <p>China has confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will attend a major military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This will be Kim's first visit to China since 2019 and is considered a significant diplomatic event, as he will join other leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin. The parade is expected to showcase China's latest military technology and serves as a powerful geopolitical signal from Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Analysts view the gathering as a strategic move by Xi to demonstrate his influence over regional leaders amid ongoing diplomatic discussions with the United States.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. The Bank of Korea (BOK) also provided an updated economic outlook, upgrading its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2.0%. This decision comes after recent trade agreements with the U.S. have eased some economic headwinds, though the BOK remains cautious about the potential impact of tariffs on future export growth. Analysts suggest the central bank may consider rate cuts later in the year if inflationary pressures remain stable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of China's central bank, has called for a more cautious and multidimensional assessment of stablecoins, warning against the hype surrounding their potential use. He highlighted the systemic risks these digital currencies could pose, including their potential for excessive use in asset speculation, which could lead to fraud and financial instability. His comments come as countries like the U.S. and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks, and speculation grows about China potentially introducing a yuan-backed stablecoin. Zhou stressed the need to evaluate their genuine utility rather than focusing on speculative valuation, which he argued is detrimental to the financial system's health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors processed several key economic developments, including the Bank of Korea's decision to hold its interest rate steady at 2.5%. While South Korea's Kospi saw modest gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 both declined. Attention is also on Indian markets, which face new U.S. tariffs, and on regional chip stocks following Nvidia's strong earnings report. The varied performance reflects ongoing uncertainty, with traders balancing positive corporate news against broader concerns about trade tensions and their potential impact on regional economic growth.

          <p>A viral online claim suggesting President Donald Trump has only six to eight months to live due to congestive heart failure and kidney disease is unfounded. The rumor originated from a TikTok video by a physical therapist, not a medical doctor, who speculated based on observations of swelling and bruising. The White House had previously addressed these symptoms in July, stating that the President has chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, and that bruising on his hand was from handshaking and aspirin use. Official medical reports from the Physician to the President confirm that examinations found no signs of heart failure or renal impairment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, all 32 NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year, according to a new report. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized that the funds must be converted into genuine military capability.</p>

          <p>A controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," will be empty of detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management confirmed the development in an email to an interfaith community group that had been seeking access to the facility. The detention center has been the subject of lawsuits, one of which successfully halted the transfer of new detainees to the site. The closure of this facility comes as Governor Ron DeSantis's administration announces plans to open a new immigration center in the state called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by high demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirms Nvidia's central role in the global AI infrastructure boom, with the company projecting sales of $54 billion for the current quarter. The results also highlighted strong growth in its gaming and robotics divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed a new chief film liaison to serve as a bridge between City Hall and the entertainment industry. Board of Public Works president Steve Kang will take on the role, which had been vacant since Bass took office, frustrating industry advocates. The position is considered crucial for helping film and television productions navigate the city's complex bureaucracy. The appointment comes at a critical time, as Los Angeles faces a production slump and increasing competition from other locations offering more favorable filming conditions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that there is a "real possibility" of the company supplying its advanced Blackwell AI processors to the Chinese market, contingent on U.S. government approval. His comments followed a meeting with President Trump, where a deal was struck to allow sales of the current-generation H20 chip to China in exchange for a 15% revenue share to the U.S. government. Huang argued that enabling American tech companies to lead in the global AI race is crucial, even if it means providing modified, export-compliant versions of top-tier chips to China. He estimated the Chinese AI market represents a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program, offering working parents in England 30 hours of childcare per week for children aged nine months to three years, starting in September. To qualify, most parents must earn above a minimum threshold but less than £100,000 annually. While the program aims to alleviate high childcare costs, concerns remain about the availability of staff and places to meet the increased demand. Additionally, many providers charge for extras like meals and supplies because government funding rates often do not cover their full operational costs, which can be a barrier for some families.</p>
