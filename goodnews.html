          <h2>Analysis: Trump's UK Visit Highlights Warm Royal Relations but Limited Policy Influence</h2>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK was marked by elaborate royal pageantry, which he clearly enjoyed, and a cordial relationship with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. However, an analysis suggests that while the personal connections were strong, Britain's ability to influence U.S. policy remains limited. Despite amicable discussions on issues like Gaza and Ukraine, Trump did not alter his fundamental positions. According to the president's chief of staff, the visit will not change U.S. policy on trade or international affairs. The key outcome for the UK appears to be maintaining a positive relationship, allowing for respectful disagreement without incurring diplomatic penalties.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, declared that smart glasses represent the next major evolution in computing, offering more natural and intuitive interfaces. The company recently unveiled its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband, allowing users to send messages and record video. This new model builds on the success of previous audio-only versions, which sold two million units. As Meta deepens its investment in wearable technology, it faces growing competition from companies like Google, Snap, and Apple, all of whom are developing their own smart glasses.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is described as a thrilling and urgent departure from his typically historical settings. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former paramilitary revolutionary living in hiding, the movie is a modern-day story about political violence and government overreach. Inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland," the film melds high-octane action sequences with thoughtful commentary on radicalism and family. The review praises the film's fast pace, stellar performances from DiCaprio and Sean Penn, and its ability to tackle raw contemporary issues while remaining an emotionally engaging blockbuster.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted a Los Angeles protester, Brayan Ramos-Brito, of misdemeanor assault charges against a U.S. border patrol agent. The verdict is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the case was the first to go to trial following a series of demonstrations against immigration raids. The defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents' testimony, particularly that of a senior border patrol chief who was the only witness to claim he saw the assault. Video evidence presented in court showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault, and discrepancies in official reports were highlighted during the trial.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer successfully navigated President Trump's state visit without major diplomatic incidents, maintaining a cordial tone despite policy differences on issues like Palestinian statehood. However, an analysis suggests that while the visit strengthened personal ties, it is unlikely Starmer changed Trump's thinking on key global issues such as the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Trump remained firm in his positions, focusing on the release of hostages in Gaza and expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin but offering no new strategy. The primary success for Starmer appears to be reinforcing the UK-U.S. relationship while avoiding open conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has seen a modest decrease. A new $50,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $487, down slightly from approximately $493 at the start of 2025. While the savings are not dramatic, they can accumulate significantly over the life of the loan. With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of equity, these loans remain an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

The complaint alleges that the companies enable brokers to buy large quantities of tickets, which are then resold at inflated prices, costing consumers billions. The suit also claims Ticketmaster engages in deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing and privately benefits from the broker system it publicly condemns. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit filed in May that accused the companies of monopolizing the live entertainment industry.</p>
