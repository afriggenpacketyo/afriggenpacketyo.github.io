          <p>Fashion retailer H&M announced better-than-expected third-quarter results, causing its shares to jump significantly. The company's operating profit rose 40% year-on-year to 4.9 billion Swedish krona, surpassing analyst forecasts. This positive performance is attributed to CEO Daniel Erver's turnaround strategy, which focuses on tight cost controls, store optimizations, and a return to core product lines. Despite the success, H&M noted that upcoming U.S. tariffs could impact future pricing and consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

The engagement is seen as a signal of the close alignment between Beijing and Pyongyang, even as North Korea also deepens its relationship with Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the growing problem of spam calls and texts, Apple has introduced new screening features in its latest iOS update. One major feature, which is off by default, uses AI to have Siri ask unknown callers for their name and reason for calling, transcribing the response for the user in real-time. Another new feature, enabled by default, enhances the filtering of spam text messages into a separate folder, disabling links for security. These tools aim to give users more control over their communications, as a high percentage of Americans now avoid answering calls from unknown numbers due to scams.</p>

Manager Pep Guardiola brought on the two academy graduates, aged 17 and 19 respectively, late in the second half of the 2-0 victory. Both brothers joined City's youth system at age eight and have been regulars in the academy sides. Their appearance marks a proud moment for their family and a notable milestone as they follow in their father's footsteps in professional football.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to provide clearer information about ticket prices. The inquiry was launched after fans complained about the pricing for Oasis's reunion tour, where identically-seated tickets were sold at vastly different prices without clear explanation. Ticketmaster will now have to provide more details about tiered pricing systems and anticipated costs during online queues. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," it stated the company must ensure its labeling does not mislead consumers about the value of different tickets.</p>

          <h2>NYC Mayoral Candidate's Challenge to FIFA Pricing Seen as a Model for Left-Wing Sports Engagement</h2>

          <p>New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani's recent campaign against FIFA's dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup is being analyzed as a strategic move to reconnect progressive politics with sports. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, launched a petition demanding price caps and affordable tickets for local residents, aligning the issue with his broader affordability agenda. The article suggests this represents an opportunity for the political left to engage with a cultural arena often dominated by right-wing figures. By framing the high cost of soccer tickets as an issue of corporate greed, Mamdani is tapping into a progressive-leaning fanbase and highlighting real-world economic issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their October electricity bills as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund is generated by the state's cap-and-invest program, which requires large polluters to purchase allowances for their greenhouse gas emissions. The credit amount varies by utility provider, with customers of PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E receiving between $56 and $82. Following recent legislation extending the program, these credits are expected to increase in the coming years, providing further financial relief to ratepayers.</p>

          <p>Teresa Sánchez-Gordon, the new president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, brings a unique perspective to the role, shaped by her childhood experience of nearly being deported. Now 74, the retired judge and former federal public defender will help guide the LAPD's policies amid the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Sánchez-Gordon has expressed concern about the perception of LAPD officers working with federal agents and the fear this creates within immigrant communities. Her appointment places a figure with deep personal understanding of immigration issues at the head of the civilian body overseeing one of the nation's largest police departments.</p>
