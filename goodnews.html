          <p>With interest rates declining from their recent highs, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) are facing lower yields for automatic rollovers. Financial experts advise against letting CDs renew by default, as banks will lock in the current, lower rates. Instead, they recommend that account holders use the grace period to compare rates from different institutions or consider alternative options like high-yield savings accounts. This proactive approach can help maximize returns in a changing economic environment where once-common 5% yields have become scarce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Oracle saw a significant increase after the U.S. and China reached a framework agreement concerning the future of TikTok. While full details remain undisclosed, reports suggest Oracle will play a key role, potentially continuing its cloud deal to manage U.S. user data under its "Project Texas" initiative. The deal follows years of uncertainty and a congressional mandate requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns. The market's positive reaction reflects investor optimism about Oracle's potential involvement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares in Oracle experienced a nearly 4% increase following the announcement that the U.S. and China have reached a preliminary framework deal for TikTok during trade talks in Madrid.

The agreement is a significant development in the ongoing saga over TikTok's future, which has been uncertain due to a U.S. law requiring its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest over national security concerns.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates Amid Conflicting Economic Signals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 this week, though the decision is complicated by conflicting economic data. While a slowing labor market suggests a need for stimulus, persistent inflation, partly fueled by tariffs, argues for caution. The central bank also faces political pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs, a factor Fed Chair Jerome Powell insists will not influence the committee's data-driven approach. Economists are watching closely to see how the Fed balances its dual mandate of controlling inflation and ensuring full employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that the company's expansion is outpacing rivals because customers are choosing United for its superior product, network, and technology. While other airlines are scaling back growth plans due to an oversupply of flights, United's domestic capacity is set to grow by 5.7% in 2025. Kirby emphasized that brand loyalty has made the airline resilient and positioned it for strong performance as the economy recovers. The airline is also two-thirds of the way through a major initiative to upgrade the interiors of its narrow-body fleet.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has voiced support for President Trump's suggestion to replace quarterly corporate earnings reports with a semiannual system. Bessent argued the move could help revitalize public markets by reducing compliance costs for companies, encouraging them to focus on long-term growth rather than short-term metrics. The proposal aligns U.S. practice with that of many European and some Asian jurisdictions. However, some investor groups have previously raised concerns that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency and inadequately protect their interests. (not investment advice)</p>

The primary obstacles holding them back are financial instability, fear of failure, and a lack of business knowledge. Experts advise that these challenges can be overcome with strategic planning, such as starting a business as a side hustle to test its viability and saving a safety net of three to six months of expenses. Building a solid business plan and seeking mentorship are also crucial steps to mitigate risks and increase the chances of success.</p>
