          <p>Lithium Americas' stock soared nearly 80% following news that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This proposal emerged as Lithium Americas renegotiates a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. The administration aims to create a cash buffer and mitigate taxpayer risk by taking a small equity share. This action marks the White House's latest effort to secure direct ownership in mineral supply chains critical to U.S. interests, with the Thacker Pass project poised to become a significant North American lithium source for electric vehicle batteries.

It emphasizes that despite rates being higher than in previous years, favorable options are still accessible, particularly for individuals with robust credit scores. The article advises prospective borrowers to enhance their credit profiles, compare offers from multiple lenders, and meticulously review loan terms and associated fees.

          <p>The remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman found dead in 1946, were exhumed in Oregon this week as officials aim to solve the state's oldest unidentified person case. The victim, believed to be 30-50 years old, suffered blunt-force trauma and was dismembered, with her remains discovered in burlap sacks along the Williamette River. After critical evidence went missing in the 1950s, the case stalled for decades. The Oregon State Police's Human Identification Program recently located her likely burial site, and the exhumation will allow for advanced forensic testing, hoping to finally identify her and bring resolution to the nearly 80-year-old mystery.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) announced the arrest of a suspect in connection with recent cyberattacks that significantly disrupted air travel at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Dublin, Brussels, and Berlin. The individual, a man in his 40s, was apprehended in southern England. These attacks, linked to "third-party ransomware" affecting Collins Aerospace software, forced airports to resort to manual check-ins and baggage handling, resulting in widespread delays and cancellations. The NCA highlighted this arrest as a positive initial step in their ongoing investigation into the persistent and globally impactful threat of cybercrime.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension by ABC, delivering an emotional monologue addressing his controversial remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder. Kimmel stated it was "never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man" or blame any specific group, acknowledging that his comments might have been ill-timed or unclear. The suspension followed criticism from the Trump administration and FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who suggested broadcast licenses could be at risk. Kimmel emphasized the importance of free speech, while some affiliate stations, like Nexstar and Sinclair, continued to preempt his show.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand stalled last week, rising only 0.6%, despite a further drop in interest rates, following a significant 58% surge in refinance activity the week prior. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 6.34%, its lowest since September 2024, though rates saw volatility after the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Refinance demand increased slightly by 1%, now 80% higher than four weeks ago and comprising over 60% of all application activity. The article notes that while homebuyer demand remains relatively strong for the season, adjustable-rate mortgage demand decreased after its recent spike. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts emphasize that healthcare costs, including those not covered by Medicare, are rising significantly, and long-term care can be extremely expensive. Housing costs, even for paid-off homes, include increasing insurance and property taxes. Retirees may also face unexpected tax burdens from Social Security benefits, retirement account withdrawals, and home sales. The article stresses the importance of careful planning, visualizing retirement, and working with a financial professional to ensure a comfortable and secure future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the league could begin renegotiating its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. This move could add billions to the NFL's revenue, contingent on agreement from current partners like Disney, Comcast, Paramount, Amazon, and Fox. The article notes the NFL's content dominates traditional television viewership, making early renegotiation attractive for both the league and its partners seeking extended control. Goodell indicated the changing media landscape incentivizes flexibility, potentially allowing the league to secure new deals and explore partnerships with emerging platforms like YouTube and Netflix.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights the importance of asking a financial professional if they are a "fiduciary" to ensure trustworthy financial advice. A fiduciary has a legal duty to act in their client's best interest, unlike those who follow only a "suitability" standard, which merely requires recommendations to be appropriate. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher-cost investments or products that benefit the advisor more than the client, potentially costing tens of thousands over time. The article advises checking an advisor's Form ADV via the SEC's public disclosure site and seeking fee-only advisors who are fiduciaries 100% of the time. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is advocating for an ambitious constitutional reform that would allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year limit. This initiative aims to synchronize presidential and National Assembly elections, promoting policy continuity and greater governmental responsibility. While proponents argue it addresses political instability caused by misaligned terms, analysts note that passing such changes requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority and a national referendum, likely facing strong opposition. The article also mentions proposed alterations concerning sexual minorities' rights and North Korea, which are expected to trigger further resistance from conservatives.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised President Trump's "productive meeting" and "well-informed" understanding of the Russia-Ukraine war, following Trump's public pivot on Ukraine's battlefield ambitions. Trump, via social media, suggested Ukraine could "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form" with European and NATO support, a significant departure from his previous skepticism about Kyiv's ability to liberate occupied territories. While the Kremlin disputed Trump's assessment of Russia as a "paper tiger," Zelenskyy saw the shift as a "big shift" and a potential "game changer," indicating Trump's awareness of more battlefield details aligning with Ukraine's intelligence.</p>
