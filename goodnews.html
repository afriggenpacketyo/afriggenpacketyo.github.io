          <p>Following a day of royal pageantry at Windsor Castle, President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom is transitioning to focus on substantive political and economic matters. He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers for discussions centered on a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, tariffs, and geopolitical issues such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The visit has already been marked by the announcement of £150 billion in U.S. investment into the UK, signaling a key objective of the diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Shares for pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk surged after it announced that a late-stage trial for its oral obesity pill, a tablet version of Wegovy, demonstrated 'significant' weight reduction. The phase 3 trial showed an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks, with a tolerability profile similar to its popular injectable counterpart. This development positions the company to offer patients a needle-free alternative and intensifies competition in the rapidly growing market for oral weight-loss treatments, with a U.S. FDA decision expected later this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's recent ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google attempts to address the company's monopoly in internet search without hindering its ability to compete in the emerging field of artificial intelligence. The remedies imposed, which include a ban on exclusive search engine deals but allow Google to keep its Chrome browser, are seen by some analysts as insufficient to truly level the playing field. The case highlights the significant challenge courts face in applying century-old antitrust laws to the rapidly evolving technology sector.</p>
