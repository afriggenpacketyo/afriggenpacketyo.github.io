        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially lifted economic sanctions on Syria through an executive order, a move intended to support the nation's path toward peace and stability under its new government. The action follows a promise made in May and aims to give Syria's interim government, led by former insurgent Ahmad al-Sharaa, an opportunity to rebuild. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, it retains targeted restrictions against former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Officials emphasized the goal is not nation-building but to encourage normalization with neighbors, including potential inclusion in the Abraham Accords.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's stock price surged to a new all-time high, reflecting strong investor confidence in the company's focus on artificial intelligence. The rally is fueled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive hiring campaign to build a new AI superintelligence group, which has included poaching top talent from rivals like OpenAI and acquiring key executives from other AI firms. This strategic push involves significant investments, such as a $14.3 billion deal involving Scale AI, as Meta competes with other tech giants in the race for AI dominance. The company's focus on superintelligence, a technology that surpasses human capability, is driving its market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is testing a mandatory facial recognition feature for new users in California to combat fraud and enhance user safety. The "Face Check" system, powered by FaceTec technology, requires users to submit a short video selfie to verify they are a real person and that their appearance matches their profile photos. This initiative aims to reduce the prevalence of bots, spoofed accounts, and romance scams, which have become a significant issue on dating platforms. While photo verification was previously optional, this pilot makes it a requirement for account creation in the state, with no current plans for a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>This article offers guidance for consumers whose debt disputes are denied by credit bureaus or debt collectors, leaving a negative mark on their credit report. Instead of abandoning the issue, the article suggests several proactive strategies to resolve the debt itself. These options include negotiating a settlement for a lower lump-sum payment, using a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency to reduce interest rates, or consolidating debts with a lower-rate loan. For those facing severe financial hardship, inquiring about assistance programs or, as a last resort, considering bankruptcy are also presented as potential pathways. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of the genetics company 23andMe to a nonprofit research institute established by its co-founder, Anne Wojcicki. The $305 million deal allows the company's vast trove of customer DNA data to remain under its existing management and privacy policies, avoiding a controversial transfer to a third party. The sale followed a lawsuit from over two dozen states that blocked a previous acquisition by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, citing concerns over the handling of sensitive genetic information. While most states are satisfied with this outcome, a few remain opposed, highlighting ongoing legal questions about data privacy.</p>

          <p>The White House has declared that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump after Canada announced it would scrap its digital services tax (DST). The proposed 3% tax would have affected large U.S. technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and halted trade deal negotiations in response, Canada reversed its position, with officials stating a preference for a multilateral agreement on digital taxation. The White House framed the reversal as a "big victory" for American companies and a result of President Trump's tough negotiating tactics.</p>

To promote the launch, Robinhood is giving away tokens to new users in the EU. The tokenization of private companies is currently limited to Europe due to its more flexible regulatory environment, as U.S. rules for accredited investors prevent a similar offering domestically for now.
