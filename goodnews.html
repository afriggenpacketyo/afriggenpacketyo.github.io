          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, initiating a disarmament process. This move, which includes demands for the release of leader Abdullah Ocalan and legal reforms, presents a significant opportunity for peace after a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives. While Turkey's government remains cautious, a successful resolution could enhance its stability and improve relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria. The process is seen as a pivotal step that could positively alter Turkey's geopolitical standing in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Construction workers installing a water pipeline in the historic harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, have discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found buried approximately 30 inches beneath the seabed in the city's Old Town, a location famous as a filming site for "Game of Thrones." Marine archaeologists have confirmed the ship's age through radiocarbon dating and are now working to protect the wreck for further examination. This discovery adds to a series of recent maritime archaeological finds across Europe.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging business climate in China, high-end hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling street food.

This pivot from expensive banquets to budget-friendly options reflects a broader trend of businesses adapting to shifting consumer behavior and economic pressures. The move highlights the necessity for even luxury brands to prioritize survival and meet customers where they are.</p>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of Live Aid, the monumental 1985 benefit concert is remembered as a landmark event in global broadcasting and fundraising for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, it united billions of viewers and featured iconic performances from music legends. However, retrospective analysis highlights significant flaws, including a lack of African performers and female representation, and criticism of perpetuating a "white savior" narrative. Despite these critiques, the event's impact on charity concerts and its ability to place humanitarian issues on the global political agenda remain undeniable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English instead of the currently used Latin-based International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system. Advocates, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue that Latin names like "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis" for sweet almond oil pose a serious risk to consumers who cannot easily identify potential allergens. While the industry association defends the INCI system for providing global consistency, families affected by allergic reactions are pushing for clearer, more accessible labeling standards similar to those for food products.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing the impact of two large Chinese dams on the Brahmaputra River suggests they may alleviate, rather than worsen, dry-season water shortages in downstream India. Contrary to fears that China's dam-building activities in Tibet could trigger droughts, the research found that low-flow water levels in February increased by over 50 percent. The data, collected since 2014, indicates that regulated water release from the dams significantly boosts river flow throughout the dry season. This finding provides a new perspective on the contentious issue of transboundary water management between the two nations.</p>
