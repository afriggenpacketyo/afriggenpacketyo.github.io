          <p>Novo Nordisk has ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, alleging that the telehealth company sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, its weight-loss drug, posing a risk to patient safety. The Danish drugmaker accused Hims & Hers of deceptive marketing and failing to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization. This decision came shortly after the companies announced a long-term collaboration to improve obesity treatment accessibility. Novo Nordisk stated it will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms committed to patient safety.</p>
