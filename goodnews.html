          <h2>Japanese Regions Benefit Economically from Anime and Manga Tourism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 22:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Meiji Yasuda Research Institute indicates that foreign tourism to anime and manga-related locations in Japan has significantly boosted local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists visited these sites, contributing to an estimated 54.3 billion yen in related goods purchases, a 53% increase from 2016. The phenomenon, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting places that inspired or were settings for popular works, with the Homangu Kamado Shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture being a prime example. While the trend offers economic benefits, local governments must address overtourism issues by developing multilingual support systems and training local tourism volunteers. The growing popularity of Japanese entertainment content could also help reduce Japan's digital trade deficit. Optimism that this trend will continue to boost local economies is tempered by the need for sustainable tourism management.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 22:18:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, has opened a ramen noodle restaurant and plans to open more to diversify its offerings. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business due to saturation in the beef bowl market. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, prompting consumers to seek alternatives like frozen udon noodles and yogurt. This shift reflects changing consumer preferences amid rising costs and companies adapting to maintain affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan after previous attempts to extract DNA failed. Researchers successfully extracted DNA from dental calculus, calcified dental plaque, and compared it to previous samples. The findings indicate that the "dragon man" is the first intact Denisovan specimen discovered to date. Denisovans are known to have coexisted with modern-day humans and are closely related to Neanderthals, expanding our understanding of human evolution. The skull was originally hidden from the Japanese army by a Chinese laborer and later donated to a museum.</p>

          <p>A recent deadly border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has put China's neighborhood diplomacy to the test, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in the region. Analysts suggest that China will likely monitor the situation closely while avoiding direct mediation.

While the risk of a wider escalation is considered low, the incident could impact China's efforts to foster closer regional ties amid competition with the United States.

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has been suspended for one game by MLB following a benches-clearing altercation with the San Diego Padres. In addition to the suspension, Roberts was fined an undisclosed amount. Padres manager Mike Shildt also received a one-game suspension and fine, while Padres pitcher Robert Suarez was suspended three games for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani with a pitch. The incident occurred after Dodgers pitcher Jack Little hit Fernando Tatis Jr. with a pitch, leading to a heated exchange between the managers and a subsequent clearing of the benches. Bench coach Danny Lehmann will manage the Dodgers in Roberts' absence.</p>
