          <p>The New York Yankees have released veteran starting pitcher Marcus Stroman to create roster space for their recent trade deadline acquisitions. The team added three new pitchers: David Bednar, Camilo Doval, and Jake Bird, necessitating the move. Stroman, who signed a two-year contract before the 2024 season, had a 6.23 ERA over nine starts this year. The decision was made to release the 34-year-old pitcher instead of optioning a younger player, signaling a strategic shift in the team's pitching staff as they push for the postseason.</p>

          <p>The NFL is reportedly on the verge of acquiring an ownership stake in ESPN, a move expected to be announced by parent company Disney. In exchange for the equity, ESPN is anticipated to take operational control of the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership, which has been under negotiation for over a year, aims to address the challenges of declining pay-TV subscriptions while strengthening the ties between the sports league and its major media partner. The deal could significantly alter the landscape for future media rights negotiations.</p>

          <p>A debate has been reignited in Germany over the necessity of raising the national retirement age beyond 67 to address the country's demographic challenges and ensure the pension system's sustainability. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche's suggestion to "work more and longer" has faced backlash from political opponents and trade unions, who argue it would unfairly penalize those in physically demanding jobs. The discussion highlights the strain of an aging population, with the ratio of workers to pensioners declining sharply. Experts suggest a combination of reforms is needed to solve the issue.</p>

          <p>The Presidential Fitness Test, a former staple of American physical education for over 50 years, is being reinstated by an executive order from President Trump. The standardized set of exercises, which was phased out in 2013, measured students' physical fitness through drills like the one-mile run and push-ups. The administration cites declining physical well-being and rising obesity rates as threats to the nation's vitality. While the move is intended to promote youth health, educators express mixed reactions, hoping a revamped version will focus on lifelong healthy habits rather than just competitive performance.</p>
