          <p>Consumer price inflation in the euro zone rose to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in months. This figure, which matched economists' expectations, followed a drop to 1.9% in May. Core inflation remained steady at 2.3%, while services inflation saw a slight increase. The data reinforces expectations that the ECB may proceed with an interest rate cut in the third quarter, with the bank's chief economist suggesting the recent cycle of policy interventions is now complete.</p>

          <p>Democrat Colin Allred, a former NFL player and U.S. Representative, has officially launched his 2026 campaign for the U.S. Senate in Texas. His entry sets the stage for a competitive race, particularly as incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton. Allred's campaign focuses on lowering costs and opposing what he terms corrupt politicians. Democrats view the race as a key opportunity, though they face significant historical challenges, having not won a statewide Texas race since 1994.</p>

          <p>State and national lawmakers are pushing for legislation to improve medical training on menopause, addressing a significant gap in physician education. A 2023 study found that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training, leaving many patients with unresponsive or inadequate care for symptoms like hot flashes and cognitive issues. California's Assembly Bill 432, if passed, would mandate menopause coursework for license renewal for certain doctors. This legislative trend, seen in over a dozen states, aims to ensure physicians are better equipped to treat a condition experienced by half the population.</p>

          <p>Fewer Americans voted by mail in the 2024 election compared to the 2020 pandemic peak, while early in-person voting saw a significant rise, according to a new federal report. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission found that mail ballots constituted 30.3% of turnout, down from 43% in 2020 but still above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, in-person voting surged, with a majority of ballots cast either early or on Election Day for the first time. The data suggests a shift in voter preference as pandemic-era measures recede and early in-person options become more widespread.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Huawei has made two of its Pangu series artificial intelligence models open-source, a strategic move to foster a broader AI ecosystem and expand its international presence. This follows a trend among Chinese tech companies, like Baidu, to promote open-source development. Experts believe this will incentivize the use of Huawei's other products, particularly its Ascend AI chips, which are China's primary competitor to Nvidia's advanced hardware. By integrating its software and hardware, Huawei aims to solidify its position across the entire AI value chain, overcoming U.S. export restrictions.</p>

          <p>China has offered a tax refund to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy and R√©my Martin, amid an ongoing anti-dumping investigation into European brandy. According to a source, the offer is conditional on the companies agreeing to a minimum selling price and committing to fair trade practices. The investigation is set to conclude on July 5, and if no agreement is reached, temporary tariffs of up to 39% could become permanent. This move is seen as a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between China and the European Union.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an optimized model using satellite data to accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from individual power plants. This new framework could provide a standardized, high-precision methodology for the global carbon inventory, which currently lacks such a system. The study demonstrated the significant potential of satellite remote sensing for tracking emissions from specific sources. The scientists suggest this technology could also be applied to monitor other industrial sites, such as oil and gas fields or steel plants, enabling better detection of anomalous emission events.</p>
