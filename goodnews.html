        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong aims to enhance its green marine fuel capabilities by establishing a robust supply chain for green methanol, requiring tax-free import, storage, and sale of mainland-produced fuel. CM Energy's president, Wang Yongxin, highlighted Hong Kong's existing liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations but stressed the critical need for methanol infrastructure. This push coincides with the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, a dual-fuel vehicle carrier. Despite green methanol costing four times more than traditional fuel, its usage is expected to increase significantly from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading as the Reserve Bank of Australia commenced its two-day policy meeting, with expectations for the cash rate to remain steady at 3.6%. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia noted "real tension" in economic data, pointing to inflation risks and a cyclical upswing, alongside signs of softer employment and moderating wages. While Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix declined after hitting record highs. US markets saw gains on Friday following inflation data, breaking a three-day losing streak for major indexes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tutu Atwell, previously underutilized, delivered a pivotal 88-yard touchdown from Matthew Stafford late in the game, securing a 27-20 comeback win for the Los Angeles Rams against the Indianapolis Colts. The victory, improving the Rams' record to 3-1, also featured strong performances from Stafford, Puka Nacua (with 13 catches for 170 yards), and an improved run defense that contained Jonathan Taylor. Despite some imperfections, the team appears to be a Super Bowl contender early in the season. The Rams now prepare for a quick turnaround, facing the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday night.</p>

Europe had established a record seven-point lead after the first two days, needing only three points for victory. Tyrrell Hatton ultimately secured the decisive half-point, marking Europe's fifth away win. Captain Luke Donald, who also won as a player, made history with consecutive home and away captaincies. The US matched a Ryder Cup record by winning 8.5 points in the singles, but Europe's early dominance proved insurmountable.</p>

          <p>Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), is credited with transforming the league from an unprofitable, unsanctioned operation into a global phenomenon valued at over $15 billion. His success is attributed to risk-taking and a strong personality, securing early support from Donald Trump, who will now host a historic UFC fight at the White House. White maintains an "unapologetically masculine" brand and champions free speech, even "hate speech," citing concerns about "cancel culture" in the wake of the Charlie Kirk assassination. The UFC recently secured an $8 billion media rights deal.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for tourists starting next spring to combat severe overcrowding. With 2.6 million visitors annually and only 100 residents, the influx has led to a lack of privacy for inhabitants, who report tourists entering gardens and homes. The fee will include admission to the museum and windmills, which are currently separate charges. While some tourists understand the need for preservation, local businesses fear a significant loss of income due to the increased cost, particularly for families.</p>

          <p>The Kārearea, or New Zealand falcon, a majestic raptor known for its speed, has won New Zealand's fiercely contested annual Bird of the Year election, run by conservation group Forest & Bird. The poll aims to highlight the country's native bird species, 80% of which are threatened. Despite past controversies involving bats and fraudulent votes, this year's election saw over 75,000 ballots cast, with the falcon winning fairly. While celebrating the winner, conservationists express concern over declining government investment in protecting these vulnerable species from predators and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw ended his illustrious 18-year regular-season career with a dominant performance, pitching 5 ⅓ scoreless innings, striking out seven, and earning his 223rd career win. His career ERA now stands at an impressive 2.53, the best among starting pitchers in the live ball era. Manager Dave Roberts orchestrated an emotional exit, having Freddie Freeman remove Kershaw from the mound to a standing ovation. While Kershaw won't be on the wild card roster, he remains a potential asset for later postseason rounds. The Dodgers clinched their division, with Shohei Ohtani hitting a club-record 55th home run.</p>

The scheme, involving private companies sharing wage costs, is funded from existing budgets and will be detailed in the upcoming Budget.

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts now prepares his team to face the Cincinnati Reds in the NL wild card series, who clinched the final spot after the Mets' loss. The article highlights concerns for the Dodgers, including the Reds' surprising late-season surge under veteran manager Terry Francona. Key Reds players like Elly De La Cruz, a dynamic switch-hitter, and strong starting pitching, particularly Hunter Greene, pose significant threats. The Reds also boast a reliable closer in Emilio Pagán. Recent postseason history suggests lower-seeded road teams often succeed in the best-of-three wild card format, emphasizing unpredictability.

Divergent views emerged on Proposition 36, an anti-crime measure, and single-payer healthcare.
