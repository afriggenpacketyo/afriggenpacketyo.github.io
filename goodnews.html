          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, narrowly outpacing Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso. Despite his strong performance, Alonso downplayed his team's chances of competing for a front-row start, suggesting the McLarens are out of reach. Norris expressed that Aston Martin's speed was not surprising, noting their recent improvements. The sessions were marked by several incidents, including crashes by Lance Stroll and Alex Albon, as teams prepared for a weekend where rain is expected to impact Saturday's qualifying.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed a lower court's decision, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by trying to vacate a prior TPS extension. The court's ruling emphasizes that Congress designed the TPS system to be predictable and insulated from political shifts, providing temporary legal status to individuals from countries facing extraordinary conditions. This decision creates uncertainty for many whose protections have already expired or are set to expire soon.</p>

          <p>Shares of buy-now, pay-later company Affirm surged over 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company also provided optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year, signaling continued momentum despite increased competition and the loss of Walmart as a partner. CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to growth in consumer and merchant usage, particularly through partnerships with Shopify and Amazon. The company's Affirm Card is also gaining traction, with significant growth in transaction volume and active cardholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant deal has been struck in California between Governor Gavin Newsom, legislative leaders, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. The compromise will advance a bill allowing drivers to form unions and engage in collective bargaining while maintaining their status as independent contractors. In exchange, a separate bill sponsored by the companies that reduces their insurance liability requirements will also move forward. This agreement marks a major milestone in the long-running debate over labor rights for gig economy workers in the state, balancing driver empowerment with reduced operational costs for the companies.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu's US Open run has ended after a decisive 6-1, 6-2 third-round loss to 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. Raducanu, who had shown strong form in her first two matches, was unable to counter Rybakina's powerful serves and dominant baseline game. The Kazakhstani player controlled the match from the outset, hitting with overwhelming force and depth that consistently put the British player on the defensive. This defeat highlights the significant gap Raducanu still needs to close to consistently challenge the top players in the sport, a goal she has been actively working towards.</p>

          <p>Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, has built her career researching the economic costs of discrimination and innovation gaps among women and minorities. Her work provides empirical data on how prejudice can hinder economic growth, a perspective that has been influential in her field. Despite the historical underrepresentation of Black women in economics, Cook has become a prominent figure, now at the center of a political firestorm. President Trump's attempt to remove her from her post highlights the intersection of politics, economic policy, and institutional independence.</p>

          <p>The initial summit between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump was marked by a friendly tone, easing fears of a contentious meeting. President Lee's careful preparation, which included studying Trump's negotiation style, appeared to pay off as the two leaders discussed trade and North Korea. Despite the positive atmosphere and favorable reception of a South Korean plan to invest in U.S. shipbuilding, analysts caution that it is too early to declare a diplomatic victory. Several key issues, including trade details and defense cost-sharing for U.S. troops, remain unresolved and could test the relationship going forward.</p>

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-end "trophy" ranches are being listed for sale as heirs find themselves unable to agree on the properties' futures or prefer to cash out. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory for these legacy properties, which often span thousands of acres and are on the market for the first time in generations. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a connection to nature, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. This trend reflects a broader generational transfer of wealth and the financial complexities of maintaining such large, capital-intensive real estate assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis compares California Governor Gavin Newsom's deployment of California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers to cities with President Trump's use of National Guard troops, arguing the two approaches are fundamentally different. While both actions provide a visible show of authority to deter crime, Newsom's strategy uses state police to supplement local law enforcement in targeted ways. The article contrasts this with what it calls Trump's more authoritarian military intervention. It frames the debate as one between repression and public safety, highlighting California's broader focus on law enforcement reform and rehabilitation alongside enforcement.</p>

A short-term extension had prevented any service disruption while the companies finalized the terms. This resolution avoids a blackout that would have impacted millions of subscribers, particularly with the NFL season and college football underway.</p>
