          <p>The Champlin Park Rebels won the Class AAAA Minnesota high school girls' softball championship, defeating Bloomington Jefferson 6-0, with a complete-game shutout by junior pitcher Marissa Rothenberger. Rothenberger, a trans-identifying male athlete, pitched all 21 innings in the tournament, allowing only two runs and earning a spot on the All-Tournament team. Outside the stadium, protesters gathered to express their opposition to the Minnesota State High School League's policy allowing student-athletes to compete based on gender identity. Parents from both teams expressed mixed emotions, with some celebrating the win and others questioning the fairness of the competition.</p>

          <h2>Why Trump May Find It Difficult to Sever Ties with Musk</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the recent public spat between President Trump and Elon Musk, it may be difficult for Trump to cut ties with Musk due to the US's reliance on SpaceX for space-related projects. SpaceX dominates the space launch industry and is crucial for military, intelligence, and NASA operations. Canceling contracts with SpaceX could halt ambitious projects like the National Reconnaissance Office's satellite constellation and NASA's Artemis program. Furthermore, SpaceX is a frontrunner for building the "Golden Dome" missile defense system, making Musk's involvement essential for Trump's goals.</p>

          <p>The interim government of Bangladesh announced that the next general election will be held in April 2026. This announcement follows student-led unrest in 2024 that led to the ousting of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently being tried in absentia. Opposition parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), have been demanding a clear timeline for a democratic transition and have warned of instability if the vote does not occur by December. BNP's leader, Khaleda Zia, is eligible to run in the next election after being acquitted in a 2008 corruption case.</p>

          <p>Tom Cruise has been awarded a Guinness World Record for performing the most burning parachute jumps by an individual for "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning." Cruise jumped from at least 7,500 feet with a parachute pre-soaked in fuel, which was then ignited, requiring him to cut away the burning chute and deploy a backup. He performed the stunt 16 times, sometimes while holding a 50-pound camera rig, showcasing his dedication to authenticity and pushing boundaries in action filmmaking. This is Cruise's second Guinness World Record, adding to his box office achievements.</p>

          <p>An escaped zebra named Ed has been spotted in Tennessee nearly a week after escaping its owners. Rutherford County sheriff's deputies are tracking the zebra with a drone near Christiana, aiming to calm the animal before attempting capture. The zebra, originally named Zeke, was brought to the property of Taylor and Laura Ford before escaping into a wooded area. Animal advocacy groups have criticized the situation, stating that zebras are wild animals and should not be kept as pets.</p>

This shift is driven by concerns over market volatility in the U.S. and relatively weaker performance compared to global counterparts. Financial professionals suggest that diversifying portfolios with foreign stocks is a savvy move over the long term. Adding foreign stocks can help guarantee at least some exposure to whichever side is performing better over the many years you're likely to invest. (not investment advice)</p>
