          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:24:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed bipartisan legislation to help thousands of military veterans avoid foreclosure on their homes. This bill addresses a critical gap left after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ended a previous homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer options than other homeowners. The new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on payments to move those missed payments to the end of their loan term, thus making their mortgage current. This action by Congress aims to rectify a series of administrative stumbles and provide a stable safety net for veterans facing financial hardship.</p>

          <h2>Former Vice President Pence Calls for Release of Epstein-Related Government Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:58:08 EDT</div>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly called for the Trump administration to release all government files related to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. In a direct contrast to President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a "hoax," Pence argued that the American people deserve to see the facts, while emphasizing that the names of victims must be protected. Pence's remarks underscore the deep division within the Republican party over the handling of the Epstein case. The Justice Department recently concluded its review, finding no evidence of a "client list" but identifying over 1,000 victims.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called the Base App, which aims to integrate crypto wallet, trading, payment, and social media functions into a single platform. Built on its own Base blockchain, the app is designed to expand Coinbase's reach beyond speculative crypto traders to a broader consumer market. A key feature is Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed in partnership with Shopify, which will eventually support in-store tap-to-pay. This move represents a significant effort to drive the utility of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions and create a Western equivalent to super-apps like China's WeChat.

          <p>A tsunami advisory issued for parts of southern Alaska has been canceled after a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting some coastal communities to evacuate to higher ground. However, authorities later downgraded the alert to an advisory before canceling it altogether, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected as the event occurred in shallow water. While the earthquake was felt across the region and followed by several aftershocks, there have been no reports of significant damage or injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from using high-fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. While the company has not officially confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and stated that details on new offerings would be shared soon. This potential move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for removing ingredients like corn syrup from food products. The change would align U.S. Coke with versions sold in other countries but could negatively impact American corn farmers, who are a primary source for corn syrup production.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:04:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of flat owners in the UK are planning a class-action lawsuit against the companies that own their apartment blocks, known as freeholders, over alleged secret commissions on building insurance. The legal claim asserts that freeholders received these commissions from insurers and then passed the cost on to leaseholders through inflated service charges without their knowledge or consent. Lawyers suggest that as insurance costs have soared post-Grenfell, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allowing freeholders to profit from the crisis. The lawsuit seeks the return of these fees plus interest, targeting what the claimants describe as an unlawful and non-transparent practice.</p>

          <p>The German government has committed to passing new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants to the United Kingdom. This move, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK, will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country like the UK. Currently, such an act is not technically a crime in Germany. The new law will empower German authorities to target the supply chain for small boat crossings, including warehouses used to store boats and engines, reflecting a new level of cooperation between the two nations to address the issue.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations and issued a new, more confident forecast for the full year, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that "the world is less uncertain today" than it was earlier in 2025. While quarterly revenue fell slightly short of estimates and unit revenues declined, the airline projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the year. This updated guidance comes after a rocky start to the year for the industry, which saw weaker-than-expected domestic demand. The airline's optimism signals a potential stabilization in travel demand, particularly in the premium and international sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark British study has demonstrated that creating "three-parent" babies can successfully prevent children from being born with devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases. Researchers used the technique, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children by replacing a mother's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor. The resulting babies carry the primary genetic material from their two parents, ensuring they inherit their main traits, but are free from the mother's heritable disorder. While hailed as a pioneering breakthrough, the technique remains controversial due to ethical concerns about genetic manipulation and creating "designer babies."</p>
