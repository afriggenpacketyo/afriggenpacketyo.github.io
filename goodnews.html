          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region rose despite China reporting a larger-than-expected drop in consumer prices for August, with the index falling 0.4% year-over-year. The producer price index also fell, though the decline was less severe than in previous months, suggesting some stabilization. In response to Apple's latest product launch, shares of its Asian supply chain partners, like Foxconn and Samsung, traded higher. Major indices in Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea all saw advances, indicating that investors are balancing concerns over Chinese deflation with other positive market signals.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position while her lawsuit proceeds. Trump had attempted to remove Cook "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud related to conduct that occurred before she joined the Fed board. The judge ruled that Cook has a strong case that the removal was unlawful, stating that the "for cause" provision likely applies only to a governor's behavior while in office. This decision is seen as a significant check on the president's influence over the historically independent Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team delivered a much-improved performance, defeating Japan 2-0 in a friendly match in Columbus, Ohio. Goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun secured the win, lending credibility to coach Mauricio Pochettino's strategy of experimenting with the roster ahead of the World Cup. Pochettino deployed a new 3-4-2-1 formation, giving opportunities to players who are not regular starters but could play significant roles. The victory provided a boost of confidence after a recent loss and showcased greater comfort and cohesion within the squad's tactical setup.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement aimed at resuming cooperation, including the potential relaunch of inspections at Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, announced after a meeting in Cairo, was called "a step in the right direction" by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. This development comes at a sensitive time, as European nations have threatened to reimpose UN sanctions over Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran suspended cooperation with inspectors in July after attacks on its nuclear sites, and the new framework addresses Tehran's security concerns while outlining technical requirements for future work.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, should host the 2036 Olympic Games. The proposal highlights the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network as a way to avoid the massive economic burden often associated with hosting. By utilizing established venues and the area's robust infrastructure, the region could meet the International Olympic Committee's standards for athlete accommodation and travel times. The article suggests this multi-city approach offers a sustainable and innovative model for future Olympic Games, minimizing the need for costly new construction.</p>

          <h2>Strong Rehab Performance Puts Pitcher Roki Sasaki Back in Contention for Dodgers' Postseason Roster</h2>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-emerged as a candidate for the team's postseason roster after a strong rehab start for the Triple-A affiliate. In the outing, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and threw multiple pitches over 100 mph, demonstrating a significant improvement from previous struggles. While a spot in the starting rotation is unlikely, his performance could earn him a role in the bullpen. Sasaki had been on the injured list with a shoulder impingement since mid-May, and this successful return adds another competitive arm to the Dodgers' pitching staff as they approach the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide on the legality of President Donald Trump's broad use of tariffs, setting the stage for a major test of his economic agenda. The case centers on whether the president exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose global tariffs. Lower courts have ruled against the administration, finding that the law did not grant the president unlimited power to set duties. The Trump administration argues that this authority is crucial for national security and foreign policy, while opponents claim it represents an unconstitutional overreach of executive power.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a congressional district in Northern Virginia, further tightening the Republican majority in the U.S. House to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in the reliably Democratic district. A key issue in the race was President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, which significantly impacts the district's large population of government employees. Walkinshaw's victory is being highlighted by Democrats as another example of their candidates overperforming in recent elections across the country.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged after the company released forward-looking revenue projections that left financial analysts "blown away" and "in shock." Despite missing current quarterly earnings expectations, the company forecasted massive growth in its cloud infrastructure business, projecting it to grow from $10 billion to $144 billion over the next six years. This explosive trajectory is driven by a series of new multi-billion dollar contracts, including a major deal with OpenAI to build out U.S. data center capacity. The company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted future revenue, soared to $455 billion, signaling a seismic shift in its business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new trial in the United Kingdom will offer over 1,000 people with suspected dementia a blood test for Alzheimer's disease, a development that could revolutionize diagnosis. The test detects biomarkers for the rogue amyloid and tau proteins that accumulate in the brain, and it is expected to improve diagnostic accuracy from 70% to over 90%. Currently, confirming Alzheimer's requires specialist brain scans or lumbar punctures, which are rarely used. If successful, the simple blood test could become a standard part of the diagnostic process, enabling earlier access to support and emerging treatments for the disease.</p>

The new policy is expected to provide an average annual savings of $12,000 per child for families, supporting financial stability and workforce participation.

          <p>The public bus system in Akron, Ohio, has received a national award after a major overhaul led to a 24% increase in ridership, more than triple the national average. The transit authority, METRO RTA, reinvented its service in 2023 by redesigning routes, improving frequency to every 15 minutes on key lines, and expanding to seven-day service. This transformation was based on direct feedback from passengers, with the CEO making a point to ride buses weekly to talk with customers. The success was achieved without a budget increase and is being hailed as a model for how public transit can thrive.</p>
