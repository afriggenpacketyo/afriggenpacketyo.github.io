          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention in Louisiana following a federal judge's order. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for months as the Trump administration sought to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns. Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and criticized the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. Khalil's release comes after a series of protests and discussions over free speech. The government is expected to appeal the decision, but Khalil is now able to return to his family and continue his activism. The courts have now ruled in favor of his release.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities seized 110,000 fentanyl pills and arrested three individuals, including an American citizen and a dual national with a U.S. warrant for drug dealing. The arrests were conducted by the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection and the Attorney General's Office, with participation from the FBI. The security agents located the three people after conducting ground patrols in Ciudad Ju√°rez and found the fentanyl pills inside their vehicle. These arrests are part of Mexico's effort to combat illegal drug distribution, a priority for President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Mexican government is making strides to combat the drug trade.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski, known for throwing triple-digit fastballs, made MLB history after taking a perfect game into the seventh inning in his second career start. Misiorowski became the first starting pitcher in the modern era to begin his career with 11 consecutive no-hit innings. He was pulled after issuing a walk and then allowing a home run, leaving to a standing ovation. Misiorowski is the only big leaguer since 1900 to have more wins than hits allowed in his first two career starts. Misiorowski's performance has garnered attention. The rookie is off to a strong start.</p>

          <p>French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative." The discovery was made after researchers received a blood sample from a patient undergoing routine tests. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type. Scientists were able to unravel the mystery through "high-throughput DNA sequencing," which highlighted a genetic mutation. The discovery could improve care for patients with rare blood types. There is hope for new treatments.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that global population estimates may be underrepresenting rural areas by a significant margin. Researchers analyzed data from 300 rural dam projects across 35 countries and found discrepancies with other population datasets. The study claims that rural populations have been underestimated by 53% to 84% between 1975 and 2010. Some experts are skeptical, stating that a few billion more inhabitants is unlikely. More research is needed to confirm these findings. The true numbers are still unknown.</p>
