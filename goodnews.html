        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is actively pursuing a deal with the EU to allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency. The minister also expressed optimism about securing a youth mobility scheme and lowering food prices through reduced trade red tape. However, Conservative MP Alex Burghart voiced concerns that the proposed agreement could lead to the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by adhering to EU standards without having a say in future decisions. Liberal Democrat MP Calum Miller urged the government to pursue a customs union with the EU, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticized potential deals on youth mobility and fishing rights as a betrayal of Brexit.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books, known as the Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, have been repatriated to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States, marking the end of their 79-year journey abroad. Dating back to the Warring States Period, these manuscripts are considered the oldest ancient classics ever found in China. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts after the Smithsonian published a new ethical returns policy.

          <p>Haas F1 Team has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, arguing that the lap was completed before a red flag was issued due to a crash. Despite television footage and live-timing data appearing to support Bearman's claim, the FIA maintains that the red flag was initiated before he crossed the finish line. Bearman expressed his frustration, stating that the red light on his dash appeared after he crossed the line and that the decision seemed unfair. The FIA delayed the start of Qualifying Two to consult with timing experts, ultimately upholding their initial ruling.</p>

          <p>Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, has achieved a significant milestone by successfully completing the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule. Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the mission demonstrated Europe's ability to develop independent space return capabilities. The capsule completed a full trip around Earth before deploying an inflatable heat shield during reentry and splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean. This achievement opens doors for greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field of commercial space logistics and could lead to new opportunities for microgravity research and in-space manufacturing.</p>
