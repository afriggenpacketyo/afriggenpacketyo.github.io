          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:57:30 EDT</div>

          <p>The chairman of the Washington, D.C. city council has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving forward despite President Trump's recent threats to block it. The president had demanded the team revert to its former "Redskins" name, a move the council chairman dismissed as a "distraction." The proposed agreement, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, still requires council votes and faces challenges related to the transfer of the federal land. However, the deal appears to have widespread local political and resident support for bringing the team back to the district.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is not returned to sender but is instead sent digitally to a unique facility in Salt Lake City. At this Remote Encoding Center, hundreds of "data conversion operators" work around the clock to manually decipher millions of hard-to-read addresses each day. These specialists, who can process around 900 items per hour, play a crucial role in ensuring that even the most illegibly addressed letters and packages reach their intended destinations.

          <p>The 2026 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina is taking shape, as sources report that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper both plan to run for the open seat. Whatley is expected to announce his campaign in the coming days with the endorsement of President Trump, following Lara Trump's decision not to enter the race. Cooper, a popular former governor, is anticipated to declare his candidacy for the Democrats next week. The contest for the seat, being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis, is expected to be a major national battleground.</p>

          <p>Desmond Watson, a rookie defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and reportedly the heaviest player in NFL history, has been placed on the non-football injury list to begin training camp. The team's coach, Todd Bowles, stated the reason was Watson's weight and that the goal is to help him become healthier and more able to play. Watson, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, has been working with a team nutritionist to reach a more ideal playing weight. The team has not set a specific target weight or a timetable for his return to the field.</p>

          <p>In response to increased immigration enforcement, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to parishioners afraid to leave their homes. The Family Assistance Program aims to support vulnerable members of its community who fear being arrested and deported. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many targeted immigrants are hard-working contributors to the economy who are now living in fear. The initiative builds on existing parish networks and has already received significant donations, including a $50,000 contribution from businessman Rick Caruso.</p>

          <p>Four traders convicted of manipulating the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeals follow a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a related case. The men were all convicted as part of a wide-ranging investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the rate-rigging scandal that was central to the 2008 financial crisis. Given the new legal precedent set by the Supreme Court, the four traders' appeals are expected to be a more straightforward process.</p>

          <p>According to this analysis, the 2028 Democratic presidential primary has unofficially begun, with potential candidates like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom making strategic media appearances on a wide range of podcasts and shows. These appearances are seen as an attempt to reach new voters and signal a rhetorical shift toward the political center, with some candidates openly criticizing the party for being "too extreme." This early positioning is not just for voters but also for donors and party elites to begin assessing the field in what is seen as a necessary course correction after the 2024 election loss.</p>

          <p>This article examines Realty Income, a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) known as a "Dividend Aristocrat" for its consistent history of dividend growth. The company maintains a high occupancy rate of 98.5% and focuses on tenants in recession-resistant sectors like grocery and wholesale clubs, with over 90% of its retail rent coming from essential service providers. The firm is also expanding its portfolio in Europe to diversify its income streams. Analysts give the stock a "Moderate Buy" consensus rating, suggesting it is a compelling option for investors who prioritize steady, passive income over high growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not spending too much on artificial intelligence, but are in fact "underspending." He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and continued investment is crucial for success. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and necessary. He believes the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive financial outlays. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As regulators like the U.S. FDA begin to ban or phase out artificial food colorings such as Red Dye No. 3, technology and food science companies are racing to develop natural alternatives. Firms are exploring sources like microalgae and specially grown carrots and potatoes to create stable, vivid pigments that can replace synthetic dyes in food and drinks. While these natural colors can be more expensive to produce, the cost impact on the final product is minimal. Food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to phase out artificial colors, facing the challenge of reformulating iconic products without losing consumer appeal.</p>

The lawsuit names the former state's attorney, who was disbarred over his misconduct and is now deceased, and several detectives. Huffington, who has already received state compensation, said the wrongful conviction cost him his family and decades of his life.</p>
