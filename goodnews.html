        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with softened tariffs on China, the company may soon be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs are impeding Walmart's ability to maintain low prices for customers, despite the recent reduction in tariff rates on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days. Rising cost pressures from tariffs, particularly on goods from China like electronics and toys, are impacting the retailer. Walmart will try to absorb some costs but anticipates price hikes later this month and has pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker, is introducing a crime plan that aims to enhance public safety through a combination of strategies. The plan includes initiatives to create hiring and retention incentives for police officers, alongside investments in diversion programs designed to address the root causes of crime. This approach reflects a balanced strategy, incorporating both law enforcement and community-based solutions to reduce crime rates. Adams had previously opposed calls to reduce the size of the Police Department, demonstrating her commitment to maintaining a strong police presence while also exploring alternative approaches.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House proposes making Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while adding new reductions, including eliminating taxes on overtime pay. The bill would provide an average $1,300 tax reduction, including a new $4,000 deduction for those 65 and older with income limits, and increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers. It also extends and increases the Child Tax Credit, eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule, increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses, and allows car loan interest to be deducted. Democrats oppose the bill for its cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and some tax cuts expire after 2028.</p>

          <p>Doctors have successfully treated a baby with a rare genetic disorder using a gene-editing therapy tailored to his specific mutation. The treatment, involving infusions of microscopic gene-editors, appears to have partially reversed the condition, reducing the risk of brain damage. This personalized approach offers hope for treating other rare genetic diseases that lack commercial incentives for pharmaceutical development. While further research is needed, this case represents a significant step towards personalized medicine and the potential for transformative treatments for rare diseases, with the hope of expanding access to genetic cures on demand.</p>

          <p>For taxpayers struggling with unpaid IRS tax debt, several tax relief options are available. These include installment agreements, penalty relief, Offers in Compromise, Currently Not Collectible status, and filing or amending tax returns. Installment agreements allow taxpayers to pay over time, while penalty relief may reduce what is owed. Offers in Compromise can settle debt for less than the full amount, and Currently Not Collectible status temporarily halts collection activities. Acting now is crucial to prevent further penalties and collection actions. (not investment advice)</p>
