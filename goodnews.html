          <p>England selector Luke Wright has refrained from confirming Ollie Pope's position as the number three batsman for the upcoming Test series against India, despite Pope's recent century. The inclusion of Jacob Bethell in the squad adds another dimension to the selection dilemma, with Bethell having previously batted at number three in New Zealand. Wright emphasized that various factors, including conditions and past performances, will be considered before a final decision is made closer to the match. Bethell's impressive performances, including half-centuries in New Zealand and a recent strong showing against West Indies, have made him a strong contender for the spot. The final lineup will be announced two days before the Test. The presence of depth in the squad is seen as a positive issue for the team. The article suggests the selectors are carefully evaluating all options before making a final decision. The situation is complex and it is not clear who will be selected.

          <p>A Harvard University report indicates that the United States continues to lead China in critical technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, semiconductors, space, and quantum computing.

While other indexes point to China's leading research output, this report emphasizes the importance of financial resources in quantifying the global tech race. The Critical and Emerging Technologies Index places considerable weight on funding, an area where the US maintains an advantage.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that NATO is likely to increase its defense spending target to 5% of member nations' GDP, echoing President Trump's demand. This announcement comes ahead of a larger NATO summit where defense capabilities will be discussed. The 5% target is composed of 3.5% for pure defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While defense spending has increased among NATO members since Trump's previous term, some major economies still lag below the 2% GDP threshold. Military analysts emphasize the importance of maintaining defense spending at 5% to address threats from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The article does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>While best friendships can be a source of joy and support for children, experts say they are not essential for healthy development. Children with best friends tend to be less anxious and better at handling rejection, but the pressure to have a best friend can also be stressful. Experts suggest that children need a repertoire of anchors, or supportive relationships, rather than a single best friend. It is important for children to have people they can rely on for different things. Having a strong support system is more important than having a best friend.</p>
