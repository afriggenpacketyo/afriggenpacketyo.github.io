          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The lessons, which cover reading UV levels and applying sunscreen, are planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, supported by the charity Melanoma Fund. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, making early education a key preventative measure against the rising rates of the disease.</p>
