          <p>A federal judge has issued a partial restraining order to prevent the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The judge cited a lack of credible evidence for an organized rebellion and expressed concern that the deployment would escalate civil unrest rather than quell it. The ruling came after Illinois' Attorney General filed a lawsuit arguing the deployment was unlawful and unconstitutional. The judge found the administration's justification for the deployment to be unreliable and noted that local law enforcement has affirmed its ability to handle the situation.</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Aniston is speaking out against long-standing rumors that she chose her career over having children, labeling her as "selfish." She revealed that for years she was privately undergoing challenging IVF treatments in an attempt to start a family, a struggle the public was unaware of. Aniston explained she wrote a 2016 op-ed to counter the hurtful narrative and support other women facing similar fertility issues. She expressed frustration with the media's focus on her maternal status and now feels a sense of relief, having moved past that chapter of her life.</p>

The statement follows rumors that the university was exploring options to part ways with Belichick after a 2-3 start and reports of recruiting violations, a divided locker room, and poor communication. Despite the team's struggles and internal complaints about a lack of structure, both Belichick and the athletic director expressed full support for each other. The program is now focused on turning things around during Belichick's first year.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times Media Group, which includes the newspaper, a gaming company, and a digital studio, has announced it is taking steps to become a publicly traded company. Chairman Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong aims to raise up to $500 million to ensure the company's financial sustainability while maintaining its core journalistic mission. The process will begin with a private placement for large investors, followed by a public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The move comes as the newspaper, like many legacy media outlets, faces financial challenges and is in the midst of lengthy contract negotiations with its employee guild.</p>

          <p>Following England's dominant 3-0 friendly victory over Wales, manager Thomas Tuchel expressed his disappointment with the lack of energy from the home crowd at Wembley Stadium. Despite his team scoring three goals in the first 20 minutes, Tuchel felt the atmosphere was "silent" and did not match the players' strong performance on the field. He noted that the visiting Wales fans were more audible for long stretches of the game. Tuchel's comments have sparked a debate among fans and pundits about the atmosphere at national team games held at the iconic venue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant agreement between Israel and Hamas to implement the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan. He described the deal as a "momentous breakthrough" and stated that all remaining Israeli hostages are expected to be released early next week. The initial phase involves an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza. While Trump celebrated the achievement as a step towards "everlasting peace," details about subsequent phases, such as the future governance of Gaza and long-term security guarantees, remain unclear.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was scheduled to die for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. Roberson's defense has long argued his innocence, presenting new medical evidence suggesting the child died from pneumonia, not "shaken baby syndrome" as prosecutors claimed. The court has ordered a review of the case under a Texas law that allows convictions to be challenged if the science used to obtain them is later discredited. The ruling marks a significant development in a case that has drawn attention to the evolving scientific understanding of child injuries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar's highly successful diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the track's controversial lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted opinion within the context of a rap battle and were not assertions of fact. Drake's lawsuit had alleged that UMG, the parent label for both artists, promoted the track despite its false allegations, thereby damaging his reputation. UMG praised the dismissal as a victory for creative expression in a statement following the ruling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China is fostering an integrated electric vehicle (EV) industry across Asia through strategic investments and technology sharing, particularly in Southeast Asia. Rather than a zero-sum competition, Chinese firms like BYD and CATL are establishing factories and joint ventures in countries such as Indonesia and Thailand. This collaborative approach, which leverages local resources with Chinese expertise, contrasts sharply with the protectionist tariffs and decoupling efforts seen in the West. The article suggests that this pragmatic integration is building a resilient and interconnected EV supply chain throughout the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the key factors that enabled President Trump to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas where previous efforts had failed. The article credits Trump's close personal relationships with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders in the Arab world, allowing him to exert unique pressure. A pivotal moment was an Israeli airstrike in Qatar, which reportedly prompted Trump to issue an ultimatum to stop the war. This combination of personal diplomacy, leveraging business ties with Gulf states, and capitalizing on a moment when Israel's strategic objectives were met, proved decisive in securing the agreement.</p>

The denim company's gross margin improved, and it has successfully raised prices on some items without seeing a drop in consumer demand. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the company will continue this surgical approach to pricing in the coming year. As a result of the strong performance, Levi's has raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook, signaling confidence despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

His work in the 1980s at UC Berkeley, alongside his co-laureates, proved that quantum tunneling was possible with large objects, a discovery that now underpins the entire field. Martinis, who later led a team at Google to build an experimental quantum processor, credits the collaborative and advanced research environment within the University of California system for his success.

          <p>President Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman to again discuss his potential nomination to lead NASA. This comes months after Trump pulled Isaacman's initial nomination, citing his past political donations and close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Tensions between Trump and Musk have since cooled, apparently reopening the door for Isaacman, the founder of Shift4 and leader of two private spaceflights. The discussions occur as NASA faces significant challenges, including proposed budget cuts and staffing reductions resulting from a government efficiency initiative led by Musk.</p>
