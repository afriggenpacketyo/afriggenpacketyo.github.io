          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing legislation to prevent hostile foreign powers, such as China, Iran, and Russia, from purchasing land within the state that could pose a national security threat. Senate Bill 17 aims to block entities affiliated with these governments from acquiring real estate, including agricultural, commercial, and residential land. The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and reverse land deals that pose risks to public health or safety, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. This Fox News article highlights the state's efforts to safeguard against foreign espionage and influence through real estate acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, driven by generous tax incentives and lower labor costs.
