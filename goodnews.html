          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has announced significant progress in prosecuting a massive $250 million fraud case in Minnesota. The scheme involved exploiting a federally funded child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic, with conspirators falsely claiming to have served millions of meals to children. So far, 70 individuals have been indicted, with 38 pleading guilty to using the funds for personal luxuries like mansions and cars. The investigation remains ongoing, with officials expecting additional charges to be filed.</p>

          <p>Ten American citizens, including a former Navy SEAL, have been freed from detention in Venezuela and are returning to the United States. Their release was part of a complex prisoner exchange agreement involving the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador. The deal also saw the release of dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. In exchange, El Salvador transferred 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and accused of gang ties, back to Venezuela, resolving a contentious diplomatic situation.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, previously deported from the U.S. to a high-security prison in El Salvador, have been sent to Venezuela. This move was a key component of a multi-nation deal that also secured the release of American citizens and political prisoners held by the Maduro regime. The migrants had been controversially deported under the Alien Enemies Act, with many denying the U.S. government's claims of gang affiliation. The ACLU has criticized the maneuver, suggesting it is an attempt to avoid judicial accountability for the initial detentions.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually undertaking a mission to Mars. This support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also indicates that the 1969 moon landing is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement and a source of national pride. These positive sentiments about space exploration generally transcend partisan and ideological divides across the country.</p>

          <p>The newly appointed Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated he does not support privatizing the U.S. Postal Service, aiming to quell concerns raised by his background as a former CEO of a competitor. In his first message to employees, Steiner affirmed his belief in the USPS's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity within the executive branch. While he plans to assess and modify the controversial "Delivering for America" plan, his public stance has provided some reassurance to union leaders. This comes amidst ongoing bipartisan opposition in Congress to the idea of privatizing the mail agency.</p>

          <p>The price of the cryptocurrency Ether has risen significantly, reaching levels not seen since January, following President Trump signing the GENIUS Act into law. This legislation marks the first major crypto-focused law in the U.S., establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. On Thursday, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ether saw higher net inflows than Bitcoin ETFs for the first time, signaling a potential shift in market momentum. Analysts suggest the new law provides crucial regulatory clarity and symbolism, potentially embedding stablecoins more deeply into the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix's recent strong quarterly performance, which saw a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, is being interpreted as a positive indicator for Disney's streaming ambitions. Netflix's success with price hikes and its ad-supported tier suggests that consumers are willing to pay for premium content, a strategy Disney is also pursuing. This demonstrates a viable path for major streaming platforms to grow revenue through both subscriptions and advertising without significant subscriber loss. Analysts believe this bodes well for Disney's upcoming earnings report, as the company focuses on making its direct-to-consumer services profitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil development. Exxon stated that while it disagrees with the ruling, it respects the arbitration process and will welcome Chevron to the joint venture. The resolution removes significant uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-earning neurosurgeon who sued for £14 million after a snowmobile crash had his case dismissed by London's High Court. The surgeon claimed his injuries from crashing into a tree during a McLaren-hosted trip in Lapland diminished his earning capacity. However, the judge ruled that the surgeon caused the crash himself by accidentally hitting the gas instead of the brake. The decision was heavily influenced by a text message the surgeon sent to McLaren staff post-accident, in which he wrote, "It was my error and my responsibility."</p>

          <p>American Express reported that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with total card spending up 7% in the second quarter. This trend has largely insulated the company from concerns about a broader economic slowdown. However, a notable exception was in travel, where spending on domestic economy class airfare has stalled and remained flat compared to last year. In contrast, spending on premium cabin flights and luxury hotels saw healthy increases, indicating that while wealthy consumers are still traveling, they are spending less on basic domestic flights.
