          <p>In March, China decreased its holdings of US Treasuries, relinquishing its position as the second-largest foreign holder before the trade war with the US intensified. According to data from the US Department of the Treasury, China's stockpile fell to $765.4 billion, a decrease of $18.9 billion from the previous month, while Britain increased its holdings to $779.3 billion, becoming America‚Äôs second-largest foreign creditor. This adjustment occurred before US government bonds experienced significant volatility in April following President Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement. Moody‚Äôs Ratings also downgraded the US government's credit rating, further influencing Treasury bond yields.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, which would allow young people to work in other countries for up to two years. This proposal aims to allow young people to move abroad for a limited time, but details on age eligibility and caps are yet to be determined. While the UK already has reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia, allowing young people to work in each other's countries, some Conservative Party members have criticized the potential scheme as "free movement through the back door." The first formal summit for European leaders since Brexit will be held in London's Lancaster House.</p>

          <p>A top advisor to the director of national intelligence allegedly ordered a senior analyst to revise an intelligence assessment regarding the relationship between Venezuela‚Äôs government and the Tren de Aragua gang, after initial findings contradicted the White House's justification for deporting migrants. President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, claiming Venezuela directed the gang's criminal activities in the US. The New York Times article reports that the National Intelligence Council reaffirmed its original findings after re-examining evidence, despite pressure from a political appointee to alter the narrative. The controversy has led to internal anger and accusations of politicizing intelligence reports.</p>

A DW Fact Check analyzes studies by the BBC and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, which found significant shortcomings in AI's ability to accurately convey news reporting. The studies revealed factual errors, altered quotes, and fabricated links, with the AI tools often presenting incorrect answers with alarming confidence.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture as part of its restructuring plans, according to a company source. The plants being considered for closure are Nissan's main Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of its subsidiary Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which together account for about 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision remains uncertain as discussions with labor unions, parts makers, and municipalities have not yet taken place. This follows Nissan's announcement that it will shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after reporting a net loss for fiscal year 2024.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's ambitious plan for widespread US tariffs, dubbed "liberation day," lasted only 40 days, causing significant market volatility and economic disruption. The article describes the initial shock and subsequent reversals, including a 90-day pause on tariffs and exemptions for key products. While the administration attempted to portray the changes as part of a strategic negotiation, the moves were largely driven by concerns over economic fallout and consumer sentiment.

          <p>The article draws parallels between President Trump's proposed "one big, beautiful bill" and Ronald Reagan's 1981 federal budget, which marked a significant shift in federal fiscal policy. Both initiatives used budget reconciliation to enact substantial changes, including tax cuts and increased military spending. Just as Reagan's program aimed to stimulate the economy through tax cuts, Trump's bill seeks to reshape the federal government, with Elon Musk playing a key role in cutting costs and improving government efficiency. The success of Trump's efforts will depend on his ability to navigate the reconciliation process and garner support in Congress.</p>
