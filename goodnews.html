          <p>Taiwan has shut down its last operating nuclear power reactor, marking the end of four decades of nuclear energy production on the island. The closure aligns with the government's policy to phase out nuclear power, a decision influenced by the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, questions remain about whether Taiwan can successfully achieve its goal of transitioning to alternative energy sources. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ended operations as the self-ruled island moves to phase out nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster.</p>
