          <p>Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion. The announcement was celebrated by President Trump at the White House, who framed it as a step toward ensuring iPhones are made in America. The move is seen as an effort by Apple to avoid the administration's threatened tariffs, which could significantly impact the company's costs due to its reliance on a global supply chain for producing its popular devices.</p>

          <p>After losing their family home in the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, David and Jacquie Israel decided to embark on a cross-country adventure in an RV. For over 10 weeks, the couple has been traveling across the U.S., finding the experience of meeting new people and seeing the country's beauty to be profoundly healing. They say the journey has shown them a different side of America, one defined by kindness and connection rather than the division often seen in the news, reminding them the country is filled with beautiful people.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to tighten regulations on the non-surgical cosmetics industry to protect consumers from harm. Under the new proposals, risky procedures like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals, and clinics offering Botox and fillers will need to acquire licenses. The plan also includes age restrictions to protect minors from dangerous social media beauty trends. While the industry has welcomed the move, the specific details will be determined after further consultation, and implementation could take several years.</p>

          <p>The signing of South Korean superstar Son Heung-min is a strategic move by LAFC that extends far beyond the field, positioning the club to significantly expand its global brand. This article argues that Son, similar to Shohei Ohtani's effect on the Dodgers, provides a direct connection to a massive international fanbase, particularly in South Korea. While he is expected to be one of the league's top players, his greatest value may be in elevating LAFC's international profile, building on the local foundation established by its first star, Carlos Vela.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they slightly miss their required grades. This is attributed to universities seeking the financial stability offered by domestic students amid uncertainty around international enrollment numbers. As universities become more competitive for UK applicants, they are making more offers, which is expected to translate into more direct acceptances and fewer available spots in the clearing process.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence suggests a "precarious and grey agglomeration," akin to a camp, formed among the debris, lasting until the 5th century. It is believed that some survivors who could not afford to relocate, along with others seeking shelter, resettled the area, living in the upper floors of buried homes. This discovery challenges the long-held perception that the city was completely abandoned immediately after its destruction.</p>
