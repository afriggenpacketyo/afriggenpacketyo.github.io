        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily ruled against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the president overstepped his authority. The order mandates the return of control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stated that the courts have the authority to review a president's decision on the necessity of the National Guard, distinguishing it from a monarchy. California officials argued that local law enforcement was managing protests effectively, and the military deployment escalated tensions, therefore the judge sided with the state of California. The optimism score is based on the tone of the article which is more stable than panic.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This discovery challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, which is part of what is now called the Middle East. The findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The optimism score is relatively high due to the positive nature of historical discovery and academic advancement.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion to ensure survival in the face of US tariffs. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned overseas capacity expansion. Executives emphasize that localizing production abroad is essential for long-term viability due to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs.

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy that delivers toxic drugs inside cancer cells, halting the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments. This advanced form of chemotherapy hits cancer with a bigger dose while reducing side effects. Paul Silvester, one of the first patients, describes the therapy as "life-changing," allowing him to spend more time with family and plan future adventures. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies, marking a significant advancement in myeloma treatment.
