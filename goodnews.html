          <p>Lowe's reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by increased demand for home projects and strategic acquisitions aimed at expanding its business with home professionals. The retailer announced an $8.8 billion deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a distributor for large residential and commercial professionals, building on an earlier acquisition of Artisan Design Group. Despite a slight revision to its full-year earnings per share outlook, Lowe's raised its total sales forecast, signaling confidence in its growth strategy. Shares rose following the announcement, contrasting with rival Home Depot's recent sales miss, as both companies focus on the more lucrative professional customer segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of August 20, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are 6.64% and 15-year rates are 5.82%, with refinance rates slightly higher. While current rates are elevated compared to a few years ago, the article suggests that potential relief may come if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. To secure the best possible rates, borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders. Understanding loan terms, fees, and locking in rates are crucial steps for both new homebuyers and those considering refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>
