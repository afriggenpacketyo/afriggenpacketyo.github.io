          <p>A New York court ruled that President Trump's blanket import taxes were illegal, but an appeals court temporarily paused the ruling. The tariffs do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are the UK's primary exports to the US. While the UK has negotiated a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, it has not yet been implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's 10% blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision. This uncertainty in international trade makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest with confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Saltmarshes Found Vital for Climate Change Mitigation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" for climate-warming greenhouse gases. The report emphasizes that saltmarshes lock away these gases in layers of mud, acting as natural flood defenses. WWF is advocating for the inclusion of these habitats in the UK's official inventory of carbon emissions and removals. The UK has lost a significant portion of its saltmarshes since 1860 due to agricultural conversion, highlighting the need for restoration and protection efforts. These muddy areas are just as important for climate mitigation as trees are.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated deliberations on legislation that would allow married couples to retain different surnames, a topic that has not been formally debated in 28 years. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three bills submitted by opposition parties appears unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A Kyodo News poll indicated that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system, reflecting a shift in public opinion.</p>

The park anticipates more births during its "baby season" and works with organizations to protect wild Barbary macaques in Morocco and Algeria.

This dismissal marks a symbolic end to an aggressive crypto crackdown in the U.S., coinciding with efforts from the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for the industry.
