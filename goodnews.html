        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the enduring power of young adult novels, using the 50th anniversary of Judy Blume's groundbreaking book "Forever" as a touchstone. It highlights how such books provide a crucial space for teenagers to see their own anxieties and desires reflected, validating feelings that are often difficult to articulate. By depicting topics like sexuality from a female perspective, these novels served as a rite of passage for many, offering a chance to imagine future possibilities and feel understood. The article celebrates the unique and formative role that art discovered during adolescence can play in a person's life.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Davis broke significant barriers in the 1960s, entering an industry dominated by white men and becoming a trusted and unflappable voice in Bay Area news. Throughout her career, she covered major historical events, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a courageous mentor who opened doors for a new generation of journalists.</p>

          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. Potter was sacked after only eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table. Nuno, who was recently let go by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to their highest league finish in decades last season, is tasked with improving the team's performance immediately. His appointment marks a shift in managerial style for the club, with observers noting his approach is more akin to former manager David Moyes.</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and went on to serve in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. armed forces, celebrated for their courage and skill in the face of systemic racism. After retiring from the Air Force, Hardy became a dedicated champion of their legacy, which was formally recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month. His income is sourced from VA disability, the GI Bill, and part-time work, which he finds is more than enough to live an upper-middle-class lifestyle in the country. Ryan contrasts the high-pressure, survival-mode existence he felt in the U.S. with the calmer, more fulfilling life in Vietnam, where lower living costs allow him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than financial strain.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor, arguing the timing is right for the company to be acquired. After a previous activist campaign led to the divestiture of its European and Latin American businesses, Clear Channel is now a more attractive U.S. pure-play, yet its stock has underperformed. Anson suggests that a sale is a better path forward for shareholders than a slow, costly standalone restructuring, given the company's significant debt and slow digital transformation.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a key solution to the U.S. housing affordability crisis. By manufacturing homes in a factory setting, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut delivery times in half compared to traditional on-site construction. The company recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 modular homes in two months for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires. This approach aims to make homeownership more attainable for essential workers and others priced out of the current market.</p>

          <p>To effectively manage workplace conflicts and gain influence, communication experts suggest memorizing key phrases to use during difficult conversations. For initiating a tough talk, phrases like "I'm seeking clarity" can reduce defensiveness, while acknowledging awkwardness can foster a problem-solving atmosphere. When approached with a problem, asking "What does success look like?" helps align goals before offering solutions. During a disagreement, leading with empathy by saying "It makes sense that you feel that way" can de-escalate tension and validate the other person's perspective, fostering a more collaborative resolution.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and writer whose life was shaped by major 20th-century events, has died at the age of 103. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna, he fled the Nazis at 16, later joining the U.S. Army and serving as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He became famous in Europe for his unconventional television interviews with cultural icons like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen, developing a sensitive and subjective style that became a model for other journalists. Troller viewed his work as a form of self-healing from the trauma he had endured.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread user fatigue with swiping culture, major dating apps like Bumble and those owned by Match Group and Meta are integrating AI to act as a more sophisticated matchmaker. These new systems aim to pair users based on deeper values and goals rather than superficial profile details, with some even using AI chatbots to facilitate initial interactions. However, skepticism remains, as past attempts at algorithmic matchmaking have shown limited success. The fundamental unpredictability of human chemistry presents a significant challenge that even advanced AI may not be able to solve.</p>

However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in spreading Chinese political ideology, interfering with academic freedom at host universities, and creating a dependency that may serve China's economic and resource interests on the continent.</p>

          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is developing and testing new cockpit alert systems designed to give pilots more time to react to hazards at airports. The technology, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide both visual and aural warnings of potential collisions, such as another aircraft being on the runway during landing or takeoff. While not yet required by regulators, the alerts are being adopted by some major airlines like Southwest and Alaska, who see the technology as a crucial additional layer of safety.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors, to argue for a robust defense of the First Amendment. The author recounts the painful dilemma faced by the ACLU, whose lawyer, David Goldberger, defended the group's right to speak despite his own Jewish heritage. The article posits that denying speech because it is offensive creates a dangerous precedent, allowing officials to suppress any expression they dislike. It concludes that free speech is most critical when protecting views with which we vehemently disagree.</p>
