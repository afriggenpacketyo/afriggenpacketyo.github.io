          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is preparing to unveil new plans to reduce UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The new laws, expected in an immigration white paper next week, will likely include skills investment requirements for employers seeking overseas workers, visa restrictions for nationalities with high asylum claim rates, and extended waiting periods for permanent residency. Additionally, the white paper may contain tougher English language requirements and highlight recent rules affecting international care worker recruitment. The government is also reviewing how the "right to family life" is applied in immigration cases, potentially leading to further changes in the immigration framework.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has hailed the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations. The agreement reduces or eliminates tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While the UK's Digital Services Tax was discussed, it was not abolished as part of the deal. Mandelson emphasized the positive relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, noting their shared commitment to defending their respective national interests. Other ambassadors in Washington have expressed envy at the UK's successful negotiation of the trade deal.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically working to make the world reliant on China's exports and technological know-how. Since 2020, he has directed the central bank to lend billions to industrial borrowers and implemented export controls on critical minerals. China's goal is to dominate global supply chains and deter other countries from using tariffs or cutting off supplies. This strategy has allowed China to respond aggressively to President Trump's tariffs, weaponizing its supply chain and challenging the United States' supremacy. However, this approach has also strained relationships with trading partners and imposed costs on Chinese households.</p>
