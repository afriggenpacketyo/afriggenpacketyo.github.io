          <p>Music superstar Mariah Carey is releasing "Here for It All," her first studio album in seven years, a project shaped by personal loss and creative renewal. The album was developed while Carey was mourning the deaths of her mother and estranged sister, who passed away on the same day last year. In a recent interview, she described the period as extremely difficult but also spoke of finding healing in her final moments with her mother. The new album is described as having a classic yet fresh sound, featuring collaborations with artists like Anderson .Paak.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 as New York City's first-ever "rat czar," has resigned from her position. Her tenure was marked by a high-profile effort to combat the city's estimated three million rats, utilizing a $3.5 million budget for public awareness and mitigation strategies, including rodent birth control. While initial data showed a decrease in rat-related complaints to the city's 311 service, her departure leaves the future of the ambitious pest control program in question. Adams has stated that the city's efforts to reduce its rodent population will continue unabated.</p>

          <p>Shares for Vancouver-based Lithium Americas surged over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the company. The proposal comes as the miner renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a major future source of lithium. This move represents a continued White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains, which are vital for technologies like electric vehicle batteries. The potential deal would exchange more favorable loan repayment terms for a small government equity stake to reduce taxpayer risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. saw a significant and unexpected increase of 20.5% in August, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This surge occurred despite mortgage rates being relatively high during the month, surprising many economists and analysts. Some experts suggest the large jump may be an anomaly due to the report's small sample size and large margin of error, though they agree the general direction is positive. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes, while homebuilders continue to offer price cuts and incentives to attract buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emergency officials on Maui conducted door-to-door evacuations and sounded sirens as a wildfire spread near the north shore town of Paia. The fire, which grew to over 100 acres, prompted alerts warning of a dangerous threat to life and property, causing fear among residents still mindful of last year's devastating Lahaina fire. However, as firefighters worked to contain the blaze, the immediate threat receded, and evacuation orders were lifted later in the day. Unlike the 2023 disaster, high winds were not a major factor, though the area is surrounded by similarly dry brush.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has achieved a major milestone, reaching 3 billion monthly active users. This places the photo-sharing app, which Meta acquired for $1 billion in 2012, in the same user-base echelon as the company's other flagship platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. The last publicly disclosed figure for Instagram was 2 billion monthly users in October 2022. The growth underscores the platform's enduring popularity and its central role in Meta's family of social media applications, which collectively serve a significant portion of the global population.</p>

          <p>A financial advice column addresses the case of a 55-year-old man facing a layoff with $1 million in cryptocurrency and over $1 million in retirement accounts, but who has not filed taxes in 20 years. The advice strongly urges him to immediately hire a CPA to resolve the tax issue with the IRS, noting that while penalties exist, the agency typically prioritizes the last six years of returns. The column also discusses retirement strategies, including using the IRS's "rule of 55" for penalty-free 401(k) withdrawals and managing a portfolio with volatile crypto assets.

          <p>In an effort to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck, Ford Motor is offering special financing rates to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. This promotion provides lower interest rates, usually reserved for buyers with higher credit ratings, to make the vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory levels. While such programs can increase sales, they also carry risks, as borrowers with lower scores are more likely to default on loans. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it deems creditworthy and that the move is part of a national program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered a massive and mysterious object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from quantum fluctuations just after the Big Bang, predating any stars. While further observation is needed to verify the object's nature, its existence could force a significant revision of our understanding of how cosmic structures evolved after the universe began.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady has addressed criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a lead analyst for Fox Sports. Some critics argue that his broadcasting job, which grants him access to other teams' players and coaches, creates a conflict of interest and an unfair advantage for the Raiders. In his newsletter, Brady dismissed these concerns as products of paranoia and distrust, stating that he has a "moral and ethical duty" to the sport. He asserted that the intersection of his passions is not a point of conflict but a position from which he can help improve the game.</p>

The primary mission, NASA's Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), will study the protective bubble around our solar system and give about a 30-minute heads-up on solar events, crucial for protecting astronauts. The other satellites will focus on Earth's outer atmosphere and provide continuous forecasting of the sun's activity.

The current 11-year, $111 billion deal runs through the 2033 season, but the rapidly changing media landscape provides an incentive for both the NFL and its partners to secure a new long-term agreement sooner. An earlier deal could inject billions more into the league, potentially increasing team valuations and the player salary cap, while giving media companies extended control over the nation's most valuable television content.

Commercial clients in an early access program can now choose to use Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 model for certain tasks, with Microsoft indicating that Anthropic's models will bring more powerful experiences to Copilot in the future.

          <p>Avani Yaltho, a high school senior from Houston, has won the grand prize in NPR's Student Podcast Challenge for her entry, "The Things We Buried." The podcast is a moving exploration of the cultural and communal changes in her grandparents' home state of Kerala, India, over the last few decades. Through interviews with her family, she contrasts their childhood of shared resources, like community mango trees, with the modern, more individualistic landscape shaped by urbanization and globalization. The narrative reflects on what is lost as generations move away from their ancestral homes in search of new opportunities.</p>
