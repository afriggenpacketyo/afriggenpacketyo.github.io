          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to its lowest point since 1939. This trend is accompanied by a growing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The article highlights that this decline is particularly pronounced and beneficial among underage individuals, where drinking rates have plummeted over the last few decades. While acknowledging a potential link to a broader decline in social activities, the overall shift is presented as a significant public health victory.</p>

          <p>Actress Margaret Qualley shared an amusing anecdote about trying to play matchmaker for her mother, Andie MacDowell, with actor Bill Murray. During an appearance on "The Tonight Show," Qualley described a backstage encounter where she learned Murray and her mother both live in Charleston. Her plan was complicated when Murray revealed that he and MacDowell didn't get along well during the filming of their 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." Despite this, Qualley expressed hope that their shared history and single status could spark a romance, humorously urging Murray to connect with her.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. The storm's current path is projected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, bringing heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. While tropical storm watches are in effect for several islands, forecast models show the hurricane curving northward into the open ocean. This trajectory is expected to keep it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast, though meteorologists continue to monitor its progress closely.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited Stewartson's public accusations that Patel was a "Kremlin asset" and involved in planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own case, calling the legal action an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones and a wider range of price points compared to the iPhone. Analysts note that while Apple still leads, its static design has created an opening for Samsung's new form factors. In response, Apple is expected to launch a slimmer iPhone and is rumored to be developing its own foldable device for release in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

The statement emphasizes that there can be no limitations on Ukraine's military as part of any peace deal and vows to maintain economic pressure on Russia as long as the conflict continues. This unified European stance aims to manage the diplomatic fallout from the bilateral U.S.-Russia talks, to which they were not invited.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, a student from Florida studying at Newcastle University in the U.K., discovered a rare 9th-century gold artifact during her very first archaeological excavation. The object, a decorative gold piece about 1.5 inches long, was found buried near the route of a major Roman road in Northumberland. This find is particularly significant as it was near the location where a similar object was discovered in 2021, leading experts to believe the pair may have been deliberately buried for a religious or ceremonial purpose. The artifact offers new insight into the activities of high-status individuals in the region after the fall of the Roman Empire.</p>

The company, Fold, is aiming to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase from current models, to adapt to a changing battlefield where high-value targets are now farther from the front lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, such as added weight and potential snags, the ability to conduct unjammable precision strikes at such distances could provide a major tactical advantage for Ukrainian forces.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with homicides on pace to reach levels not seen since the 1970s. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on a small number of individuals most at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence. Instead of zero-tolerance policing, the city uses a "carrot and stick" approach, offering targeted social services, job training, and housing, while also ensuring stricter prosecution for those who continue violent activity. The program, funded in part by federal grants, represents a major shift from past policies and has achieved impressive results in reducing recidivism.</p>

          <p>According to a recent survey, Americans believe the ideal age to begin saving for retirement is 27, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners strongly recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While a three-decade saving period is viable, an earlier start in one's early 20s can result in a significantly larger nest egg with smaller monthly contributions. The article notes that many people regret not starting to save sooner, as a late start often requires more aggressive and challenging savings strategies to catch up. (not investment advice)</p>

This "national scandal" is driven by rising housing costs and economic instability, forcing healthcare providers to partner with developers or purchase their own properties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda suggests that young chimps acquire their patterns of combining vocal sounds and physical gestures from their mothers, not their fathers. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line exhibited similar communication styles, a pattern not seen among paternally related chimps. Because young chimpanzees spend their formative years almost exclusively with their mothers, this indicates the behavior is learned rather than purely genetic. This finding suggests that the capacity for socially learned communication may be an ancient trait dating back at least six million years to the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.</p>

This marks the first known black bear family to reside in the area in years, raising questions among local residents about coexisting with the new ursine neighbors. The bear, tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, crossed multiple major highways and navigated urban areas during her remarkable trek. Her decision to den and raise cubs in the area suggests she may be ending her nomadic phase, establishing a new permanent presence for the species in the region.</p>

The plan identifies resilient habitats, aims to mitigate wildfire risk, and introduces genetic diversity to help the trees adapt to warmer temperatures. However, the plan is controversial among some high desert communities, who argue that new permitting requirements and fees for removing trees will stifle development and increase living costs. The effort is considered groundbreaking for its proactive approach to conserving a species based on future climate projections.</p>
