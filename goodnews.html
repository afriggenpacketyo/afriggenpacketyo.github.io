          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover "null and void". The USIP leaders were forcibly removed from their positions in March by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. The judge ruled that the takeover was unlawful, leading to the reinstatement of USIP's original leadership. USIP, established 41 years ago, aims to provide analysis and resources for global peace efforts and conflict resolution.</p>

          <p>Tech and music industry leaders testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, advocating for the passage of the bipartisan No Fakes Act to protect individuals from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes.

Supporters argue that the No Fakes Act is a crucial step in addressing the misuse of AI technology while allowing for its responsible use.

          <p>Researchers are calling for the NHS to offer additional scans to women with dense breasts as part of the breast screening programme to detect more cancers and save lives. A Cambridge University-led study found that using different scans from traditional mammograms could treble the number of cancers detected in this group. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but cancers are harder to spot because they look whiter on the x-rays, the same colour as early-stage cancers. The study suggests that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly improve cancer detection rates.</p>
