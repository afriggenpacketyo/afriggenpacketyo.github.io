          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular, experts are cautioning women about relying solely on this procedure. Egg freezing is expensive, costing upwards of $12,000 per cycle, with additional storage and fertilization fees. There are no guarantees of success, as eggs may not survive the thawing process or develop into viable embryos. Critics also argue that the emphasis on profits in the fertility industry could lead to warped incentives, potentially pressuring doctors to encourage more cycles. The article also mentions that society's pressure on women to delay motherhood for career advancement should be addressed with better workplace policies.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is on the rise as more women seek to preserve their fertility and expand their reproductive options. The number of egg freezing procedures has increased significantly in recent years, with women freezing their eggs to increase their chances of having a baby later in life. Many women view egg freezing as a way to delay finding a partner or starting a family, while still preserving their fertility. However, experts caution that egg freezing is not a guarantee of future pregnancy and that success rates decrease with age and the number of eggs frozen.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures increasing significantly in recent years.

However, egg freezing is expensive, costing between $12,000 and $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees, and thawing and fertilization costs an additional $10,000. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket, viewing it as a way to preserve their options and avoid compromising on finding the right partner.</p>
