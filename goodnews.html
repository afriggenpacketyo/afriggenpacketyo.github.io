          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep serves as the brain's nightly clean-up crew, flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
