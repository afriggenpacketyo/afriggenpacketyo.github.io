          <p>Tom Kopke, a Munich resident, secured his second consecutive win at the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake in Gloucestershire, England, a tradition where participants chase a speeding wheel of cheese down a steep hill. Despite dry weather making the incline more dangerous than usual, Kopke emerged as the victor, claiming the coveted 3.6-kilogram Double Gloucester cheese as his prize. He expressed his determination to retain his title, stating that he risked his life for the win, while the women's race was won by Ava Sender Logan, who ran in support of the Refugee Community Kitchen. The annual event, dating back centuries, attracts thousands of spectators and competitors, though it was officially scrapped in 2010 due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from New York City and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94, according to a statement from his family.

Throughout his career, Rangel fought for affordable housing, urban revitalization, fair tax policies, and equal opportunities, and he was the first Black chair of the House's Ways and Means Committee. He faced ethics violations in 2008, leading to a censure in 2010, but remained a respected figure in Harlem.</p>

          <p>Democrats are reportedly shifting away from using jargon favored by activists in an effort to win back voters who supported Donald Trump. Party figures have expressed concern that phrases like "Latinx" and an emphasis on issues such as pronouns have alienated ordinary voters. Some Democrats believe that using simpler language can help them connect with a broader range of people, as not everyone is familiar with the latest terminology. The shift comes after criticisms of figures like Kamala Harris for using "word salad" responses during interviews and a perception that Democrats are out of touch with regular people.</p>
