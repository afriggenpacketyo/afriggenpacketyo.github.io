          <p>The White House announced that a trade deal has been reached with China, though details remain scarce and China refers to the agreement as a 'consensus.' U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the deal would help resolve the 'national emergency' caused by trade imbalances. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that 'substantial progress' had been made, but stopped short of touting a full deal. The announcement comes after President Trump expressed willingness to ease tariffs on China.</p>

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a bike accident, has regained the ability to walk short distances through a clinical trial using a "digital bridge" technology. The technology wirelessly connects an implant on top of her brain to a spinal cord stimulator, enabling her to move her legs with her thoughts. This innovative approach, developed by Swiss neuroscientists, bypasses the spinal cord injury and allows for direct communication between the brain and the muscles controlling leg movement. Carsteanu-Dombi describes this achievement as gaining a superpower.</p>

          <p>After a record-breaking heat wave over the weekend, Southern California is expected to experience a significant drop in temperatures, with the return of a heavy marine layer. Temperatures are forecast to decrease by more than 20 degrees by Monday, bringing highs in the mid-60s along the beaches and around 70 degrees in the valleys. The marine layer will deepen, bringing low clouds and drizzle, especially by Tuesday, signaling the arrival of 'May gray' conditions.
