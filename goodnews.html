          <p>The phone call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has provided a temporary respite for Asian countries caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade rivalry. The conversation, described as "very positive" by Trump, signals a potential easing of tensions after weeks of escalating hostility. For many of China's neighbors that rely on trade with both powers, this detente offers a chance to avoid choosing between prioritizing trade with China and navigating aggressive U.S. policies. However, analysts caution that the relationship between the two superpowers remains fragile and could still present challenges for the region.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong continues to be China's leading hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai due to its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. Despite the presence of mainland exchanges, companies are increasingly choosing Hong Kong for capital infusions, driven by its established financial infrastructure and global reach. Recent geopolitical tensions have further solidified Hong Kong's position, as companies seek a stable and internationally-recognized platform for their financial activities.

          <p>Japan and the United States are working towards a trade agreement by mid-June, despite unresolved issues regarding tariffs. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed that further progress was made during talks with U.S. officials. However, Japan insists on the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently includes a 24% rate on Japanese goods. Japan has proposed joint efforts in strengthening supply chains, cooperation in shipbuilding, and expanding imports of U.S. farm products.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy in response to escalating public concerns over rising rice prices ahead of a crucial national election. Ishiba plans to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system to counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. The reform aims to boost rice production, but challenges remain, including the risk of oversupply and price plunges. Ishiba's consumer-focused approach involves releasing reserve rice to lower prices, while critics caution against using rice policy as a political tool.
