          <p>Former President Joe Biden has started the process of building his presidential library in his home state of Delaware, assembling a board of former aides and allies to lead the fundraising efforts. The project aims to create a museum and archive detailing his four years in office, alongside a center for civic engagement. The fundraising team faces challenges in a divided political climate and with the rising costs of such legacy projects, which have soared into the hundreds of millions for recent presidents. The library will be located in Delaware, the state that launched his extensive political career.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones on Sunday, September 7th, around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. The upcoming test aims to address technical issues from the first trial in April 2023, where some users received multiple alerts or none at all. The alert will cause compatible phones to vibrate and emit a siren sound, and while opting out is possible, the government advises against it for safety reasons.</p>

          <p>Actor Steve Buscemi has revealed that most people, including himself for a long time, have been mispronouncing his last name. During an interview, he explained that while the traditional Italian way is "Boo-shemi," his family pronounced it "Bue-semi" growing up, and he now uses a hybrid "Boo-Semi." The topic arose from a running joke in his cameo on the series "The Studio," highlighting the common confusion. This follows a similar revelation from actor Denzel Washington, who also recently shared that his name has been pronounced incorrectly throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a live-streamed dive to the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States, offering a rare look at its underwater environment. The expedition, conducted by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named "Emmy," explored the lakebed over 1,500 feet below the surface. Experts provided commentary on the lake's ancient geological history and unique ecosystems, while also addressing and debunking popular myths about mob bodies. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about conservation efforts needed to protect the lake's famous clarity.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has presented a detailed plan to the company's board aimed at improving performance and growth. The proposal criticizes past strategic missteps, such as retaining a costly bottling network and failing to reinvest in core soda brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott recommends refranchising the bottling business, divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and refocusing investment on its dominant Frito-Lay North America and core beverage products. The firm believes these changes could unlock significant shareholder value, potentially increasing it by at least 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bernadette Joy, a self-made millionaire and financial coach, advocates for renting over homeownership, a choice she made after owning four properties. She argues that renting has made her wealthier by allowing her to invest the proceeds from her home sales and focus on her business without the stress and hidden costs of property management. Joy points to underestimated expenses like renovations, repairs, property taxes, and the emotional labor of being a landlord as significant drawbacks to owning. For her, the flexibility and reduced mental load of renting currently outweigh the traditional benefits of building equity through homeownership.</p>

          <p>A Harvard-trained expert outlines seven characteristics that contribute to the success of high achievers like Taylor Swift, including imagination, synthesis, and intense focus. The article notes Swift's ability to build entire worlds from small details and her commitment to songwriting and performing without diversifying into unrelated ventures. Other crucial traits highlighted are doggedness in the face of difficulty, sustained passion for her work, reverence for her craft, and a deep commitment that requires sacrificing other options. These qualities, the author argues, are essential for achieving exceptional levels of success in any field.</p>

          <p>A growing cultural trend, exemplified by the viral "We Do Not Care Club," sees women finding freedom by rejecting societal pressures, particularly those related to appearance and pleasing men. This movement reflects a broader desire to let go of the anxiety of being judged, which is a natural human instinct but often overblown. The article suggests that not caring is not about apathy, but about consciously deciding whose opinions matter and whose do not. This selective indifference can be a quiet act of defiance, reshaping personal choices about life, relationships, and self-worth in a world full of external pressures.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals a largely unseen collection of photographs by Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré photographer who documented the American jazz scene in the early 1950s. While known for her street photography, Model embarked on a project to capture jazz musicians and their audiences, but it was halted due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. Her images captured not just the joy of the music but also the wariness and pain of its Black performers, who faced racism and violence despite their fame. The collection includes poignant postmortem photos of Billie Holiday, after which Model reportedly never photographed jazz again.</p>

It will involve two spacecraft: an impactor designed to collide with the asteroid and an observer to measure the resulting orbital change, which is expected to be between 3 to 5 centimeters. If successful, China would become the second nation, after the United States, to demonstrate this crucial planetary defense capability.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have reached new record highs, gaining about 35% this year to trade near $3,600 an ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset during periods of political and financial instability. For those looking to gain exposure, most financial experts recommend using gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than buying physical bullion, as ETFs are more liquid, cost-effective, and tax-efficient. Despite the rally, advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

Initially hailed as a progressive, Obama-era phenomenon that celebrated an immigrant's story, the show's optimistic tone now feels different in the current political climate. Academic Daniel Pollack-Pelzner notes that while the show's first act reflected a hopeful vision of America, the nation now seems to be living in its more polarized and tragic second act. The musical's legacy is now viewed through the lens of subsequent political divisions and a more critical perspective on the founding fathers.</p>
