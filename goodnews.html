          <p>Scientists have identified a new skyscraper-sized asteroid, named 2025 SC79, which is the second-fastest known asteroid, orbiting the sun every 128 days. The discovery was made by Carnegie Science astronomer Scott S. Sheppard as part of a NASA-funded project to find "twilight" asteroids that could pose a potential threat to Earth. This celestial body is also only the second known object with an orbit entirely inside that of Venus, crossing Mercury's path during its journey. The research helps in understanding solar system history and enhancing planetary defense.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock experienced a nearly 8% increase after a report revealed that IBM can use its chips for a quantum computing error correction algorithm. An IBM spokesperson confirmed the development, which is part of a collaboration aimed at building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. This milestone is seen as a significant step in scaling quantum technology without relying on expensive GPU clusters. The news also positively impacted other quantum-related stocks, highlighting growing investor interest in the advanced computing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United States is advocating for the swift creation and deployment of an international peacekeeping force in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that several nations, including Indonesia and the UAE, have offered to contribute troops, but Israel will have final approval over the force's composition. A key point of contention is the potential involvement of Turkish troops, which Israel has reportedly rejected. The force is a critical component of the U.S.-brokered peace plan aimed at stabilizing the region after two years of devastating conflict.</p>

Leclerc finished just ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, with championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren securing the fourth-fastest time. Piastri's main title rivals, Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, did not participate in the session, allowing their teams to fulfill mandatory rookie driving requirements. The session saw minor incidents, including spins from junior drivers Arvid Lindblad and Isack Hadjar, on the notoriously dusty track.</p>

          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis with a brain aneurysm, seemingly linking it to stress, medical experts have weighed in on the connection. Doctors clarified that while chronic stress can elevate blood pressure, a risk factor for aneurysm growth, it is not a direct cause. The primary culprits are typically genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. Most aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but the news has raised public awareness about the condition, which is more prevalent in women.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and an alleged major fentanyl trafficker, has been extradited from Cuba to the U.S. with assistance from Mexico. Zhang is accused of running a large-scale drug trafficking and money laundering operation, coordinating the importation of fentanyl and cocaine into the U.S. for distribution across multiple states. He allegedly worked closely with Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels. His transfer to U.S. custody marks a significant development in the international effort to combat the flow of synthetic opioids.</p>

          <p>In a significant show of Democratic party unity, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. The endorsement comes just before the start of early voting and provides a major boost to Mamdani, a progressive assemblyman from Queens. Jeffries stated he respects the will of primary voters and Mamdani's commitment to addressing the city's affordability crisis. The endorsement contrasts with that of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who recently backed Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% that economists had anticipated. The report, released by the Department of Labor despite the ongoing government shutdown, is crucial for determining the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security. While tariffs have contributed to upward price pressure, the impact on consumers has been partly muted as businesses absorb some costs. This inflation data is expected to support another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers are preparing for a holiday season marked by more cautious and price-sensitive consumers.

Executives note that consumers are increasingly savvy, aggregating their purchases around major discount events like Black Friday. Retailers are also emphasizing their lower-priced private brands to appeal to budget-conscious customers, while remaining "cautiously optimistic" about the overall season. (not investment advice)</p>
