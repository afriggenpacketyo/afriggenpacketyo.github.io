        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International researchers claim to have found a candidate for a ninth planet in our solar system using data from infrared space telescopes. The potential planet's long orbit would enable them to see it move across the sky, and they found 13 pairs of dots that could be explained by a moving planet resembling Planet Nine. However, astronomer Mike Brown, who was part of the original hypothesis team, remains skeptical, stating that the potential planet's orbit would be on a much greater tilt than the solar system's plane. Astronomers will have a closer look using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory on Chile‚Äôs Cerro Pach√≥n mountain.</p>

          <p>China's private firms are set to gain enhanced legal recourse with a new law designed to bolster the private economy, scheduled to take effect on May 20. The Private Economy Promotion Law is being closely watched by observers and entrepreneurs to assess its effectiveness, particularly regarding the ability of firms to sue local governments and protection from arbitrary fines. Rui Meng, an economics professor, notes the law's clear provisions on curbing administrative powers, which could empower entrepreneurs in litigation against local governments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell framed the targeting of Perkins as an assault on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The ruling permanently blocks the order, which had imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients and causes that Trump disliked. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <h2>Is There a Rise in Autism Diagnoses?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:19:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC article explores the increasing number of autism diagnoses and the reasons behind the trend. The article references a study that found an eightfold increase in new autism diagnoses in the UK between 1998 and 2018. Experts suggest that the rise in diagnoses is not necessarily due to an increase in the number of autistic people, but rather changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, particularly among women and adults. The article also highlights the debate surrounding the definition of autism and the diversity of experiences within the autistic community.</p>
