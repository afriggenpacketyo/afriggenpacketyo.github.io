This agreement, valued at over $32 billion, is seen as a move to modernize Korean Air's fleet and maintain competitiveness amidst its merger with Asiana Airlines. The deal also aligns with Trump's push for trading partners to increase business with American firms, supporting an estimated 135,000 jobs across the U.S. This marks a significant boost for Boeing, which has faced recent crises and production challenges.

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This follows a previous scrub on Sunday caused by an oxygen leak in a ground system. The milestone mission aims to test fixes and upgrades after three prior catastrophic failures, with a successful launch crucial for a faster cadence towards autonomous propellant transfers for NASA's moon landing and future Mars flights. While challenges remain, SpaceX's history of rapid innovation offers hope for overcoming these engineering hurdles.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Agrees to Restore $6.8 Billion in Education Funds Following Multi-State Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 20:52:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding, including for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-learners, following a multi-state lawsuit. The funds were initially withheld without clear explanation, though a White House spokesperson cited concerns about "misused" money for a "radical left-wing agenda." California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the agreement, emphasizing that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 prohibits the president from unilaterally withholding congressionally allocated funds. The restoration provides relief to programs affecting 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families.</p>

          <h2>Brazilian Judge Blocks Suspension of Amazon Soy Moratorium, Upholding Environmental Pact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 20:45:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Brazilian federal judge has issued an injunction, temporarily suspending an antitrust watchdog's order to halt the "soy moratorium" program. This two-decade-old private pact prevents soybean traders from purchasing from farmers who cleared Amazon rainforest land after July 2008, aiming to protect the environment. The antitrust watchdog, CADE, had previously ordered the suspension due to concerns about companies sharing commercially sensitive information, prompting criticism from environmental groups and the Environmental Ministry. The judge's decision sides with oilseed crushers' lobby Abiove, maintaining the moratorium until a full CADE panel makes a final ruling on the appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are advocating for a $1 billion annual investment from cap-and-trade revenue to sustain the state's high-speed rail project, whose federal funds remain suspended. The project, billions over budget and decades behind schedule, has created nearly 15,000 jobs and generated significant economic growth, with projections for over a million jobs upon completion. Challenges include permitting delays and the Trump administration's withdrawal of $4 billion in funding. While leaders emphasize the need for long-term financial commitments, the project faces considerable hurdles without secure funding sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Traditional advice on rigid "sitting up straight" for good posture is outdated, according to Dr. Xand van Tulleken, who suggests a dynamic approach to back health. His three rules emphasize continuous movement, building strength without stiffness, and adopting a positive mindset. Staying in one position for too long, even in an ergonomic chair, can be detrimental; regular breaks and simple exercises are crucial. Furthermore, the article highlights that back pain is often linked to emotional and psychological stress, suggesting that addressing lifestyle factors is as important as physical adjustments.</p>

This initiative, described as "complex and challenging," would mark the first time Gazan students have left to study in the UK since the Hamas-Israel war began in 2023. Students will undergo visa biometric checks in a third country before arriving, though Israel's approval for each student's departure is still required. This decision follows months of campaigning and coincides with UK plans to evacuate critically ill Gazan children for medical treatment.</p>
