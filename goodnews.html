          <p>The appearance of a senior Taiwanese officer at a military exercise in Alaska has garnered significant attention, suggesting closer defense cooperation with the United States in the future.

Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force‚Äôs flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, one of the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs largest annual air combat drills. The exercise involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the US, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and other countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued threatened critical work in various technology fields. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. This decision follows similar rulings blocking caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
