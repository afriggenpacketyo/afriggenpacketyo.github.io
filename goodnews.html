          <h2>Experts Weigh in on Mortgage Rate Outlook Following Fed's June Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 09:37:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that significant mortgage rate relief is unlikely immediately after the Federal Reserve's June meeting, as mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than to Fed policy changes. While inflation is declining, it remains above the Fed's 2% target, and the job market remains strong, reducing the urgency for rate cuts. Some experts predict potential rate cuts later in the year, possibly leading to a slight decrease in mortgage rates. Despite elevated rates, professionals advise that those financially ready should consider buying now due to less competition and the potential for rising home prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The book highlights the historical context of housing policies, including discriminatory practices and funding cuts, and advocates for the "Housing First" model.
