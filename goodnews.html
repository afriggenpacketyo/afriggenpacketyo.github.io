          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that consumer inflation expectations have decreased, returning to levels seen before the implementation of recent trade tariffs. In June, respondents anticipated a 3% inflation rate over the next year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college tuition, and rent. The survey also noted improved employment metrics, with fewer people expecting job losses or a rise in unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has introduced a new National Farm Security Action Plan aimed at preventing foreign adversaries, particularly China, from acquiring American farmland. The plan proposes legislative and executive actions to ban Chinese nationals from buying agricultural land and to assess foreign land holdings near military bases. Administration officials, including the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, framed the issue as a matter of national security, citing concerns about agroterrorism and the potential for agricultural resources to be "weaponized." The move reflects a broader effort to secure the nation's food supply from foreign influence.</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, is now allowing teenagers aged 14 to 17 to use its driverless ride-hailing service, starting in the Phoenix area. Parents can invite their teens to the program through their own Waymo accounts, enabling the teens to hail fully autonomous rides independently. The service includes safety features such as specially-trained support agents and the ability for parents to track trips in real-time. This expansion aims to increase ridership as Waymo continues to grow its operations across major U.S. cities, with future launches planned in Miami and Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A 48-year-old man has been identified as the 140th "stolen grandchild" traced by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group in Argentina. The man was born in a clandestine detention center in 1977 to parents who were left-wing activists "disappeared" by the military dictatorship. DNA tests confirmed his identity, reuniting him with his older sister, who has been searching for him for decades. The Grandmothers group continues to search for an estimated 300 more children who were taken from their imprisoned mothers and often given to families aligned with the regime.</p>

          <h2>Economic Anxiety Fuels 'Revenge Saving' Trend Among Americans, Survey Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 12:38:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey indicates that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their financial habits based on feelings about the economy. This anxiety has led to a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," as consumers look to build emergency funds amid uncertainty. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions, instead recommending intentional strategies. They suggest assessing spending habits, using "reverse budgeting" to prioritize savings, and automating contributions to appropriate accounts to build wealth consistently over time.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that GE Vernova's stock, despite its significant recent rally, has more room to grow. He highlighted a positive analyst note from BMO Capital, which pointed to nearly $80 billion in future service-related revenue that is insulated from fluctuations in equipment demand. Cramer suggests that investors who feel they've "missed the move" are overlooking this key aspect of the company's value. He also noted that potential new overseas orders and favorable accounting changes from recent legislation could further boost the company's prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sweeping new budget bill includes a provision for creating government-seeded investment accounts, nicknamed "Trump accounts," for children. Under the new law, U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028 will receive an initial $1,000 contribution from the government into an account that parents can open on their behalf. Parents and employers can contribute additional post-tax funds, which grow tax-deferred until the child turns 18, after which withdrawals are taxed as income. While financial experts note the "free money" is a benefit, they suggest other vehicles like 529 plans may offer better tax advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, has downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant price increases, comparing the odds to rare events like a meteor strike. Speaking on CNBC, Miran acknowledged that while such events can happen, there is currently no evidence of widespread tariff-driven inflation. He promoted a new White House report showing a fall in imported goods prices between December and May. Economists, however, argue that price hikes are still expected, citing delays in tariff implementation and the time it takes for costs to filter to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
