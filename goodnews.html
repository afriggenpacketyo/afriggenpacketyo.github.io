          <p>Payments from Facebook's $725 million privacy settlement are being distributed to eligible users who filed a claim. The settlement resolves lawsuits alleging the company improperly shared user data with third parties, a controversy highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. While parent company Meta denies wrongdoing, approved claimants will receive an email notification and can expect an average payment of around $29, with amounts varying based on the duration of their Facebook usage between 2007 and 2022. The distribution process is expected to continue over several weeks.</p>

          <p>Detroit City FC is requesting approximately $88 million in development incentives from the city of Detroit to support its proposed new soccer stadium and mixed-use development in the Corktown neighborhood. The request includes a $74 million Brownfield tax capture and nearly $14 million in commercial tax abatements. Proponents project the development will create over 1,000 construction jobs and generate significant economic impact for local businesses, with a positive net fiscal benefit to the city despite the tax breaks. The plan also includes 68 affordable housing units. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California State Assembly is considering SB 53, a bill that would require developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to report on how they mitigate potential catastrophic risks. The legislation targets major AI systems like ChatGPT and defines catastrophic risk as an event causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages. If passed, companies would need to publish safety frameworks and report critical incidents, with whistleblower protections for employees. The bill represents a significant state-level effort to regulate fast-moving AI technology, focusing on preventing large-scale disasters such as AI-enabled bioweapons or critical infrastructure cyberattacks.</p>

          <p>The novel "Muscle Man" by Jordan Castro provides a satirical yet empathetic portrait of a modern contrarian, an English professor named Harold. Feeling alienated by the liberal-arts college environment, Harold turns to weightlifting and develops a reactionary worldview, fueled by paranoia and grievances about modern society. The novel meticulously chronicles his internal monologue, showing how personal anxieties and minor workplace conflicts can be projected into broad, politically charged ideologies. It captures a contemporary phenomenon of individuals who, feeling adrift, latch onto fringe ideas to find a sense of meaning and connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs is causing a noticeable shift in the apparel industry, particularly in the clothing resale market. Resellers report a significant increase in the availability of larger-sized clothing, while demand for smaller sizes is growing. This "Ozempic effect" is leading some retailers to adjust their in-store inventory, stocking fewer extended sizes and moving them to online-only offerings. While the plus-size market remains substantial and underserved, the trend indicates a change in consumer body sizes that could have long-term implications for clothing manufacturers and retailers.</p>
