          <p>A dive team has located the wreck of the ST Seiner, a World War I-era fishing vessel that sank off the coast of Nantucket nearly a century ago. The ship, which went down in a storm in January 1929 with 21 men aboard, was discovered 200 feet underwater. Using sonar scans and identifying distinctive features like its steam engine and trawl winch, the Atlantic Wreck Salvage team confirmed the vessel's identity. The company hopes the discovery provides a measure of closure for the descendants of the crew who were lost at sea.</p>

          <p>With national credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion, many Americans are facing significant financial stress. This article outlines several clever strategies for tackling debt, moving beyond simple minimum payments. Methods discussed include the psychological 'snowball' approach, which targets small debts first, and the mathematical 'avalanche' method, focusing on high-interest debts. Other effective tactics involve utilizing 0% balance transfer offers, negotiating directly with creditors for lower rates, and seeking guidance from professional credit counselors or debt settlement programs to create a structured and manageable repayment plan.

          <p>The state visit of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to the UK has been marked by carefully chosen attire, functioning as a form of fashion diplomacy. Melania Trump's wide-brimmed purple hat and Dior suit were seen as a nod to her husband's agenda, while her later choice of a British Burberry trench coat was interpreted as a diplomatic gesture. Similarly, the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla wore outfits by British designers, with color choices that appeared coordinated to reflect the US flag. These sartorial decisions are analyzed as powerful, non-verbal messages of support, strategy, and national identity during high-stakes international events.</p>

          <p>A press conference for the upcoming boxing rematch between Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn became a heated affair, dominated by arguments between Eubank and promoter Eddie Hearn. Eubank accused Team Benn and Hearn of attempting to 'sabotage' him before their first fight, alleging contract breaches and interference with his weight cut. Hearn dismissed the claims as 'waffle' and accused Eubank of playing the victim. The tense media event underscores the lingering bad blood between the two camps as they prepare for their second bout in November, following Eubank's points victory in their first encounter.</p>

          <p>The state banquet at Windsor Castle for President Trump featured a guest list heavy on political figures and technology executives rather than celebrities. Notable attendees included Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who was seated near a key advisor to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales. The elaborate event, a key element of diplomatic hospitality, also included a musical selection reportedly reflecting some of the president's favorite songs, such as 'You Can't Always Get What You Want.'</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill aimed at preventing financial abuse against the elderly and other vulnerable adults is gaining momentum in Congress. The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, which was unanimously approved by the House Financial Services Committee, would empower financial institutions like mutual funds to delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme. This legislative effort addresses a growing problem, as a recent AARP report estimated that adults over 60 lose over $28 billion annually to financial theft. The bill would also require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report to Congress on further ways to strengthen protections for vulnerable investors.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to a potential safety hazard. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors may not be properly secured and could detach while the vehicle is in motion. These detached parts could create a road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. The issue is related to vehicle assembly rather than a parts defect, and Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any related accidents or injuries. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim free of charge.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino stated that despite rising prices, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the immense demand for live events in a post-pandemic world, noting that touring has become the primary revenue source for artists. He argued that while a courtside seat at a basketball game can cost tens of thousands, the average concert ticket is only $72. The live music industry is projected to grow significantly through 2030, fueled by younger generations who prioritize shared experiences, reinforcing the cultural and commercial power of live entertainment.</p>

          <p>The Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has offered an optimistic perspective on the trade disruptions caused by President Trump's unilateral tariffs. She characterized the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new wave of 'reglobalisation.' Speaking at a WTO forum, she pushed back against claims that the organization has become irrelevant, stating that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. She argued that the current turbulence is a chance for the global trading system to evolve and adapt rather than a sign of its demise.</p>

          <p>As Bitcoin's value has nearly doubled over the past year, more Americans are considering adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts. Financial experts remain divided on the wisdom of this strategy, emphasizing the asset class's inherent volatility and risk. Proponents argue that for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon, a small allocation to crypto could offer significant rewards. However, critics caution that retirement accounts are primarily for safe, secure growth, and the unpredictable nature of digital assets makes them a dangerous choice for many savers. All agree that thorough research and strict allocation limits are essential for anyone considering the move. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasized Frontier's lower operating costs and its role in serving budget-conscious travelers who might otherwise not fly.

          <p>Average interest rates for 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen to 6.13%, their lowest level in three years, providing potential relief for homebuyers and existing homeowners. This sharp decline is largely driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, a move that was anticipated by bond markets. The lower rates have already sparked a surge in both new mortgage and refinancing applications. Experts advise prospective borrowers to act by comparing lenders to lock in the best deal, checking their credit scores, and getting preapproved to gain an edge in a potentially more competitive housing market.
