          <p>Rangers will face Panathinaikos in Russell Martin's first competitive game as head coach, marking a tough draw for the Ibrox side despite being seeded. Panathinaikos, managed by former Egypt coach Rui Vitoria, finished 16 points behind Olympiakos in the Greek Super League last season and have a strong historical record against Scottish teams. Rangers progressed the last time they met, but Panathinaikos have never lost to Scottish opponents over 90 minutes in seven meetings. The upcoming match is a Champions League qualifier with significant implications for Rangers' European campaign, and Panathinaikos have not reached the Champions League proper since 2010-11.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket as part of its expansion into the space sector, aiming for a suborbital launch by 2029. The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, saw the prototype rocket reach an altitude of nearly 300 meters before landing just 37 centimeters from its designated spot. Honda plans to utilize its existing technologies from various products and automated driving systems to develop reusable rockets. The company envisions these rockets being used for satellite-based communication tools and environmental monitoring, as demand for satellite launch rockets increases with the growth of data systems in outer space.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 07:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing 'tariff engineering' to lower import duties by strategically altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into more favorable 'harmonized system codes.' This practice, which predates Trump, involves redesigning products to qualify for exemptions or lower tariff rates. For example, some manufacturers bundled steel and aluminum elements into products to qualify for lower duties, while others are now removing those elements as tariffs change. Companies must carefully navigate redesigning products without fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case of misclassifying Transit Connect vans to circumvent tariffs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's policies are benefiting fossil fuel donors like Kelcy Warren, who contributed significantly to Trump's 2024 campaign. Energy Transfer Partners, co-founded by Warren, has seen increased profits and benefits from Trump's actions, including ending the pause on liquefied natural gas exports and securing a three-year extension for an LNG project. These moves have increased Warren's wealth and boosted demand for pipelines, also benefiting from projected datacenter growth. The appointment of fossil fuel-friendly officials to key positions further supports companies like Energy Transfer Partners, creating a favorable environment for oil and gas.

          <p>Despite mortgage rates falling to their lowest since April, mortgage demand has decreased, indicating weak consumer sentiment weighing on the housing market. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 3% last week, even as the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.84%. Economic uncertainty is cited as a key factor influencing potential homebuyers' decisions, with refinance applications also falling despite the rate drop.

          <p>Germany's 50+1 rule, in place since 1999, ensures that club members retain control over professional football clubs, preventing external investors from taking complete control.

Exceptions exist for clubs like Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg due to long-term investment, while RB Leipzig is criticized for circumventing the rule.

Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices in May, and the Bank of England is not expected to cut interest rates.

          <p>Metro faces challenges in securing $2 billion in funding from the Trump administration to lease 2,700 buses for the 2028 Olympics, which are crucial for transporting attendees between venues. The plan relies on a robust bus fleet traveling on designated lanes to prevent traffic congestion, but the federal government has not yet responded to the funding request. Metro's commitment to clean energy buses also poses supply and infrastructure challenges, with limited time to train operators and provide housing. Despite the challenges, city leaders remain optimistic that the Olympics will promote public transit use among Angelenos.</p>

          <p>President Trump's claims that undocumented immigrants are a key voting bloc in Democratic cities, used to expand their voter base and cheat in elections, are false, according to Los Angeles County election officials. The county has safeguards in place to ensure only eligible voters cast ballots and that all votes are accurately counted. Researchers have found that fraud conducted by voters at the polls is virtually nonexistent. The claim that immigrants lacking documentation vote in large numbers has been repeated for years, fueled by the racist conspiracy theory of the 'great replacement.'</p>

          <p>The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles features an 11-acre landscape designed by Mia Lehrer and Studio-MLA, crafted to complement the museum's visual storytelling theme. The landscape, inspired by myths, movies, and the diverse terrain of California, unfolds in distinct vignettes with varied textures and framed views. The design incorporates a green roof, drought-tolerant plants, and a rain-harvesting system, creating a porous public space that connects Expo Park to the surrounding neighborhood. The project represents a convergence of design, ecology, storytelling, infrastructure, and community, reflecting Lehrer's career-long commitment to creating meaningful public spaces.</p>
