          <p>The author reflects on lessons learned from studying resistance to Nazism and applies them to the current political climate in the United States.

It emphasizes the importance of self-scrutiny and empathy, urging the left to avoid judgmental streaks and embrace those who may have been misled. The author concludes by highlighting the role of the arts and community engagement in fostering resistance and creating a better future for everyone. </p>
