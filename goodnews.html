          <h2>Federal Judge Dismisses Trump DOJ Lawsuit Targeting Chicago's Sanctuary Policies</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice against the city's sanctuary policies. Judge Lindsay Jenkins, a Biden appointee, ruled that Chicago's ordinances, which limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities, are lawful and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The DOJ had argued that these local laws unlawfully interfere with federal immigration enforcement, but the court found they fall within the state's rights under the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling as an affirmation of the city's welcoming policies and a rejection of what he termed a reckless immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Tennis champion Venus Williams brought attention to the complexities of the U.S. health insurance system when she quipped she returned to competition to regain her benefits. The article uses her situation to explain common challenges, such as losing employer-sponsored insurance after a work break and the high cost of continuing coverage through COBRA. It notes that despite her wealth, Williams' needs as an elite athlete with pre-existing health conditions make finding suitable insurance difficult. The piece also highlights improvements since the Affordable Care Act, which eliminated denials for pre-existing conditions and ended the practice of deeming certain professions, like athletes, as uninsurable.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 08:13:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a dramatic 29-26 victory over Australia to win their series, thanks to a last-minute try by Hugo Keenan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The Lions overcame a significant 23-5 deficit after a powerful first-half performance from the Wallabies, who scored three tries to stun the tourists. However, the Lions mounted a remarkable comeback with tries from Tom Curry and Huw Jones before halftime, narrowing the gap. The match remained intensely close until Keenan's final play, which was confirmed after a tense review, sealing the Lions' first series win with two initial test victories since 1997.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where the KMT and its allies hold a majority. Supporters of the recall were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation and passing of controversial reforms seen as favoring China. The failure of the recall signals that President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance ahead of next year's local elections.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old man diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, has made a remarkable recovery following a double-lung transplant. Initially given less than a year to live after medications failed to halt the progressive scarring of his lungs, Kennedy was approved for the complex surgery despite his age. After a month-long hospital wait and several setbacks, including a post-surgery stroke, his lung capacity is now at 98%. Kennedy is back to an active life, training his new puppy to be a hospital therapy dog, a pursuit that has gained deeper meaning after his own life-changing medical journey.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, veteran closer Kenley Jansen, currently with the Anaheim Angels, could potentially be traded, with his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, seen as a possible destination. Jansen, who is having one of his best seasons since he last played for the Dodgers in 2021, expressed that he had once hoped to spend his entire career with the team. With the Dodgers in need of right-handed relievers and the Angels unlikely to make the playoffs, a trade could be mutually beneficial. Jansen has indicated he would be open to a non-closer role on a contending team to pursue another World Series title.</p>

          <p>As wedding costs rise, many couples are turning to credit cards to finance their big day, a move that experts say can be beneficial if managed strategically. Using a credit card can help couples earn significant rewards points or miles, especially through sign-up bonuses, which can be used for honeymoons or other expenses. However, the key is to have the savings available to pay off the balance immediately to avoid high-interest debt. With average wedding costs expected to reach $36,000 in 2025, financial planners warn against sacrificing long-term financial well-being for a short-term event by accumulating debt.</p>
