          <p>The price of gold has seen a remarkable surge, consistently remaining in the $3,300 range after starting January 2024 at around $2,000 per ounce. Investors should monitor upcoming economic reports in June that could influence gold prices, specifically the unemployment report on June 6, the inflation report on June 11, and the Federal Reserve meeting on June 18. Declining unemployment or inflation rates could cause gold's price to decline, while an uptick in inflation or comments made by Federal Reserve officials could cause gold's price to rise. Given the difficulty of precisely timing the gold market, investors should consider limited and cost-effective investments now and monitor these dates for further opportunities (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares rose 10% after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and issued a stronger-than-expected forecast for the current quarter, attributing the strong guidance to $7 billion in artificial intelligence systems expected to ship during the quarter. The company expects $2.25 in adjusted earnings per share for the current quarter, with between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion in revenue. Dell is experiencing "unprecedented demand" for AI systems, particularly from second-tier cloud providers like Coreweave, and has $14.4 billion in confirmed AI orders in its backlog. Dell also significantly increased its shareholder capital return, spending $2.4 billion on share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred described the decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list as difficult but ultimately necessary to uphold agreements. Manfred cited three factors driving the decision: the list effectively bans working in the game, Rose is part of baseball history, and Rose's original settlement agreement allowed Hall of Fame consideration. Rose died at age 83 in September 2024, but the debate about his Hall of Fame eligibility has persisted. Rose, MLB‚Äôs hit king with 4,256 career hits, received a lifetime ban in 1989 due to gambling on games, but will now be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration.</p>

          <p>The BRICS economic bloc has approved its first joint climate finance framework, marking the group's most coordinated effort to date on funding climate action. The nonbinding framework outlines BRICS priorities, including the reform of multilateral development banks, scaling up concessional finance, and mobilizing private capital to support climate efforts in the Global South. The document will be submitted to BRICS heads of state at their July meeting and is intended to set the stage for a shared position ahead of Cop30 in Brazil. The Brazilian presidency stated that this effort reflects a shift from defensive posturing to proactive coordination in international negotiations.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have declined again this week, averaging 8.14%, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money right now. While HELOC rates are low, potential borrowers should be aware that rates could rise or fall unexpectedly due to their variable nature. It's important to calculate long-term affordability closely, considering potential rate changes, and borrowers could consider refinancing into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. Homeowners contemplating the use of this product may be ready to get started (not investment advice).</p>

The team attributed the email to a mistake made by an employee in the corporate sales department. Ovechkin, who will turn 40 in September, had previously stated his intention to return for his 21st NHL season after the Capitals were eliminated from the playoffs. Ovechkin is currently pursuing Wayne Gretzky for most goals in NHL history.</p>
