        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta engaged in discussions with Runway, an artificial intelligence startup known for its AI video-generation tools, regarding a potential acquisition before deciding to invest billions in Scale AI. The talks between Meta and Runway did not progress significantly and eventually ended, according to sources familiar with the matter. Runway had previously been recognized on CNBC's Disruptor 50 list. Meta ultimately chose to pursue a different strategy by investing in Scale AI, although the specific reasons for the shift in direction remain undisclosed. This move reflects the ongoing competition among tech giants to secure a leading position in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p>

Emhoff stated he continues to disagree with his firm's decision to settle with the White House, but remains at the firm because of his faith in his colleagues‚Äô principles, which he said were demonstrated by pro bono work the firm‚Äôs attorneys from across the country did during the federal immigration raids by ICE agents and border patrol officers in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, grossing $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. Despite positive reviews, the film faced challenges in attracting audiences amid competition from other family-friendly movies and a broader trend of original animated films struggling at the box office. Analysts suggest that marketing may have played a role, with audiences potentially unfamiliar with the title and its new characters. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience throughout the summer, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and plans to continue releasing original animated intellectual property alongside sequels and existing franchises.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz, even if Iran threatens to close it amidst rising Middle East tensions. Despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, its approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its self-interests rather than direct military intervention. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. This indicates China's focus on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, surpassing the NATO target of 2%. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need for agility and a clear sense of national interest in an era of uncertainty. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then. Alongside the spending commitment, the government published its National Security Strategy which said the UK needed to be more "competitive and robust" in science, education, trade and frontier technology.</p>
