        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dongchoon Circus, South Korea's last remaining circus and the oldest in the country, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon once thrived during the golden age of South Korean circuses in the 1960s, offering exotic animal acts and various performances. However, with the rise of television, the internet, and animal rights concerns, the circus faced declining audiences and eventually became the only one of its kind left in the nation. Despite these challenges, Dongchoon continues to perform acrobatic shows at a seaside tourist area in Ansan and aims to establish a circus school to cultivate local talent, preserving a unique genre of Korean performing arts. The circus has become a popular attraction for locals and tourists alike, and its historical significance has even led to calls for its designation as an intangible cultural asset. </p>

          <h2>Businesses Employ 'Tariff Engineering' to Reduce Duty Liabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 23:15:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," a legal practice involving altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into lower-duty categories. Customs lawyers and supply chain experts explain that this strategy allows companies to benefit from exemptions carved out by the U.S. government. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into final products to qualify for a lower 25% duty, while others remove such elements to avoid higher tariffs on steel and aluminum products. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also successfully implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs. The practice, though legal, requires careful navigation to avoid misrepresenting product classifications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Zillow report suggests that certain interior paint colors can significantly boost a home's sale price. According to the study, the most desirable kitchen color is olive green, with buyers willing to pay up to $1,600 more for kitchens featuring this shade. In bedrooms, classic navy walls are preferred, potentially increasing a home's value by an estimated $1,815. Dark gray living rooms are also favored over lighter colors, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600. Conversely, bright, playful colors like lemon yellow in the kitchen or scarlet red in the bedroom may decrease a home's sale price.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is becoming increasingly strategically important, given the likelihood of sustained higher U.S. tariffs on steel products. Hashimoto believes that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, but he doubts that trade levies alone will revitalize the manufacturing sector. The company has finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, following approval from President Trump. Nippon Steel has also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, committing to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh.
