          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year program that has been central to the nation's space exploration efforts. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite for monitoring greenhouse gases. With a success rate of approximately 98%, the H2A series is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. This transition aims to enhance Japan's competitiveness in the global satellite-launch market, which is increasingly dominated by private companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered mysterious radio waves originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049, which took 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This finding suggests that the processes creating these energetic particles, possibly from supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe. The discovery opens a new window into understanding how the early universe evolved.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his best pitching performance of the season, throwing two sharp innings in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 9-5 loss to the Kansas City Royals. Working his way back from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani's fastball reached a career-high 101.7 mph, and he effectively mixed in off-speed pitches, allowing just one hit and one walk over 27 pitches. While Ohtani's outing was a significant positive, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled, and the offense couldn't overcome an early deficit, setting up a series rubber match on Sunday. The performance was an encouraging sign of his recovery.</p>

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, even as it lags significantly in advanced chip technology. Speaking at an economic summit, Shum noted that the gap in chip production is a major challenge for Chinese firms, but they are making significant strides in algorithm engineering. He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI and Google but with far less computing power, as a prime example of this progress.</p>

The woman did not see what bit her, and a drone search of the area did not locate any dangerous marine life. Swimming was temporarily suspended at the beach as a precaution but resumed the following morning after lifeguards and drones confirmed the water was clear.</p>

The lawsuit was filed by the five men after Trump, during a 2024 presidential debate, falsely claimed they had killed someone and pleaded guilty.

Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wife's household, and female offspring remained connected to their maternal homes. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>The long-standing rumor was confirmed as Britpop band Pulp was revealed to be the mystery act billed as "Patchwork" on the Glastonbury Pyramid Stage.

The performance marked the 30th anniversary of their legendary 1995 headline slot at the festival. The set was a nostalgic and triumphant moment, culminating in a communal singalong of their signature anthem, enhanced by a perfectly timed Red Arrows flypast.</p>
