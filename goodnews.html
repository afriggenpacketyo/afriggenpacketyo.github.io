          <p>Australian markets are expected to open strong following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's reelection, signaling a desire for policy stability amidst global economic uncertainty. Futures tied to the S&P/ASX 200 indicate a positive start, building on the benchmark's recent peak. Most Asian markets are closed for holidays, while U.S. futures show a slight downturn after a robust week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 achieved its longest winning streak since 2004, recovering losses incurred since April 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent elections in Canada and Australia have shown that right-wing parties emulating Trump's MAGA playbook faced setbacks, indicating a complex global impact of the former president. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an anti-Trump message, while Australia's Anthony Albanese received an anti-Trump boost, leading to victories for the center-left incumbents. However, in Germany, Friedrich Merz leveraged Trump's policies to push through spending limit suspensions, while in Britain, Keir Starmer's initial success waned as Nigel Farage's party gained ground, showcasing the unpredictable consequences of Trump's influence on international politics.</p>

The election, rerun after the annulled results of a previous vote, is being closely watched in European capitals and Washington, given Romania's strategic importance in supporting Ukraine.

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular, offering women greater control over their reproductive timelines. The procedure allows women to delay motherhood without rushing into relationships or feeling pressured by their biological clocks. Freezing eggs at a younger age increases the chances of success, and some companies now offer it as a benefit. While there are critics who caution that egg freezing doesn't guarantee a child, women view it as a way to preserve their options and make informed decisions about their futures.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing has become a mainstream option for women seeking to preserve their fertility, with procedures increasing significantly in recent years. The process involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by surgical retrieval and freezing in liquid nitrogen. While the procedure is expensive, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, it offers women the opportunity to delay childbearing and make informed decisions about their reproductive futures. The optimal time to freeze eggs is in a woman's 20s, when egg quality is at its peak.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing, a medical procedure gaining popularity among women, involves harvesting, freezing, and storing eggs for future use. While it offers women greater control over their reproductive timelines, it comes with significant financial costs.

While some employers offer coverage, the majority of women pay out of pocket, making it an expensive option for many.
