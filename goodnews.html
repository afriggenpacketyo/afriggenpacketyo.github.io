          <p>Following a legal challenge from Washington D.C. officials, the Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of the city's police department. The agreement, reached after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the administration's authority, ensures that the current Metropolitan Police Department chief, Pamela Smith, will remain in control. This development de-escalates a significant conflict over local governance and federal power, particularly regarding the enforcement of federal immigration policies within the sanctuary city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to remove the newly appointed emergency police chief for Washington D.C. and rewrite a directive on immigration enforcement following a federal court hearing. A judge expressed significant skepticism about the legality of the Trump administration's move to replace the city's police chief with a DEA administrator. This decision marks a victory for D.C. officials in their effort to maintain local control over their police force and sanctuary city policies.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first-ever accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main property it accompanies. This development is a result of a city law passed a year ago aimed at creating more accessible and affordable homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new type of housing, often called a "starter home," will serve as a model for other cities grappling with the statewide housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A recent report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of California's shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. This contradicts the long-held belief that the lakebed is a primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers now suggest that public health efforts should pivot from costly dust control projects to providing indoor air filtration for homes and schools.</p>

          <p>Challenging conventional dietary advice, two new clinical trials in India suggest that people with type 2 diabetes can consume mangoes in moderation without negative effects on their blood sugar. The research found that when mangoes replaced an equivalent amount of carbohydrates, such as bread, participants showed improvements in fasting glucose and other key metabolic markers. The findings offer hope to many who believed they had to avoid the popular fruit, emphasizing portion control and clinical supervision.</p>
