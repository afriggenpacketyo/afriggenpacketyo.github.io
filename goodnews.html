          <p>Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is reportedly interested in a move to Manchester United, despite the club's absence from Champions League football. Cunha views United as a big club and is excited by the challenge of reviving their fortunes, with the move potentially benefiting all parties involved. United, who are expected to allow Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to leave, are in need of bolstering their attacking options. Cunha has scored 27 goals in 65 Premier League appearances over the past two seasons and is seen as someone who can make an instant impact.</p>

          <p>Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, has recorded a record number of puffins, with 43,626 counted this year, despite global populations declining rapidly. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales attributes the conservation success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators and human impact. Skomer is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills. Conservationists believe the puffins are thriving due to the abundance of food and lack of predators on the island.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will receive a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold. The system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, though companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers.</p>
