          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:39:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled slightly to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March but still exceeding economists' expectations of 3%. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, the lowest since November 2024. A key factor in this moderation is the easing of rice inflation, which fell to 90.7% after two months of more than doubling, though prices remain historically high. The Bank of Japan closely monitors these figures, with some strategists suggesting the easing food inflation could support a rate hike later in the year, despite the central bank being seen as "behind the curve" in combating inflation.

          <p>Morecambe Football Club has made history as the first professional English club to be owned by Sikh investors, Panjab Warriors, who subsequently appointed Ashvir Singh Johal as the first Sikh manager of a British professional club. This landmark development is seen as a significant breakthrough for the Sikh community, which has been historically underrepresented in British football, both in the UK and globally. The new ownership group emphasizes bringing Sikh principles of discipline, trustfulness, and compassion to the club, aiming to change the narrative of football ownership. This visibility is inspiring for many, encouraging broader participation in diverse professions and setting a positive example.</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after moving abroad, expecting to save £350 million over the next five years. New rules stipulate that claimants generally become ineligible after eight weeks outside the UK, barring exceptional circumstances. A new specialist team, expanding to over 200 investigators, will utilize travel data to identify incorrect payments, building on a successful pilot that stopped £17 million in overpayments. This initiative aims to tackle benefit fraud, which has seen an increase since the pandemic, and raise awareness of eligibility rules for the benefit, accessed by 6.9 million families.</p>

          <p>Adidas has issued a public apology to the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for culturally appropriating their traditional huarache sandals in its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe design. Executives from Adidas Mexico personally delivered the apology after President Claudia Sheinbaum accused the company of exploiting Indigenous culture and vowed stronger protections. The company admitted the shoe, created by Mexican American designer Willy Chavarria, closely resembled the community's handicrafts, which are vital to their livelihood. Adidas has pledged to collaborate with the town in the future, and Oaxaca's Ministry of Culture and Arts accepted the apology as a "historic act of recognition." This marks a significant step towards respecting indigenous intellectual property.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction effectively winding down operations at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. The ruling prohibits the Trump administration and Florida from transferring new detainees or conducting further construction, ordering the removal of temporary infrastructure within 60 days. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed with environmental groups and a Native American Tribe that the government violated the National Environmental Policy Act, risking irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration policies and is celebrated as a landmark victory for environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as "one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity," suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart." Huang's comments, made during a visit to Taiwan to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip platform, come amid reports of the U.S. administration considering equity stakes in tech companies receiving CHIPS Act funding. TSMC is set to receive $6.6 billion under the act for its Arizona fabrication plants. Huang also discussed Nvidia's plans for a new Taiwan office, "NVIDIA Constellation," to support its growing workforce and supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have denied that they are passing the costs of Trump administration tariffs directly onto U.S. consumers through price increases. This refutes a Nikkei Asia report suggesting otherwise. Toyota clarified that its July price adjustments were routine annual increases reflecting operational costs, not a response to the 25% tariffs (later lowered to 15% through a trade deal). Honda attributed its ability to avoid direct tariff pass-through to its high percentage of American-made vehicles. This article highlights the complexities of international trade and how companies navigate tariff impacts while striving to maintain market competitiveness and customer affordability.

This marks the eighth flight for the reusable X-37B program, which serves as a testbed for advanced avionics, sensors, and reusable spacecraft components. While mission details are largely classified, Space Force officials disclosed two key payloads: one to test high-speed laser communications for proliferated space networks, and another a quantum navigation sensor for robust positioning in GPS-denied environments. The successful launch and booster landing underscore SpaceX's operational reliability and the Pentagon's continued investment in resilient space capabilities.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been cleared of royal defamation (lese majeste) charges by a Bangkok court, avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence. The charges stemmed from remarks made in a 2015 interview concerning the 2014 coup that ousted his sister. Thaksin's legal team successfully argued that his comments were misinterpreted. This acquittal is considered unusual, as convictions in lese majeste cases are rare in Thailand, and it significantly eases a major legal threat to his family's influential political movement. His daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, leads the Pheu Thai party and became prime minister last year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study has uncovered a novel mechanism by which corn plants communicate with their neighbors: by releasing a gas called linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this research offers crucial insights into plant interactions and their potential agricultural applications. Field surveys in China revealed that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also reduced growth, suggesting a trade-off in defense and development. Scientists believe that optimizing linalool release could be key to developing new strategies for pest control and enhancing crop yields, contributing significantly to sustainable agriculture.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company X have reached a tentative settlement with former Twitter employees who had sued for $500 million in severance pay. The agreement, reported in a court filing, will postpone an upcoming hearing to finalize the terms. This lawsuit stemmed from the mass layoffs of approximately 6,000 staff, over half the workforce, after Musk's 2022 takeover, with employees alleging they were denied promised severance benefits. The settlement marks a resolution to one of several legal challenges faced by X following the drastic cost-cutting measures. This article highlights the ongoing repercussions of major corporate restructuring and workforce reductions in the tech industry.</p>
