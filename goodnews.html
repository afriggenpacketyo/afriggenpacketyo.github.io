          <h2>American Universities Face Brain Drain as Academics Seek Opportunities Abroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 18:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American universities are experiencing an increasing brain drain as funding cuts and concerns over academic freedom prompt professors to seek positions in other countries. Historians Timothy Snyder and Marci Shore recently left Yale University for the University of Toronto, citing concerns about the direction of American democracy. Immigration specialists are assisting high-profile professors in fields like medical research, AI, and physics to relocate to Canada, Australia, and Europe, with better funding and lab support being key factors in their decisions. One American client is considering offers from Britain, Australia, and China, prioritizing research support in their final decision. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An additional 2.7 million households in Britain will receive a ¬£150 discount on their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification regarding property size, type, and home energy score is being eliminated, extending the benefit to more families, including nearly a million households with children. Energy companies will fund the expansion of the Warm Home Discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some argue that the scheme still excludes those on non-means tested benefits.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a retrial. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene of a collision, but convicted her of operating under the influence of liquor, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. The case has garnered significant public attention, including a TV show and an upcoming Netflix documentary. The defense argued that Read was framed by law enforcement officers, while the prosecution maintained that she intentionally struck O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" and its legacy as the quintessential summer blockbuster by providing a list of the highest-grossing summer movies from 1975 to 2024. The list includes iconic films such as "Star Wars," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," "Jurassic Park," and recent hits like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Barbie." These films have collectively grossed over $15 billion during the summer months, demonstrating the enduring power of summer movie season. The article notes that box office tracking before 1981 was less precise, and the summer of 2020 saw minimal activity due to the pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention, hailed as a potential "breakthrough" in curbing the epidemic. Clinical trial data suggests that the drug provides near-complete protection against HIV infection, offering a more convenient alternative to daily pills. However, the high cost of approximately $28,000 a year may limit access for many, particularly in countries with the highest HIV burden. While Gilead Sciences is taking steps to broaden access, the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid could hinder the drug's reach in affected nations.</p>

          <p>Experts have weighed in on the potential environmental risks associated with the U.S. using "bunker buster" bombs on Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. The site is believed to be processing uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas. Experts suggest that any contamination from a strike would likely be localized due to the gas's heavy molecular weight. While uranium isotopes pose a relatively low level of hazard, the reaction of uranium hexafluoride with water could form hydrofluoric acid, an acutely hazardous material, however, experts have confidence that the dangers are not severe. </p>
