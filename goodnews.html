          <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, potentially lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products and taxes on US tech companies. However, the specifics of the agreement are unclear, and any deal would require Congressional approval. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted reducing food production standards, prioritizing a separate agreement with the EU. The announcement follows Trump's imposition of tariffs on trading partners last month.</p>

          <p>The New York Times explores the ethical implications of using AI to create an avatar of the late Agatha Christie for an online writing course.

The article discusses the broader debate around AI and artistic copyright, highlighting the complexities of using AI to resurrect deceased figures for entertainment and education.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are using powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope, to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. The study estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. These findings could help select landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon.</p>
