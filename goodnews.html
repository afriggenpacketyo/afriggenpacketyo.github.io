          <p>Mike Novogratz detailed the arduous four-year journey and over $25 million spent to list his crypto firm, Galaxy Digital, on the Nasdaq, calling the experience "unfair, infuriating". He noted the extensive regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, requiring nine rounds of comments, and significantly higher auditing costs compared to traditional financial firms. Novogratz believes the regulatory environment has forced crypto firms to be well capitalized. Galaxy Digital's listing is one of the first major fintech IPOs since 2021, signaling renewed investor interest in crypto-adjacent companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament debated and approved changes to a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance in ending their lives. One approved amendment ensures that no staff member, including social care workers and pharmacists, would be forced to participate in the assisted dying process against their wishes. The debate was emotionally charged, with supporters arguing the bill had been strengthened by previous changes, while opponents expressed concerns about potential coercion and the need for stronger protections for vulnerable individuals. Further debate and voting on additional amendments are scheduled for June 13, followed by a vote on the bill's overall passage.</p>
