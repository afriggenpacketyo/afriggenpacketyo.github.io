          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the Memorial Tournament, finishing at 10-under 278 and winning by four strokes, joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners. Despite a strong challenge from Ben Griffin, who closed within two shots late in the round, Scheffler's consistent play and Griffin's late double bogey secured Scheffler's win. This marks Scheffler's third win in his last four starts, further solidifying his position as world number one, while tournament host Jack Nicklaus praised Scheffler's performance, noting similarities to his own playing style. The performances on the course led to a final score that resulted in Scheffler taking home the top prize.</p>

          <p>Transgender student athlete AB Hernandez competed in the California track-and-field championships, winning first-place medals in both high jump and triple jump, despite facing national scrutiny and protests. The California Interscholastic Federation implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports, and former President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the state if Hernandez competed. Despite the controversy, the events continued without disruption, with some high school coaches offering support for Hernandez.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing and returning her pardon issued by Trump. Hemphill believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine the legitimacy of the legal proceedings, stating that she and others involved were guilty. She worked with Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons to use in court, and she expects her protest to garner attention from Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 60 Minutes report explores why Australian actors are overrepresented in Hollywood, citing factors such as strong training grounds like NIDA, a 'can-do' attitude, and a lack of self-importance. NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, provides rigorous training in the classics and accent work, while Aussie soap operas offer actors a testing ground to hone their skills. The report also highlights the influence of figures like John Clark, NIDA's former director, who fostered a distinct Aussie mode of acting, and the importance of institutions like the Sydney Theatre Company. The report concludes that the remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from the pressures of Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won the Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, by four strokes, continuing his impressive run of form. Scheffler shot a two-under-par 70 in the final round to secure the victory over Ben Griffin, who faltered on the back nine after briefly closing the gap. This win marks Scheffler's third triumph in his last four tournaments, following his recent victory at the PGA Championship, and it also makes him only the second player, after Tiger Woods, to win the Memorial in consecutive years. Scheffler's consistent performance and ability to maintain composure under pressure led to his success in the tournament.</p>
