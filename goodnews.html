          <h2>Experts Assess Iran's Strait of Hormuz Closure Threat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 03:03:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; however, experts suggest the likelihood of closure is minimal. Closing the strait would risk alienating Iran's neighbors, provoking hostilities, and harming its trade relations, particularly with China, a major importer of Iranian oil. Analysts believe Iran has little to gain and much to lose by disrupting oil flows, potentially making it a target for U.S. and Israeli military action, and therefore the closure is unlikely. The stability of the strait is in China's best interest given its dependence on Gulf oil flows.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, driven by U.S. pressure to address ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. While some member states are aligned with this target, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold, creating potential friction during the summit in The Hague. The U.S. seeks concrete plans and commitments from allies, but some European nations may attempt to dilute their pledges, leading to potential clashes. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for long-term commitments and investment contracts to scale up production capabilities.</p>

The plan includes a British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme that could cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, exempting them from certain green energy levies. The strategy also aims to create over one million new jobs in the next decade and focuses on upskilling the workforce, attracting global talent, and streamlining planning processes.

Alcaraz, who initially had no expectations for the grass-court season, quickly adapted and demonstrated dominant form, making him a top contender for the upcoming tournament. Winning Queen's is a positive sign for Alcaraz, as he also won the title in 2023 before triumphing at Wimbledon, and his current form suggests he is the player to beat.

While ketamine is not officially licensed for depression treatment, it can be prescribed 'off-label' and is believed to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy.
