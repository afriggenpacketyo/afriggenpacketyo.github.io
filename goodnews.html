          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants 5-2 in an 11-inning game, concluding the first half of the season with a significant series victory. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a standout performance, pitching seven scoreless innings and solidifying his All-Star status. However, the team's bullpen struggles continued as closer Tanner Scott gave up a two-run homer in the ninth, blowing the initial lead. The Dodgers' offense ultimately rallied in the 11th inning, securing the win and maintaining their lead in the National League West.</p>

          <p>After a shaky start with a loss to France, England's women's football team has secured a place in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with decisive victories over the Netherlands and Wales. The team's response to the initial defeat has created a sense of urgency and momentum, with manager Sarina Wiegman praising the players' resilience. They are now set to face Sweden in a highly anticipated match, a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final. Analysts note that while England has found a successful formation, Sweden will present a strong, physical, and counter-attacking challenge.</p>

          <p>King Charles has invited President Donald Trump for a second state visit to the UK, strategically scheduled for September 17-19 when the House of Commons is in recess. This timing effectively prevents the possibility of Trump addressing Parliament, an honor given to past presidents like Obama and Macron but one that would have been controversial for Trump. The visit is seen as a political win for the White House but also a point of contention, with some MPs having formally opposed the idea of a parliamentary speech due to the president's past rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that U.S. President Donald Trump, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, will undertake a second state visit to the UK from September 17-19. King Charles III will host the couple at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace is under renovation. This visit is unusual, as second-term presidents are typically not offered a full state visit. The event will include a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, with senior royals in attendance, though it is unlikely to feature public-facing events due to security concerns from his controversial 2019 visit.</p>

          <p>The perception of lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is transforming from an association with gangs and crime to a celebrated form of community art and heritage. Originally a post-WWII counter-culture statement for Mexican Americans, lowriders are now seen as moving art exhibits. The article highlights how car clubs and artists are becoming community-focused, using their passion to mentor youth and host charitable drives in Española, the self-proclaimed "lowrider capital of the world." This shift was marked by Santa Fe officially declaring a "Lowrider Day" in 2016, embracing the culture as an important part of the state's identity.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer advised investors to separate their political feelings about President Donald Trump from their financial decisions. He argued that despite personal objections one might have to the president, the stock market has shown remarkable resiliency, driven by individual investors. Cramer posits that a combination of a pro-capitalist agency environment, the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence, and pro-business policies are creating a positive environment for stocks. He suggests that even if one dislikes the president, the current conditions are creating a bull market that investors should not ignore. (not investment advice)</p>
