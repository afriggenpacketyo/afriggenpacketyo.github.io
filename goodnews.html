          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are expected to meet the long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the newer, more ambitious goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting that sales growth for the current quarter will remain above 50%. This performance signals sustained high demand for its processors, which are crucial for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite the strong results and positive outlook, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading, as its data center revenue came in just short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The company also announced an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison. The role, which serves as a key contact for productions navigating city bureaucracy, had been vacant since Bass took office, causing frustration within the entertainment industry. The appointment comes at a critical time as Los Angeles faces a production slump and increasing competition from other locations offering better incentives, making the liaison's role vital for retaining film and TV jobs.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, which will provide working parents of children aged nine months to three years with 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week during term time. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply for the new entitlement, which begins in September. While the program aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare, concerns persist among providers and charities regarding insufficient government funding rates, potential staff shortages, and the availability of enough places to meet the expected high demand.</p>

          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under a tax exemption has more than doubled in the last year, reaching £3 billion. This surge is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Currently, imports valued at £135 or less are exempt from customs duties, a rule the UK government is now reviewing following pressure from British retailers who argue the loophole creates unfair competition. Business owners are calling for swift action to level the playing field and protect consumers from potentially unregulated goods.</p>

          <p>A UK charity named Greater Change is finding success with a model that provides direct cash payments to individuals who are homeless or at risk of losing their homes. The approach gives recipients the autonomy to spend the money on what they need most, such as rent deposits, bills, or debt repayment, which the charity says provides them with the "dignity of choice." The organization reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, with nearly half finding employment, suggesting that direct financial intervention can be a highly effective tool.</p>

Wilson describes the book as both the easiest and hardest she has written, as she felt a deep connection to the characters but also a responsibility to portray their adult lives with the same realism and emotional honesty that defined the original story.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle industry has undergone a massive expansion, positioning the country as a dominant force in the global car market. Companies like BYD have overtaken established players like Tesla in production, fueled by significant government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a robust battery supply chain. This rapid growth has led China to become the world's largest vehicle exporter, prompting regulatory scrutiny and new tariffs from the United States and the European Union, which are seeking to protect their domestic auto industries from the flood of competitive Chinese EVs.</p>
