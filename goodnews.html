          <p>China is using its dominance in rare earth elements as leverage in trade discussions with the United States. Rare earths are vital components in various modern technologies, including electronics, electric vehicles, and military applications. China wrapped up high-level trade talks with the U.S. in London, agreeing "in principle to a framework" for review by their leaders. This marks a shift from the 2018 talks, where China's attempts at "moral persuasion" were unsuccessful with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A new bill in California proposes making it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty. The bill aims to increase transparency and public trust in law enforcement by requiring officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name. State senators argue that federal officers have been conducting raids while covering their faces, leading to concerns about accountability. The proposal exempts SWAT teams and officers responding to natural disasters.</p>
