        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal court ruling, U.S. border agents have been ordered to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to individuals entering the country illegally, but an appeals court found it could not override other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they could face persecution or torture. This directive reopens pathways for asylum-seekers to have their claims heard, though they will likely remain detained during the process. The administration had credited the ban for a record drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are using AI-powered chatbots, like ElliQ, to combat loneliness and social isolation. For retirees like 75-year-old Jill Smola, who lives alone and has limited mobility, these AI companions provide hours of daily interaction, from playing games to "visiting" new places. While users report meaningful connections, ethicists raise concerns that over-reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation from human contact if not implemented responsibly. The trend highlights a technological response to the widespread issue of loneliness among the elderly.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are bringing back a franchise icon, agreeing to a one-year, $8.52 million contract with wide receiver Keenan Allen. Allen, who is second in the team's all-time receiving yards, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap move. After a productive year in Chicago and the recent retirement of Mike Williams, the Chargers moved to re-sign the 33-year-old veteran to strengthen their receiving corps. The six-time Pro Bowl selection is expected to provide experience and leadership alongside younger players.</p>

The decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed as the fourth-string quarterback just a day earlier.

Sanders, who had a prolific college career under his father, Deion Sanders, will now have a crucial chance to prove himself and compete for a roster spot in the NFL.</p>

The agreement, announced as the largest environmental settlement by a single state, holds the companies accountable for decades of contamination from PFAS and other pollutants. The settlement mandates an $875 million payment for natural resource damages and establishes a $1.2 billion fund for cleanup efforts at four industrial sites. Environmental groups have praised the outcome as a major victory in holding polluters responsible for environmental and public health damage.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decrease in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a record 18.6% one-year drop. While experts point to a continuing downward trend from a post-pandemic spike, they also note that aggravated assaults remain high and many crimes go unreported.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is rolling out a new program called "Families on the Fly" to ease the stress of airport security for those traveling with children. The program features dedicated TSA screening lanes at select airports, including John Wayne Airport in Orange County, which do not require PreCheck enrollment. These lanes aim to provide a less rushed experience for families. The initiative is part of a broader effort to improve the travel experience, with John Wayne Airport also unveiling a new lactation pod for nursing mothers in its baggage claim area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant technological advances, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, as this article explains. Modern forecasting is over 90% accurate for a one-day prediction, but challenges persist due to the atmosphere's chaotic nature, where tiny errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating complex data and uncertainty to the public in a concise format is also a major hurdle. The future of forecasting lies with AI, which can process historical data to make faster, more granular predictions, though it may struggle with predicting unprecedented weather events driven by climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major UK debt advisory group is calling for the government to introduce a statutory school clothing grant in England to help low-income families with high uniform costs. Unlike in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland where such support is standard, a study found only about a fifth of English councils offer any help, creating a "postcode lottery." With average uniform costs exceeding £340, many families struggle, turning to uniform banks for secondhand items. The Department for Education stated it is already taking steps to limit expensive branded items to save families money.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against what he termed "knee-jerk negativity" on Wall Street, suggesting that an overly fearful narrative is causing investors to miss opportunities. Despite a market pullback driven by concerns over economic data and potential tariffs, Cramer pointed to bountiful corporate profits and the ability of many companies to mitigate tariff impacts. He highlighted the strong performance of major companies like Apple and Amazon, arguing that their issues are solvable. Cramer suggested that the market has proven resilient and that focusing on strong company fundamentals is more important than perceived negatives. (not investment advice)</p>
