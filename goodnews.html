The State Department does not anticipate offering direct U.S. government-assisted departure from Iran, advising Americans there to use existing means to leave.

Khalil's attorneys argued that the government was violating his free speech rights due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests.

          <p>President Trump stated on social media that his administration is close to reaching a 'deal' with Harvard University, with a potential announcement next week. This announcement coincides with a federal judge granting a preliminary injunction to block the administration's efforts to bar international students from attending Harvard. The Trump administration has taken actions against Harvard's international students, including disqualifying them from receiving visas, citing the university's alleged failure to account for "known illegal activity" by students.</p>

          <p>A study from the University of Chicago Medicine and Columbia University suggests that consuming more fruits and vegetables could lead to more restful sleep. The study found that adults who reported eating more fruits and vegetables experienced deeper, more uninterrupted sleep.

Experts advise that a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables is beneficial for long-term sleep health.</p>
