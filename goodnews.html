        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Severe drought in Iraq has caused water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir to drop, leading to the discovery of approximately 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists believe the tombs, unearthed in the Duhok province, date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating impacts on agriculture and electricity, it has created opportunities for archaeological excavation in areas previously submerged. The team is working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before water levels rise again.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's absence from public events for four days has triggered a wave of speculation and rumors on social media, with hashtags like #whereistrump trending. While the White House has not commented, Trump has been active on his Truth Social platform, though some commentators have questioned if the writing style is his. The speculation follows recent questions about his health and comments from Vice President JD Vance about his readiness to assume the presidency. A global affairs reporter for Axios later confirmed seeing the President's motorcade, stating he was scheduled to play golf.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor and author attributes his "razor sharp" memory to five daily practices he has maintained for years. His routine includes regular social interaction, lifelong learning by reading on new subjects, and using an organizational system like color-coded notes to manage tasks. He also emphasizes the importance of daily physical activity, such as swimming and walking, and a healthy diet rich in nutrients, along with adequate sleep and hydration. He advocates for an intentional and proactive approach to cognitive health, treating it with the same dedication as a full-time job.</p>

They journeyed over 9,000 miles from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance non-stop. The trio endured numerous hardships, including storms and being swept overboard, while raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. Their arrival was celebrated by family and supporters as they played bagpipes entering the marina.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is experiencing a resurgence in its domestic market, with executives citing success in winning "consumer mindshare." The company's New York-listed shares rose significantly after a strong earnings report, boosted by its Taobao Instant Commerce initiative launched in April. CEO Eddie Wu stated that user growth and consumer preference for the platform have exceeded expectations, positioning the company for long-term efficiency. This growth is attributed to meeting consumer demand for on-demand delivery across a wide array of product categories, from groceries to electronics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Commentary: Taylor Swift's Engagement Becomes a Canvas for Political and Social Projection</h2>

          <p>The engagement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce has sparked a wide range of theories and commentary, reflecting various cultural and political anxieties. The article notes how different groups are projecting their own narratives onto the event, from "Gaylors" who believe Swift is secretly queer, to conservatives like Charlie Kirk who hope marriage will "deradicalize" her into a conservative supporter. Even Vice President JD Vance has weighed in, floating a conspiracy theory about the NFL rigging games for Kelce's team. The author suggests this intense speculation highlights the singer's immense cultural influence and how her personal life has become a battleground for competing ideologies.</p>

          <h2>Princeton University Tops Ranking of Private Colleges for Best Return on Investment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the private colleges in the U.S. that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University taking the top spot. The analysis considered factors like financial aid, academic rigor, and post-graduation earnings. While Princeton's tuition is over $65,000, the average student on financial aid pays just over $10,500 and earns a median income of $110,000 a decade later. The list also includes Caltech, MIT, and Stanford, highlighting how generous financial aid policies at well-endowed universities can make expensive schools a valuable long-term investment.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist investment firm, has announced it has taken a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California market. While Rexford benefits from a prime portfolio, its stock has underperformed, trading at a discount to its net asset value. This is attributed to poor corporate governance, including a Maryland incorporation that is friendly to management entrenchment, and high executive compensation. Elliott is expected to push for changes in governance and capital allocation, and their involvement may also attract acquisition interest from other investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A North Carolina pastor, Kelvis Reid, is recovering after a life-saving heart and kidney transplant to treat AL amyloidosis, a rare and aggressive disease. The condition caused abnormal proteins to build up on his organs, making his heart "hard like cement" and leading to a major cardiac arrest. After weeks on life support, his doctors successfully advocated for him to receive the double transplant. Eighteen months later, Reid has returned to his pulpit and recently participated in a 5K run, inspiring others to be vigilant about their health.</p>

          <p>The landscape of Indian food in the United States is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from a reputation for cheap buffets to a burgeoning upscale and fine-dining scene. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna, whose restaurants have earned Michelin stars and massive waitlists, are leading the charge. This shift is driven by a growing American interest in global and hyper-regional flavors, as well as an increasingly affluent Indian American population. As a result, investor interest is growing, with private equity firms now backing popular Indian restaurant chains looking to expand in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>A new book explores why China can build massive infrastructure projects at a "breakneck" speed while the U.S. struggles. The author posits that China is an "engineering state," run by leaders with technical backgrounds who view society as a problem to be solved, leading to monumental projects like high-speed rail. In contrast, the U.S. is a "lawyerly society" where legal processes, regulations, and litigation often lead to paralysis and gridlock. While the engineering mindset allows for rapid progress, it has also led to brutal social engineering policies, such as the one-child policy.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has announced that he recently received treatment to remove a basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. In an Instagram post, the 58-year-old shared a photo of his face post-treatment and thanked his medical team for their quick work. He used the opportunity to urge his followers to use sunscreen, especially during the weekend. Basal cell carcinoma is one of the main types of non-melanoma skin cancer, often caused by sun exposure, and is typically easily treated when caught early.</p>
