          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to a key climate assessment report, two major US scientific societies, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), announced a collaboration to produce peer-reviewed research on climate change impacts. This effort aims to sustain the momentum of the sixth National Climate Assessment, providing a platform for continued scientific work on climate change. The AMS and AGU emphasize the importance of preparing communities for the increasing risks of climate change.</p>
