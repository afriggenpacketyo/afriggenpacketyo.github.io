          <p>Rookie quarterback JJ McCarthy, making his long-awaited NFL debut, led the Minnesota Vikings to a thrilling 27-24 comeback win against the Chicago Bears on Monday night. After struggling through the first three quarters, McCarthy orchestrated a remarkable turnaround, throwing two fourth-quarter touchdown passes and running for another score. The former Michigan star, drafted tenth overall in 2024, completed 13 of 20 passes for 143 yards, overcoming an early interception returned for a touchdown. This impressive performance, which included a 59-yard field goal from Will Reichard, delivered a crucial season-opening victory for the Vikings, highlighting McCarthy's clutch potential.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged 0.9% to a record high of over 44,000, extending its rally after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. The technology sector led these gains, with Advantest and Tokyo Electron seeing significant increases, reflecting strong market confidence. Investors are anticipating that the next leader from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party could introduce new fiscal stimulus measures to bolster the economy. While near-term volatility is expected, analysts at Julius Baer forecast further upside, predicting the Nikkei 225 could reach 46,000 in 12 months, signaling a more stable and pro-growth environment for equities.

          <p>Boeing aircraft orders have become a consistent element in President Trump's bilateral trade deals, serving as a high-profile symbol of trade commitment. Countries like South Korea, Japan, and the UK have announced large Boeing purchases alongside trade agreements, signaling their intent to reduce trade surpluses with the U.S. Experts suggest these deals are both performative, offering visible statements of trade and boosting the president's image, and pragmatic, as the surging international tourism industry drives genuine demand for new aircraft. Boeing's iconic American status and the long delivery windows for orders also make them ideal for such agreements, despite recent safety concerns surrounding the company.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has reached an agreement on the succession of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, confirming his eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will take control of entities including Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. This settlement resolves litigation where other siblings contested Rupert's initial efforts to install Lachlan as sole successor, breaking from a previous agreement. The new arrangement establishes a trust, with Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch exchanging their holdings for an estimated $3.3 billion. This ensures the continuation of the family's conservative political orientation in its influential media outlets, which have significantly shaped political discourse globally.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy has returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers lineup after his second stint on the injured list, starting at third base and batting cleanup against the Colorado Rockies. His return is a significant boost for the struggling Dodgers, who had a losing record in his 23-game absence due to an oblique injury. Muncy, who was hitting .258 with 17 homers and 64 RBIs before his injury, aims to contribute by simply being himself and not overdoing it. He is the first of several key players expected to return, with left-hander Alex Vesia and utility player Tommy Edman also nearing activation, providing a much-needed cavalry for the team's playoff stretch drive.</p>

          <p>China's Liaoning Port Group is launching a "durian express" shipping service and building a transit center in Dalian to significantly expedite the import of durians from Southeast Asia to northeastern China. This initiative aims to reduce shipment times from up to 12 days to as little as six, ensuring fresher deliveries for the region's roughly 100 million consumers. Northeast China is currently an underpenetrated market for durians compared to southern and eastern China, facing logistical challenges due to its distance from traditional entry points. The project seeks to capitalize on growing consumer curiosity and demand for the pungent fruit in the region, thereby enhancing trade efficiency and market access.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Assembly Bill 519, a measure designed to ban online pet dealer websites and middlemen posing as local breeders from selling dogs to consumers. This bill aims to close loopholes that allowed deceptive practices, as highlighted by a Times investigation revealing how commercially bred dogs from out-of-state puppy mills were resold. The legislation, which applies to dogs, cats, and rabbits under one year old, builds on California's 2019 ban on pet store sales of commercially bred animals. Attorney General Rob Bonta supports the bill, emphasizing its importance in combating deceptive sales tactics and protecting families from the financial and emotional harm of unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred pets.</p>

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed vaccine availability for all patients after consulting with a doctor. The CDC lists numerous conditions, from asthma to obesity, making an estimated 100-200 million people eligible under this new framework. While vaccines are expected at many pharmacies and doctor's offices, access may vary for pregnant people and children due to updated recommendations and state regulations. Coverage by public insurance is expected, but private insurance interpretation and the need for documentation remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>John Elkann, chair of Ferrari and Stellantis, along with his siblings Lapo and Ginerva, has agreed to one year of community service and a joint payment of €183 million to Italian tax authorities. This settlement resolves a dispute over inheritance tax related to their grandmother's estate, Marella Caracciolo, who died in 2019. Prosecutors had alleged the Elkann siblings failed to declare significant assets and income, claiming their grandmother was a Swiss resident. Elkann's lawyer stated the agreement does not include an admission of liability, viewing it as an opportunity to swiftly close a "painful affair." This outcome mirrors his siblings, for whom dismissal of criminal charges has been requested.</p>
