          <p>Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum showed promising chemistry in the Sparks' recent game against the Atlanta Dream, combining for 39 points in a narrow 88-82 loss. The duo's performance highlighted their potential to elevate the franchise, but their efforts ultimately fell short. Rickea Jackson's return provided a boost, but the Sparks need more depth to support their starters and rookies in high-pressure situations. Despite the loss, the second-half rally fueled by Plum and Hamby offers a glimpse of what the Sparks can achieve as they continue to build their team dynamics.</p>

Under the system, companies will receive emission allowances and can trade carbon credits if they exceed or fall below their limits.

          <p>Trump administration's actions against Harvard, including barring international students and freezing funding, have fostered unity on campus. Students and faculty, previously divided over issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are now united in defending the university. The administration's actions are seen as an attack on academic freedom and higher education. The campus community has organized rallies and legal challenges to oppose the Trump administration's measures.</p>

          <p>The CDC will no longer recommend routine Covid-19 shots for healthy children, citing a lack of supporting data. This change reflects ongoing debate among medical researchers about Covid's risk to children and the necessity of annual vaccines. While the original vaccine course offered protection against serious illness, the need for annual shots is contentious. The decision comes amid varying opinions on long Covid risks and the overall benefit of vaccination for children with existing immunity.</p>
