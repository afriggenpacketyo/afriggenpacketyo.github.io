          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has successfully cultivated a relationship with President Trump, leading to a new trade agreement between the UK and the US. The details of the agreement, announced by Mr. Trump on social media, are still emerging, but it is expected to significantly strengthen ties between the two nations. While the deal could face scrutiny from British farmers concerned about American imports, it marks a political win for Starmer, who has acted as a bridge between Europe and the US and has avoided criticizing Trump. The agreement is seen as a symbol of enduring ties between Britain and the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump briefly floated the idea of imposing a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, causing concern in Hollywood. The proposal, later walked back by the White House, aimed to address the industry's challenges, including fewer movies being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax incentives overseas. While Hollywood enjoys a trade surplus, Trump's suggestion highlighted the ongoing debate over how to bolster American film production, with some advocating for tax credits instead of tariffs. The article also touches on broader economic issues, including trade tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady amidst tariff uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are anticipated to announce a trade deal, potentially easing the impact of President Trump's tariffs and providing a political boost to Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agricultural products, though the UK government remains committed to maintaining its food standards. The deal is viewed as symbolically important, though it may not significantly address the broader trade deficit concerns driving Trump's protectionist policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that new trade deals could be announced this week, with a focus on reaching agreements with key economic partners before a 90-day pause on tariffs expires. Negotiations are underway with various countries, including the UK, Canada, Italy, India, and Japan, while talks with China remain uncertain. Experts predict that any potential agreements are likely to be nonbinding and focus on key issues, with promises to negotiate further details later.</p>
