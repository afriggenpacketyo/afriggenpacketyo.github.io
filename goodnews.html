          <p>Bubba Wallace made history by becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His victory in the Brickyard 400 on Sunday marked his third career win and snapped a 100-race winless streak. Wallace had to endure a late rain delay and two overtime restarts, holding off a charging Kyle Larson to secure the win. The triumph is a significant achievement for Wallace and the 23XI Racing team, co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated American musician, satirist, and Harvard-trained mathematician, has passed away at the age of 97. Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs in the 1950s and 60s, he gained a cult following with tracks like "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Elements." Despite his popularity and influence on later comedians, Lehrer largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to teach mathematics. In 2020, he famously placed all of his work into the public domain, relinquishing all copyrights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Yankees have placed star slugger Aaron Judge on the 10-day injured list due to a right flexor strain. An MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, calming fears that he might require Tommy John surgery and a much longer recovery period. Judge, who received a platelet-rich plasma injection, could return to the lineup in as little as 10 to 14 days. The team is hopeful for a swift return, as Judge was having another MVP-caliber season, leading the majors in several offensive categories.</p>
