          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), planning to trade under the ticker symbol "FIG." This move comes after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion termination fee paid to Figma. The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a net income of $44.9 million. The filing is part of a recent uptick in tech IPOs, signaling renewed confidence in public markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant increase after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of a major legislative bill. The tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the industry. While industry groups expressed relief, they also cautioned that the overall bill still contains provisions that are harmful to the future of renewable energy in the U.S., such as the phasing out of key tax credits. The removal of the tax provided a short-term boost to the market, though long-term concerns for the sector remain. (not investment advice)</p>

While the companies state it is "business as usual" for now, Santander has not ruled out future branch closures or job cuts, particularly in back-office roles where there is duplication.

          <p>The new film "40 Acres" is a post-apocalyptic thriller starring Danielle Deadwyler as Hailey Freeman, a military veteran protecting her family on an isolated farm in a world ravaged by a pandemic and famine. The article praises Deadwyler's performance, which grounds the film's grim tone by portraying a character whose strength is rooted in generational trauma and pain. Directed by R.T. Thorne, the movie is described as a resolute portrait of a woman's desperate self-reliance, though it is sometimes heavy-handed in its themes.

The 23-year-old Draper, who is seen as the host nation's best hope for success, delivered a confident and commanding performance in the one hour and 14 minutes of play.

This change addresses concerns that AI companies are training their models on vast amounts of web content without permission or compensation, which deprives original publishers of traffic and ad revenue.

The Senate version proposes a deduction of up to $6,000 per eligible taxpayer, while the House version calls for $4,000, available from 2025 through 2028. This measure is being presented as a way to fulfill President Trump's campaign promise to reduce taxes on Social Security, though it does not eliminate the taxation of benefits directly.

Under current law, the credit is set to revert from $2,000 to $1,000 after 2025. However, because the credit is only partially refundable, families with very low incomes who do not owe federal taxes may not be able to access the full value of the expanded credit.

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has ordered the Trump administration to halt its planned mass layoffs and reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted a preliminary injunction, stating the states who brought the lawsuit had shown "irreparable harm" and that the administration's plan was likely "arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law." The ruling blocks HHS from finalizing the layoffs of over 10,000 employees and restructuring critical agencies like the CDC and FDA, which the judge noted was outside the executive branch's authority.</p>
