          <p>The article delves into the origins of Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish, exploring whether it started as a joke by the English or a genuine culinary creation. Various theories suggest it originated from poor farmers substituting cheese for meat or English pubs mocking the Welsh for not affording rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves argues that rarebit is associated with Welsh culture, with cheese being a vital part of the Welsh diet. The dish gained popularity across social classes and eventually evolved into Welsh rarebit. The differing accounts highlight the complex history and cultural significance of this dish.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian truck drivers were unaware of their involvement in transporting platforms used for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes. The drones were hidden in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, which were loaded onto the trucks and remotely opened to conduct the operation. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine used only its own weapons in the attack, without deploying equipment from its allies. The attack reportedly damaged over 40 Russian bombers, significantly impacting Russia's strategic bomber fleet.

The ruling has been celebrated by instructors and participants who view outdoor yoga as a valuable service for the community.
