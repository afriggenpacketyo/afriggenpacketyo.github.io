          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an exclusive interview. He stated that while no final deal was reached to end the war in Ukraine, significant progress was made, and he believes Putin is open to peace. Trump indicated that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European nations, and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal." The article lists his perspectives, including his belief that the war would not have happened under his presidency and that Russia now respects the U.S.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump stated that key points regarding the end of the Ukraine war have been "largely agreed on." In a television interview, he indicated that these points include potential land swaps, an expansion of Russian territory, and U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine outside of NATO. Trump described the three-hour summit in Anchorage, Alaska as a "very warm meeting" and claimed that both sides are "pretty close to a deal."

          <p>The Department of Justice has agreed to reverse its decision to install a new emergency police chief for Washington D.C. following an emergency court hearing. The city had sued the Trump administration, calling the move an illegal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the agreement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, and the administration will rewrite a directive that had sought to end the city's "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This development marks a significant scaling back of the federal intervention into the city's local law enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>South Korean girl group Blackpink performed a sold-out headline show at London's Wembley Stadium, becoming the first K-pop girl band to achieve this milestone. The concert was part of their Deadline world tour and featured a high-energy set of their greatest hits and solo performances from members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The show was praised for its intricate choreography and the strong connection between the band members and the 70,000-strong audience. The tour is expected to break the band's own record for the highest-grossing tour by a female group.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designed to be sold separately from the main property, like a condominium. This development comes a year after the city enacted a pioneering law to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. ADUs, often called granny flats or backyard cottages, are seen as a key strategy to address the state's housing crisis by increasing density in existing neighborhoods. Officials hope this first-of-its-kind project will serve as a model for other cities and help generate a new supply of starter homes.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, recently fulfilled a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Gabriel, a former conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, was invited by the Illinois band's conductor, Bruce Moss, who humorously drafted the agreement in the early 2000s. Though unable to travel due to his health, Gabriel honored his commitment by conducting the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The event celebrated his long life and unwavering dedication to his word and his passion for music.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline is a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This conclusion challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary source of the region's poor air quality, which contributes to high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that pollution from agriculture, traffic, and other sources is more significant. The study's authors recommend shifting focus from shoreline dust control projects to protecting residents directly through measures like indoor air filtration and public health alerts.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Afzal Khan has resigned from his position as the UK's trade envoy to Turkey after facing criticism for a personal visit to the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UK does not officially recognize the territory, which has been occupied by Turkish troops since 1974. During the trip, Khan met with Turkish-Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, a move condemned by the Cypriot government. In his resignation letter, Khan stated that the visit was made in a personal capacity and was unrelated to his official role, but he was stepping down to avoid becoming a distraction.</p>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. The studies found that consuming a controlled amount of certain mango varieties in place of other carbohydrates, like white bread, produced a similar or even lower glycemic response. An eight-week trial showed that participants with type 2 diabetes who ate 250g of mango for breakfast saw improvements in key metabolic health markers. Researchers emphasize that moderation is crucial and the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption, but suggest the fruit can be part of a managed diet.</p>

The artwork is part of a larger mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win and is located on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that he altered the famous image of Bryant to fit the Dodgers theme while still capturing his "Mamba mentality."
