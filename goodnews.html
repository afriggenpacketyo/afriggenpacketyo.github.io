          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is providing crucial support to foster youth transitioning to college by supplying them with essential dorm room items. Many students from the foster system arrive on campus with minimal belongings, often unaware of the basic necessities required for dorm life, such as bedding, lamps, or even cleaning supplies. The initiative, which began after a program manager learned of a student arriving at UC Berkeley with only a trash bag of possessions, aims to level the playing field. By providing these items, the program helps alleviate financial burdens and reduces feelings of otherness, allowing students to focus on their education.</p>

          <p>A couple saved the world's oldest operating drive-in theater, Shankweiler's in Orefield, Pennsylvania, by taking out a $1 million loan to purchase it in 2022. Facing the threat of the historic site being sold to developers, Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney used their life savings and the loan to preserve the theater, which first opened in 1934. After a challenging first year, the business became profitable in 2024, generating nearly $550,000 in revenue. The new owners have modernized operations and introduced community events to boost attendance, ensuring the cultural landmark continues to serve its community.</p>

Following the incident, where a fan was ejected, Semenyo received widespread support from teammates, opposing players, and fans, which he highlighted in a social media post. The Premier League and Merseyside Police have launched investigations, with officials vowing that anyone found guilty will be banned from stadiums. The event has reignited discussions about the persistence of racism in the sport and the effectiveness of current anti-racism campaigns.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, largely driven by the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share increased from 23% to 31%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to data from Canalys. This shift reflects Samsung's strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly models to high-end foldables like the Z Fold 7. Apple is expected to respond with a slimmer iPhone model and may release its own foldable phone by 2026 to compete in this evolving market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fugitive crime boss, Jamie Rothwell, was brought to justice after inadvertently revealing his location to police by sharing a selfie on the encrypted EncroChat network. Believing the platform was secure, Rothwell used it to manage a multi-million-pound drug and weapons trafficking operation from his apartment in Barcelona. The hack of the EncroChat system by law enforcement in 2020 exposed his criminal activities, including ordering a gangland shooting that injured an innocent man. The shared photos provided detectives with the final evidence needed to identify and locate him, leading to his arrest and subsequent 43-year prison sentence.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Outlines Three Steps to Cultivate Greater Emotional Endurance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests that building emotional endurance—the capacity to handle stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings—can make personal growth less grueling. She recommends three key steps: using a visual aid to understand that struggle is part of the learning process, engaging in positive and supportive self-talk to reframe difficult moments, and undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone. By practicing these techniques, individuals can learn to tolerate discomfort more effectively, which builds resilience and confidence over time, making it easier to tackle larger challenges.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest point since tracking began in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and growing public concern over the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate consumption is unhealthy. The decline is particularly sharp among underage individuals, with significantly fewer high school students reporting alcohol use compared to the late 1990s. This societal shift is viewed as positive for public health, potentially reducing alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social harms.</p>

          <p>Kash Patel, a former FBI Director and Trump loyalist, has won a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson, who was ordered to pay $250,000 in damages. Patel sued Stewartson over public accusations that he was a "Kremlin asset" and had planned the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued a default judgment after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court filings. The judge determined that Stewartson acted with malice, and the punitive damages were intended to deter similar defamatory conduct in the future.</p>

          <p>The discovery of a submerged 1960s-era Buick in the Mississippi River by two fishermen may have solved the 57-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. The fishermen spotted the vehicle using sonar technology, and authorities later recovered it with human remains inside. The car's vehicle identification number matched that of the 1963 Buick Electra that Benn was driving when he went missing in September 1967. While forensic confirmation is pending, authorities believe the remains belong to Benn, potentially bringing closure to a case that has remained unsolved for decades.</p>

          <p>An American archaeology student from Florida discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first excavation in the United Kingdom. Yara Souza, a student at Newcastle University, found the decorative artifact just 90 minutes into a dig in Northumberland, near the route of a major Roman road. The object is believed to have been high-status, used only by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes, and may have been deliberately buried alongside a similar piece found in the same area in 2021. The exciting find provides new insight into the lives of high-status individuals in early medieval England.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons company is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by fiber-optic cables, making them immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming. The company, Fold, is working to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant upgrade that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike high-value targets far behind enemy lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, such as added weight and potential snags, the ability to conduct unjammable precision strikes is a critical advantage. This innovation reflects the rapidly evolving nature of drone warfare on the Ukrainian battlefield.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are facing homelessness, a crisis that healthcare organizations are increasingly stepping in to address. Groups like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally aim to keep frail seniors in their homes but now find they must first secure housing for their clients. Rising housing costs and economic instability are pushing more people over 55 into homelessness for the first time. In response, some PACE programs and even hospitals are partnering with housing providers or developing their own properties to ensure their patients have a stable place to live.</p>
