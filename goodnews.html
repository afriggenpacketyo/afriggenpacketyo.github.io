          <p>Alphabet's Waymo has secured approval to extend its autonomous ride-hailing service to additional areas of the San Francisco Bay Area, including San Jose. The California Public Utilities Commission approved Waymo's passenger safety plan, enabling the expansion of its driverless coverage from San Francisco down through the Peninsula. Waymo expressed enthusiasm about bringing the benefits of Waymo One to more of the Bay Area in the future, though immediate changes to operations are not expected. This expansion marks a significant step in the continued development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to manage their fears in response to Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to past market reactions to similar downgrades. He argued that the downgrade triggered unwarranted fear, leading investors to sell solid portfolios. Cramer suggested gold and bitcoin as potential hedges against government borrowing, but cautioned against selling based on fear. He emphasized that investors should view the downgrade as an early warning to increase savings and investments, rather than a signal to exit the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to uncover why our Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan constructing advanced detectors to study neutrinos. The current understanding of the Universe's creation cannot fully explain the existence of planets, stars, and galaxies. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and the Japanese-led Hyper-K experiment aim to study neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts to determine why matter prevailed over antimatter after the Big Bang. Discoveries from these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of the Universe and humanity's place within it.</p>

Third, China aims to strengthen trade and investment ties with other countries, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative.

          <p>After former President Joe Biden's announcement of an "aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis, it's important to understand the disease. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, and early detection is crucial. Symptoms include urinary problems and blood in urine or semen, though many cases are asymptomatic. Screening involves PSA tests and digital rectal exams, and treatment options vary based on the cancer's stage, ranging from active surveillance to surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. Survival rates are high for localized cancer, but decrease when the cancer spreads.</p>
