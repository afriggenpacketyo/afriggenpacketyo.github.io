          <p>The UK government has proposed expanding the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, to cover a larger area of its offshore Marine Protected Areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal, which follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling, would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2, covering 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs. A 12-week consultation will seek input from the marine and fishing industry.</p>

This partnership cements Chinese companies as key players in Egypt‚Äôs infrastructure development and positions Cairo as a gateway for China's Belt and Road Initiative into Africa and the Middle East.
