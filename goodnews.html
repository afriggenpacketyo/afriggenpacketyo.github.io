          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company's new "NVLink Fusion" program at Computex 2025 in Taiwan, which allows customers and partners to use non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology. This marks a significant shift from the previously closed NVLink system, enabling the combination of Nvidia processors with CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for semi-custom AI infrastructure. Partners like MediaTek, Marvell, and Qualcomm Technologies will be able to connect their CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers, potentially capturing a larger share of the ASIC-based data center market. Ray Wang, a semiconductor analyst, noted that NVLink represents Nvidia's strategic plans to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, traditionally seen as Nvidia competitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated he prefers only one interest rate cut this year, balancing potential inflation pressures with recession worries. The Fed's March projections suggested two rate cuts in 2025, but Bostic noted that recent tariffs have exceeded expectations. He expressed concern about rising inflation expectations, which could complicate the Fed's dual mandate of supporting maximum employment and stable prices. Bostic emphasized the need to monitor how tariffs might impact prices, stating that troublesome movements in inflation expectations could make the Fed's job harder. It is important to note that Bostic is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy.</p>

This shift aims to help students prepare for evolving job demands and critically assess AI tools responsibly. The New York Times article highlights how teachers are using chatbots to simulate historical figures and provide feedback on student writing, emphasizing the importance of ethical and responsible AI use in education. Daniel Mateo, assistant superintendent of innovation, views AI as another tool in the educational arsenal, requiring careful vetting and guardrails.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at resetting relations after Brexit, focusing on security cooperation and trade. The New York Times article reports that the deal aims to help the two sides work more closely together amid signals that the United States is reducing its commitment to European security. Key aspects include easing border crossings for British citizens, facilitating pet travel, and allowing the sale of some British meat products in the EU again. However, politically contentious issues remain, such as fishing rights for European trawlers in British waters, with the agreement extending access until June 2038. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hopes that the tangible benefits for consumers and travelers will outweigh objections from Brexit supporters.</p>

          <p>China's central government has directed state institutions and ministries to increase purchases of domestic electric vehicles (EVs) to promote environmentally friendly automobiles for official use. While no specific target was mentioned, the directive signals the government's support for home-made EVs and aims to influence broader adoption. However, analysts suggest the impact on the overall market may be limited, as official procurement accounts for a relatively small share of national auto sales. The South China Morning Post article notes that Beijing has been promoting EV purchases by state institutions since 2017, with recent guidelines requiring EVs to constitute at least 30% of annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's relationship with Qatar has undergone a significant transformation, shifting from condemnation to acceptance, largely influenced by Qatar's role as a global mediator and a generous gift. During his first term, Trump criticized Qatar for allegedly funding terrorism and supported a blockade against the country. However, Qatar has now won Trump's favor, evidenced by a Qatari royal family's offer to donate a $400 million luxury jet for the president's use. This shift is also attributed to Qatar's mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, as well as its role in facilitating talks between the US and the Taliban. The Guardian article highlights that Qatar's ability to bring enemies together and its strategic importance to the US have contributed to Trump's changed perspective.</p>

          <p>An exploration of how cultural narratives and societal expectations have shaped the expression of male friendship throughout history, contrasting the passionate bonds celebrated in Renaissance Europe with the more reserved depictions in modern times. The Atlantic article draws on examples such as the memorial of Sir John Finch and Sir Thomas Baines, two 17th-century doctors whose friendship was publicly celebrated, to highlight how emotional communities influence the way individuals expect to feel and behave in friendship. The piece also examines the shift in the 18th and 19th centuries, when women's friendships became idealized while male bonds were increasingly portrayed as clumsy or superficial, reflecting changing social norms and anxieties around male intimacy. By understanding these historical shifts, we can reimagine the terms of friendship and foster more meaningful connections in the present.</p>

Poland's election saw liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski leading, but hard-right candidates secured significant support, setting up a potentially close runoff. The New York Times article highlights that while the political center held, the growing support for hard-right candidates signals a shift away from traditional party loyalties, indicating future political instability.

An agreement on fisheries allows EU fishermen access to British waters for an extended period in exchange for eased customs checks on food imports and exports.

The BBC article suggests that Starmer's approach involves making the post-Brexit relationship smoother without reopening the major questions of single market and customs union membership. While the Conservatives have criticized the deal as a "surrender," Starmer's success depends on the public's desire for as little friction with the EU as possible. If opposition parties campaign heavily against the deal, it will indicate that Brexit remains a significant and controversial issue.</p>
