          <p>Ming Li Hui, known as Carol, was released after being detained by immigration authorities, an event that shook her small Missouri town. Her detention brought the reality of President Trump's immigration crackdown to rural Missouri, where supporters rallied for her freedom. The New York Times article highlights the impact of immigration policies on individuals and communities. There is a sense of relief and community support in the wake of her release, although broader immigration concerns persist.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed light on how birds beat dinosaurs in conquering the sky. The study examines the evolution of flight feathers, a critical step in the evolution of birds, with insight into how feathers evolved during the Cretaceous period. Researchers were able to study feathers that are 99 million years old. While modern birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to certain bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, can significantly reduce the risk of lung infections in young children. The study found that infants with this bacteria were less likely to be hospitalized for lung infections within their first two years of life. Researchers believe these bacteria interact with the immune system, aiding in its development and ability to differentiate between harmful and beneficial microbes. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery, highlighting the importance of early microbial exposure.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in a Boulder, Colorado, attack. The judge cited the potential for irreparable harm if deportation occurred without due process. Soliman's family, Egyptian citizens, had entered the U.S. in 2022 and applied for asylum. The family's lawyers argued that punishing them for the crimes of a relative violates democratic justice principles. This ruling is one of several recent legal setbacks for the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara. The operation's onshore pipeline system suffered a major rupture in 2015. Sable Offshore Corp. has been working to reactivate the Santa Ynez Unit, but the ruling forces them to push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, arguing that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public input.</p>

The UK's drug safety experts caution that the impact of these medicines, like Wegovy and Mounjaro, on unborn babies is unknown. These prescription drugs are licensed to treat obesity by mimicking hormones that create a feeling of fullness. Concerns are growing that the increasing popularity of these "skinny jabs" means women are not using them safely or receiving appropriate medical advice, particularly when purchasing them from unregulated sources.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there, has been flown back to the US following a judge's order.

The Trump administration admitted to an error in falsely claiming that OCG was not afraid of being returned to Mexico. Another judge ruled that the administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a prison in El Salvador a chance to challenge their deportations.</p>
