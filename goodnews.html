          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers advanced to the National League Championship Series, securing their first postseason series win since 2018 by defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 in a decisive Game 5 of their NL Division Series. Key home runs from William Contreras, Andrew Vaughn, and Brice Turang powered the Brewers' offense, while a strong, collective pitching effort from five different relievers effectively shut down the Cubs' lineup. This victory not only propels Milwaukee into an NLCS showdown with the Los Angeles Dodgers but also delivers a particularly satisfying triumph against their biggest rival and former manager, Craig Counsell, ending years of playoff frustration for the team and its dedicated fanbase. The team's cohesive performance and strategic approach were instrumental in overcoming their recent playoff history.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are preparing for their NLCS clash against the Milwaukee Brewers, with manager Dave Roberts acknowledging several concerns about their upcoming opponent. Despite a significantly lower payroll, the Brewers have built a formidable team around a small-ball offense, excelling in getting on base, limiting strikeouts, and stealing bases, which led them to their winningest season. Their pitching staff, renowned for developing talent, ranked second in MLB team ERA, featuring ace Freddy Peralta and impactful rookie Jacob Misiorowski. The Dodgers, who were swept twice by Milwaukee earlier this year, face a challenging series against a team with impressive offensive depth and few exploitable pitching weak spots, requiring strategic adjustments to advance.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, former LA schools superintendent and philanthropist, is planning to challenge Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 election, criticizing her administration's response to rising crime, housing costs, and the devastating Palisades fire. Beutner, whose own home was seriously damaged, specifically cited a "failure of leadership" in the city's emergency response, including issues with hydrants and firefighter deployment. His entry into the race poses a significant political threat to Bass, potentially inspiring other high-profile candidates like Rick Caruso to join. This announcement follows a year of crises for Bass, including a $1-billion budget shortfall and federal immigration crackdowns, which have impacted her standing with voters.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's woeful performance at the plate during the Dodgers' NL Division Series, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, has raised significant concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series. Manager Dave Roberts attributed some of the struggles to Ohtani frequently facing left-handed pitchers, but also strongly emphasized the need for Ohtani's "recalibration" and improved "at-bat quality." Roberts explicitly stated that the team cannot win the World Series with that level of performance, urging Ohtani to better manage the hitting zone and adjust to opposing pitching strategies. Ohtani's ability to learn from this slump and make crucial adjustments will be a critical X-factor for the Dodgers' postseason success.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at a raucous Sheffield Arena. Despite a passionate 9,000-strong home crowd, the judges scored the fight 115-111, 117-109, and 116-10 in favor of Makhmudov, who boasted an imposing knockout record. Allen, 33, making his first headlining appearance at the venue after returning from a five-year retirement, showed toughness and landed significant blows in later rounds, even as Makhmudov demonstrated durability. Although Allen expressed determination to continue, stating "I'm not finished," this defeat marks another setback in his professional career, which he has rebuilt after previous challenges.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October 2025, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, a tradition for over a century, means most people will gain an extra hour, though night shift workers will face an extended shift. The change occurs at 02:00 BST on Sunday, October 26, 2025, and will bring sunset forward by an hour, a noticeable change for many. While debates continue about making BST permanent for potential economic productivity and reduced road accidents, concerns remain about the impact of very gloomy winter mornings, particularly for commuters and schoolchildren in Scotland.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her initial shock and subsequent understanding of her 86-year-old mother Patsy's decision to donate her body to medical science after death. Patsy, a bowel cancer survivor, is determined to give back to medical professionals and has already arranged her donation with Cardiff University. The article explores the process of body donation, highlighting how medical students learn from real bodies and develop a connection with their "silent teachers." While body donation offers invaluable educational benefits, it also means a long wait for families to hold a funeral, prompting the need for memorial services and adjustment during the grieving process.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Why Britain is Experiencing Widespread Respiratory Illnesses</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, with many people suffering from persistent coughs, colds, and sinus pressure, prompting questions about the cause. Experts attribute this to a "perfect breeding ground" created by children returning to school and adults to work, coupled with more time spent indoors as cooler weather arrives. Data from the UK Health Security Agency shows a rise in Rhinovirus (common cold) and circulating Covid variants, with early signs of flu also emerging in younger age groups. While current illness levels are not exceptionally high, the article emphasizes the importance of vaccinations for vulnerable groups and basic hygiene like handwashing and staying home when ill, to protect others and manage the seasonal spread.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of holidaymakers are turning to AI tools like ChatGPT for travel planning, using them to suggest destinations and craft itineraries. Alan Smith successfully used ChatGPT to discover a "perfect" seaside town in northern Spain, praising its efficiency over traditional search engines for finding travel information. However, the article also warns against over-reliance on AI, as Hannah Read discovered when ChatGPT incorrectly suggested a non-existent ferry route to Norway, causing disappointment. Experts advise users to understand AI's tendency to be overly encouraging and to always fact-check its recommendations, particularly for critical details like travel routes, opening times, and cost-saving options, to ensure a smooth and enjoyable holiday experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI's rapid and unprecedented dominance is reshaping the Silicon Valley startup landscape, posing unique challenges for entrepreneurs. Unlike previous tech giants, the privately held OpenAI operates with secretive financials and an unrivaled willingness to spend, investing across the AI stack from data centers to consumer apps and hardware. Its flagship ChatGPT chatbot has reached 800 million weekly users, and CEO Sam Altman is forging massive infrastructure deals and launching new products at a dizzying pace. This "gold rush mentality" is creating a fast-moving, opaque environment where traditional "technical moats" are less relevant, forcing startups to target niche or heavily regulated industries.
