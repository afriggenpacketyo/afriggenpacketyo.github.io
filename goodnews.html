          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are strengthening their alliance in artificial intelligence, driven by ambitions to dominate the global AI landscape. The UAE, rich in energy resources, seeks to become a regional AI hub, while the U.S. aims to ensure American companies lead the AI race against China. Recent deals, including the Stargate Project, involve significant investments from OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia, granting the UAE access to advanced American technology and software. This partnership marks a shift from traditional oil and weapons-focused relations to one centered on compute power and AI ecosystems, with the UAE strategically aligning with the U.S. in the U.S.-China competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's aeronautics industry has achieved a significant breakthrough with a patented next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines. This innovation allows alloy turbine blades to withstand temperatures 15% higher than existing versions, enhancing engine thrust, fuel efficiency, and service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials, under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), developed the technology. These high-temperature alloy turbine blades are crucial for modern jet engines, directly influencing performance and reliability, with the new method improving the thermal tolerance of the blades.</p>

          <p>A new Covid variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. after a surge in China, though it is not yet included in federal variant-tracking dashboards due to limited U.S. sequences. While LP.8.1 remains the dominant strain, NB.1.8.1 has led to increased hospitalizations in Asia. The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring, noting a rise in prevalence from late March to April. Current data suggests it may spread more easily but does not lead to more severe illness than other variants, and existing Covid vaccines are expected to remain effective against it.</p>

Cunha views United as a big club and is excited by the challenge of reviving its fortunes. The move would benefit all parties, with Cunha joining a bigger club and Wolves receiving over ¬£60 million to reinvest. United needs to boost its attacking options, and Cunha, with 27 goals in 65 Premier League appearances, is seen as someone who can make an instant impact.</p>

          <p>Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, has recorded a record number of puffins, with 43,626 counted this year, despite global populations declining rapidly. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators and human impact. While puffins face threats like pollution, food shortages, and climate change globally, Skomer Island provides an abundance of food and a lack of predators, contributing to high breeding success. Conservationists remain cautiously optimistic about the future of puffins on Skomer.</p>

The 18-point action plan calls for deepening AI integration and fostering new industry service providers by 2027. It aims to have over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes within two years and to cultivate at least 100 specialized service providers. By 2030, China intends to have a core industrial database to enable breakthroughs and scale the high end of the global value chain.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries. Under the system, companies will receive a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold, incentivizing emissions reduction. The government estimates that the targeted companies account for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
