          <p>Top officials from China and the United States are engaged in a second day of negotiations in London, aiming to de-escalate trade and technology tensions that have impacted the global economy. No official statements were released after the first round of talks, but both sides have signaled their expectations for the discussions. The U.S. is seeking the removal of Chinese export controls on rare earth minerals, while President Trump has authorized his delegation to negotiate away recent restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies to China. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism for a swift resolution and a "big, strong handshake."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, has announced plans to split into two separate companies by the middle of next year. The US media giant intends to separate its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks. This move comes as streaming services attract a growing number of users, while cable TV audiences decline. The streaming and studios business, which will include HBO Max and the film division, will be headed by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, encompassing CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence, seemingly rejecting President Trump's attempt to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery. The institution stated that its secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, has the support of the Board of Regents in his authority and management, implying that personnel decisions will be made by Bunch, not Trump. This announcement follows a Board of Regents meeting held to discuss the fate of the director, after Trump's social media post indicated he was firing the director for being a partisan supporter of DEI. The Smithsonian emphasized its nonpartisan nature and commitment to being a welcoming place of knowledge for all Americans, free from political influence.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by rejecting President Trump's attempt to fire National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet. The institution's statement emphasizes that the Board of Regents and Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch have the authority over personnel decisions, suggesting that Trump's order will not be followed. This decision comes after Trump's executive order demanding an end to federal funding for exhibitions based on racial themes and his attempts to reshape federal cultural institutions.

The Department for Education (DfE) advises transparency about AI use and checking its results, limiting its application to "low-stakes" marking.

          <p>Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP), a leading renewable energy dividend stock, is predicted to crush the S&P 500's returns over the next decade. The company sells about 90% of its renewable energy under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs), providing stable and steadily growing cash flow. With multiple drivers potentially powering over 10% annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share through 2034, the company's high-yielding dividend is well-supported by its financial profile. A combination of income and growth should result in market-crushing total returns, making it a compelling stock to buy and hold. (not investment advice)</p>
