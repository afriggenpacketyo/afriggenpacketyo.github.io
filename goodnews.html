          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, to bolster the economy amid trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and the reserve requirement ratio, injecting significant liquidity into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as consumption and elderly care. While analysts note these steps indicate urgency, some suggest their impact on domestic credit demand may be limited, and new fiscal policies might be needed to see concrete economic improvement.</p>

Families of victims have expressed support for the measure, viewing it as a step towards providing peace and justice.

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly-agreed trade deal with India that includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties claim this could disadvantage British workers by making Indian workers cheaper to employ. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts that he would never tolerate British workers being undercut as a result of a trade agreement. The deal extends the Nics exemption from one to three years, meaning individuals on short-term visas will only make social security payments in their home country when working abroad.</p>
