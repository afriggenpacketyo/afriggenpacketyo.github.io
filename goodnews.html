        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broader support, as votes are redistributed from eliminated candidates until one candidate reaches a majority. The process involves multiple rounds of tabulation, with the candidate receiving the fewest first-choice votes being eliminated in each round until a winner emerges. While this method aims to reduce wasted votes and prevent candidates with fringe views from winning, it can also be complex and less transparent than traditional elections.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, showcasing its ability to deeply explore the universe. The images reveal colorful gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years away, highlighting the telescope's capacity to transform our understanding of the cosmos. This observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, will conduct a 10-year survey of the southern night sky, mapping the Milky Way, detecting killer asteroids, and answering crucial questions about dark matter. The telescope's design ensures high image quality by using a unique three-mirror system and maintaining strict darkness within the observatory to capture faint astronomical light.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has released its first images, marking the beginning of a decade-long survey to create a time-lapse video of the night sky. The observatory, equipped with a large telescope and a massive digital camera, will gather data on approximately 40 billion celestial objects. By repeatedly imaging the same areas, the observatory will detect changes and movements in the sky, alerting researchers to transient phenomena like exploding stars and asteroids. The data collected is expected to revolutionize astronomy by allowing scientists to mine vast amounts of information and study the universe in unprecedented detail.</p>

          <p>China's use of pandas as diplomatic tools is gaining attention as Japan faces its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. Experts suggest China may loan new pandas to Japan to improve relations amid tensions with the United States. Panda loans often coincide with high-level bilateral talks, symbolizing friendship and providing economic benefits through tourism. However, some analysts are skeptical that panda diplomacy will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic policy or public opinion towards China, noting that the Japanese public no longer views pandas through a political lens.</p>
