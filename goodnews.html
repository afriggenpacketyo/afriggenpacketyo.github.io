Speaking at a conference, he emphasized that as companies grow, they can accumulate unnecessary processes that stifle agility. Jassy has implemented measures such as flattening management structures and creating an email alias for employees to report excessive rules. This cultural overhaul is part of a broader strategy to increase efficiency and competitiveness following a period of significant cost-cutting and layoffs.</p>

Although the train remained upright and no injuries were reported, the incident halted service on portions of the A and E light rail lines. Metro authorities worked to remove the disabled train and arranged for shuttle buses to transport passengers around the affected area. The cause of the derailment is under investigation.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old woman in Chino Hills, California, used her recently purchased cup of tea to fend off an armed attacker. The assailant reportedly brandished a knife and demanded that she hand over her beverage. By throwing the drink at him, the woman created an opportunity to escape unharmed and contact the authorities. A 29-year-old suspect was arrested shortly thereafter and booked on a charge of robbery in connection with the unusual incident.</p>

          <p>This article offers a retrospective on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, celebrating his consistent choice to tackle complex, often flawed characters instead of relying on his conventional good looks for simple heroic roles. It highlights how films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men" utilized his all-American image to explore deeper critiques of idealism, success, and corruption. The piece concludes that Redford's enduring legacy is built on his willingness to challenge audiences and sidestep the easy path of a traditional movie star.</p>

          <p>After a legal battle spanning two decades, five partially constructed and dilapidated homes in Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon are set to be demolished. The L.A. City Attorney's office announced a plea agreement with the property's current developers, who pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders. Construction on the homes was halted in 2002, and the structures have since become a safety hazard and a point of frustration for the community. The demolition is required to be completed by August 2026.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned to become the next non-tech company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. He attributed this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the strong leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer also observed a positive trend for the entire banking sector, noting that Wall Street appears increasingly willing to assign higher price-to-earnings multiples to financial institutions, signaling growing confidence in their stability and profitability.

          <p>New data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency shows a dramatic shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being taken in automatic cars. This trend is strongly linked to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), which do not use manual gearboxes. With the UK's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars set for 2030, driving instructors say more learners are opting for automatics, which can be simpler to learn and are seen as the future of driving.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 0.25 percentage point cut to its key interest rate, marking the first reduction since last December. The move is seen as a response to recent signs of a weakening labor market, with policymakers aiming to provide a boost to the economy. This decision comes after sustained public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for much deeper cuts. The rate reduction signals a significant shift in the central bank's policy stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported in parts of Washington state due to strong winds lifting old volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

Officials have assured the public that the volcano's alert level remains "Normal," but they have cautioned that the airborne ash can pose a hazard to aircraft.</p>
