          <p>David Ellison's recently merged Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would create a massive media and entertainment conglomerate. The potential deal would combine Paramount's franchises like 'Star Trek' and 'Mission: Impossible' with Warner Bros. Discovery's extensive library, which includes DC superheroes, 'Harry Potter,' and 'Game of Thrones.' Such an acquisition would also consolidate significant sports media rights, creating a powerful competitor to other industry giants like Disney.</p>

          <p>An unusual incident occurred during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship, where English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick's ball was reportedly stolen by spectators after an errant tee shot. The theft happened just before play was suspended for weather, and under the rules, he was allowed a penalty drop when play resumed. Fitzpatrick stated that this outcome was a 'good result,' as it was likely more advantageous than having to play his provisional ball, potentially saving him at least one stroke in his round.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Most Federal Tax Breaks Are Ineffective and Costly</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article presents the argument that many popular federal tax breaks, such as the mortgage-interest deduction and various education credits, are economically inefficient and fail to achieve their intended policy goals. Citing a new study on the cost-effectiveness of these provisions, the author contends that such 'tax expenditures' often distort economic decisions and primarily benefit specific industries or wealthier households. The piece concludes by advocating for the elimination of ineffective breaks in favor of a simpler, more neutral tax code or broad-based rate reductions.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have dropped to their lowest level in nearly a year, with the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage now standing at 6.35%. This decline is largely attributed to market expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon cut its benchmark interest rate, along with a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article examines the potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers and existing homeowners considering a refinance, weighing the benefits of acting now against the possibility of rates falling even further.

          <p>As part of a new tariff agreement, the U.S. and Japan have established a framework for a $550 billion investment fund, financed by Tokyo, for projects within the United States. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained that profits generated from these projects will be split equally between the two nations until Japan's initial $550 billion investment is fully recouped. Following that, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift heavily in favor of the U.S., which will receive 90% of future profits.</p>

          <p>A discussion is gaining momentum in Germany regarding the country's school curriculum, with calls to reform the traditional literary canon. Critics argue that the required reading lists are dominated by classic works from male authors like Goethe and lack representation from women and writers with immigrant backgrounds. Proponents of change believe the curriculum should better reflect Germany's diverse modern society and be more relevant to students' lives, while others defend the educational value of engaging with historical texts.</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal in California to ban PFAS, also known as 'forever chemicals,' from cookware has created a public debate pitting environmental advocates against celebrity chefs. Supporters of the bill, including actor Mark Ruffalo, argue the ban is necessary to protect public health from chemicals like PTFE (Teflon), which can be released from nonstick pans. Conversely, a group of prominent chefs, backed by the cookware industry, contends that these products are safe when used correctly and that a ban would negatively impact home cooking.</p>
