          <p>Savannah Chrisley shared her emotional reaction to the news that her parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, were pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. In an Instagram video, she recounted receiving a personal call from the president informing her of the pardon, expressing immense gratitude and disbelief. Chrisley emphasized that this pardon grants her parents a fresh start, highlighting that it was a full and unconditional pardon. The Chrisleys, known for their reality show "Chrisley Knows Best," were sentenced in November 2022 and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution, stemming from charges dating back to 2007. The call from Trump was unexpected and filled her with renewed hope after feeling discouraged. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome for the Chrisley family after a difficult legal battle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard suggests that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is a stronger predictor of financial well-being than high income or asset levels. The study, which surveyed over 12,000 Vanguard investors, found that individuals with emergency savings experience less financial stress and spend less time worrying about their finances each week. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasizes that the initial $2,000 provides confidence in handling unexpected expenses, which have a median cost of around $2,000. While saving this amount may be challenging for some, starting small and automating savings can help build an emergency fund over time (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted on Sunday night, shooting lava fountains over 1,000 feet into the air during a six-hour event, marking the 23rd episode in a series of eruptions since December 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) reported that the eruption produced large lava flows, covering approximately half of the Halema'uma'u crater floor, with the volcanic plume reaching heights of more than 14,000 feet. While the eruption poses no immediate danger to nearby communities, officials warn of potential hazards such as sulfur dioxide emissions creating volcanic smog, strands of volcanic glass called "Pele's hair," and high levels of volcanic gases. Scientists at HVO anticipate another eruption soon, following a pattern of weekly eruptions with magma buildup in between.</p>

          <h2>Vox Article Debunks Myths About Protein Intake for Muscle Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 06:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Vox article challenges the notion that excessive protein consumption is necessary for building muscle, arguing that many online fitness influencers promote unrealistic protein intake recommendations. The author, a deputy editor for Vox's Future Perfect, shares personal experiences of building muscle without tracking protein intake, consuming protein powder, or eating animal protein. Experts like Stuart Phillips, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University, dismiss the idea that one gram of protein per pound of body weight is a golden rule. The article suggests that aiming for 0.54 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight is sufficient for weightlifters, while also emphasizing the importance of plant-based protein sources and cautioning against over-reliance on animal products.</p>

          <p>A Vox advice column addresses the question of how to encourage wealthy family and friends to donate more to charity without being accusatory or making them defensive. The advice emphasizes understanding others' perspectives, avoiding moral judgment, and highlighting the personal satisfaction derived from giving. Drawing on Carl Rogers's psychology, the column suggests fostering unconditional positive regard and empathy to create an environment where loved ones feel safer and more understood. The piece also references Benoit Monin's research on "do-gooder derogation," cautioning against appearing morally superior. Ultimately, the column advocates for leading by example, emphasizing joy, and creating rituals that encourage reflection and gratitude.</p>

This approach marks a shift from recent USMNT roster-building strategies that heavily favored European-based players. Pochettino's decision reflects a desire to find players who know how to win and will do anything to achieve a result, regardless of their fame or club affiliation.
