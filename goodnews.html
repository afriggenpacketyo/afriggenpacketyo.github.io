          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers to businessman Mark Walter, valuing the team at $10 billion, which would set a new record for NBA valuations. Jeanie Buss will retain a minority stake and her position as governor. Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, WNBA's Sparks, and Cadillac's forthcoming Formula 1 team. Former Lakers legend Magic Johnson praised the deal, noting Walter's suitability to continue the Lakers' legacy of winning. The Lakers finished the 2025 season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and have won 11 NBA titles since the Buss family took over. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach while assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, as initially forecasted in March. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but acknowledged uncertainty due to the Trump administration's tariffs. The Fed expects inflation to rise to 3% by year-end and unemployment to increase to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JJ Spaun joked that he owes Viktor Hovland a "nice bottle of wine" for helping him on his U.S. Open-winning putt. Paired together in the final round, Spaun and Hovland's approach shots landed close to each other on the 18th hole. Hovland narrowly missed his putt, and Spaun, with an identical line, drained it from 64 feet to win his first major. Spaun shot 66-72-69-72 to finish as the only player under par at Oakmont, overcoming five bogeys in his first six holes on Sunday and a weather delay to secure the victory.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold made his debut for Real Madrid following his departure from Anfield, adopting his first name on his shirt and speaking Spanish at his unveiling. He had a shaky start, being caught out of position on several occasions, but improved as the game progressed. Alexander-Arnold contributed to Madrid's goal by intercepting a pass and passing to Gonzalo Garcia. By the time he was substituted, he had played more crosses, entered the final third more times, and had more passes in the final third than any of his teammates.</p>

          <p>Eugene Brown, known for his pranks, won $5 million in the lottery, but his wife initially thought it was a joke and asked him to take out the garbage. Brown bought the winning ticket while out with their toddler, and after scratching it, he showed it to his wife, who told him it was $5 million. After convincing her it was real, Brown told lottery officials he planned to pay off his house and put the rest into a trust. Winning a big prize in the lottery is extremely rare, but Southern California has had several jackpot winners recently.</p>
