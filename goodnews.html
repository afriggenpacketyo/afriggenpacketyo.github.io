          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper in a shocking twist during the series finale of Doctor Who. Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler, will be the second woman to portray the Doctor, following Jodie Whittaker. Gatwa's tenure lasted only 18 months, making it the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005. Piper had previously expressed doubts about playing the Doctor herself, despite advocating for a female lead after Peter Capaldi's exit, but the BBC has confirmed that she is indeed the new Doctor and will be taking on the role moving forward.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Mookie Betts sustained a fractured toe after reportedly banging it into a wall while walking to the bathroom in the dark, sidelining him for games against the Yankees. Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to recover quickly and avoid the injured list, though putting on a shoe was difficult for him. This injury adds to a series of unusual incidents for the Dodgers, as Freddie Freeman missed games earlier this season after slipping in the shower. Betts is currently having a down year compared to his career averages, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs. </p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to warn the public to avoid the area. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort to re-hive the bees and locate their queen, with the road closed for about 24 hours during the operation. Officials initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees, but later corrected the figure with assistance from a beekeeper on the scene. By morning, most of the bees were expected to return to their hives, and the road was reopened. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the overuse and ineffectiveness of corporate buzzwords, arguing that they impede trust and create confusion. While intended to foster inclusion and team spirit, jargon often alienates employees, especially Gen Zers who may cling to buzzwords due to workplace insecurity. The author suggests that buzzwords are used to distract from the primary goal of making money, advocating for clear, human language instead. By speaking plainly and embracing genuine communication, individuals can foster better understanding and connection in the workplace. </p>
