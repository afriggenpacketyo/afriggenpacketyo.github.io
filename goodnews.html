          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has been issued a significant fine of almost £31,500 ($42,500) for unsportsmanlike behavior during his first-round exit from the tournament. The incident involved a meltdown triggered by a photographer on court during his match against Benjamin Bonzi, leading to a $30,000 penalty. Additionally, he received a $12,500 fine for smashing his racket. This penalty means Medvedev will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money, a consequence he had anticipated.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, is a bruising crime caper set in a gritty 1998 New York City. The article follows Hank Thompson (Austin Butler), a former baseball player whose life spirals into a criminal underworld after a series of unfortunate events involving a cat. Hank navigates a dangerous landscape populated by various toughs, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, while being pursued by NYPD Detective Roman (Regina King). The film is praised for its intimate, grimy portrayal of the city and its exploration of squandered potential, with Butler delivering a compelling performance as a self-loathing alcoholic trying to survive.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are expressing strong optimism, with one software engineer reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating further gains. This sentiment is fueled by a government pledge to stabilize the stock market amid a shaky economy, aiming to create a "wealth effect" to spur consumption. The article highlights that investors are concentrating on high-beta stocks in new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors, which tend to perform well during market recoveries. This suggests a belief in continued market liquidity and government support to drive further growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The estimated cash value for the current jackpot is $428.9 million, before taxes. This prize would rank as Powerball's sixth-largest ever, behind the $1.08 billion won in July 2023. Ticket sales have doubled in the past week, with drawings held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, offering a choice between a lump sum or annual payments for winners.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors reacted to the Bank of Korea's decision to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, in line with economist expectations.

Australian markets were flat, though Lynas Rare Earths announced a significant share sale, and Qantas shares hit a record high after strong earnings. Hong Kong and mainland China indices declined, and India's Nifty 50 fell due to new U.S. tariffs. Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings also kept Asian chip stocks in focus.

          <p>The Bank of Korea maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, aligning with economist expectations, to further assess housing prices and household debt.

The article details the BOK's upgraded inflation forecast for 2025 to 2% and GDP growth to 0.9%. It also highlights the context of recent agreements with the U.S., including South Korean investment pledges and tariff reductions, which are expected to support domestic demand despite potential export slowdowns from U.S. tariffs.

          <p>Family, friends, and officials are commemorating the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death by reenacting his fateful 1955 train journey from Chicago to Mississippi. The ride, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, includes Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, 14, was brutally lynched after allegedly whistling at a white woman. His mother's decision for an open-casket funeral in Chicago, displaying his mutilated body, is widely credited with sparking the modern Civil Rights Movement. The commemoration serves as a powerful reminder of past injustices and the progress made, while acknowledging continued healing is needed.</p>

          <p>Florida is deploying robot rabbits as the latest tool in its battle against invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades. These solar-powered robotic lures mimic marsh rabbits by emitting heat, smell, and natural movements, designed to attract pythons to monitored pens. The initiative aims to improve detection, as the snakes are highly camouflaged and have decimated 95% of small mammals in Everglades National Park. Each robot costs about $4,000, and initial results are promising, contributing to ongoing efforts that have removed over 23,000 pythons since 2000.</p>

          <p>USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their historic football rivalry, which was facing potential termination after 100 years. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a deal soon, acknowledging the importance of the series to fans and the program. The previous reluctance from USC stemmed from College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC seeks to move it to September to balance its conference schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the long-standing tradition.</p>

Despite this, the article highlights strong demand for Nvidia's AI chips, accelerating production of new generations like the GB300 and upcoming Rubin chips, and an optimistic long-term outlook for AI infrastructure spending.
