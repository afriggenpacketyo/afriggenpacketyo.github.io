          <h2>New Federal Tax Deduction for Auto Loan Interest Introduced</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:47:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will offer a new tax deduction for car buyers, allowing them to deduct up to $10,000 in qualified passenger vehicle loan interest starting in 2025. This significant benefit, which can be claimed even without itemizing, applies to new, U.S.-assembled light vehicles purchased for personal use, though it includes income limitations for full eligibility. While aiming to make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions, the act concurrently eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after September 30, altering the landscape of vehicle incentives. Experts estimate approximately 3.5 million new vehicle loans could qualify for this tax break, potentially saving typical car buyers hundreds of dollars annually (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Newcastle United Pursues Record Transfer Deal for Striker Hugo Ekitike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:35:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly exploring a potential record-breaking deal to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, with sources indicating a price tag likely exceeding £70 million. The 23-year-old French international had an impressive last season, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists in the Bundesliga, which helped his side secure a third-place finish. Despite this significant interest in Ekitike, club sources have clarified that Newcastle has no intention of selling its current top scorer, Alexander Isak, who has been linked with other major European clubs including Liverpool. Ekitike only joined Frankfurt last summer after an initial loan spell from Paris St-Germain, and remains under contract for another four years with the German club.</p>

          <p>The US men’s national soccer team will host friendlies against Ecuador and Australia in the October FIFA international window, providing crucial preparation ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The team will first face Ecuador on October 10 at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas, marking their 16th all-time meeting against a South American side that is currently second in Conmebol qualifying. Four days later, they will play Australia at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado. Both Ecuador and Australia have already secured their spots in the 2026 World Cup, offering the US a chance to test their squad against strong opposition. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino is expected to use these matches to integrate key players who missed the recent Gold Cup with emerging talents.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Cognition announced its acquisition of Windsurf's intellectual property, product, trademark, brand, and talent, just days after Google poached Windsurf's co-founder and CEO Varun Mohan in a reported $2.4 billion licensing deal. This acquisition is the latest development in an intense AI talent war among tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, who are fiercely competing for top engineers and researchers. Cognition, best known for its AI coding agent named Devin, aims to unite the teams and leverage Windsurf's assets to build software faster. Both companies are notably backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Windsurf's interim CEO expressed optimism about the future, emphasizing that all employees will be financially compensated in the transaction.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks closed slightly higher on Monday, largely shrugging off President Donald Trump's weekend announcement of new tariffs targeting the European Union and Mexico, which are set to take effect on August 1. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw modest gains, indicating that investors were not significantly deterred by the renewed trade tensions that threaten to raise consumer prices. Trump justified the tariffs by citing Mexico's alleged failure to curb fentanyl transport and the EU's unacceptably high trade deficit with the U.S. Mexican and European officials have expressed disagreement with the new levies, which are part of a broader set of duties affecting numerous countries and rekindling global trade disputes.</p>

However, he emphasized Cook's impressive track record of generating "thousands and thousands of percentages" in profits for the company and investors, affirming Apple's stock as a core holding in his Investing Club portfolio.

          <p>Los Angeles County has reported a 4% overall decrease in homelessness and a significant nearly 10% drop in people living on the streets in 2025, marking the second consecutive annual decline after years of increases. Officials attribute this progress to increased taxpayer investment and focused efforts like Mayor Bass's "Inside Safe" initiative, which prioritizes quickly moving individuals from encampments into interim and sometimes permanent housing. While the unsheltered population saw meaningful declines, the number of sheltered homeless individuals without a permanent home grew. Despite these positive trends, concerns remain about the pace of decline and the sustainability of funding, especially with potential federal cuts to rental subsidies like Section 8.</p>
