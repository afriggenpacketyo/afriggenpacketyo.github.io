        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility among the marsupials. Developed over a decade by UniSC researchers, the vaccine has shown promise in reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and even reversing existing symptoms. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and current antibiotic treatments are often ineffective or have side effects. This approval marks a significant step in conservation efforts for the endangered species.</p>

          <p>Fitness experts are highlighting "Zone Zero" workouts, a low-intensity activity where heart rate stays below 50% of maximum, encompassing gentle movements like walking or stretching. While not an official medical category, this approach promotes active rest, blood sugar regulation, improved circulation, and stress reduction. It serves as a foundation for daily movement, encouraging those not ready for intense exercise to remain active. However, experts note it alone won't build significant strength or endurance.</p>

          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's recurring problems are due to player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 formation. He observes improvements in team compactness but highlights individual mistakes leading to conceded goals. Murphy points to Bruno Fernandes playing out of his natural attacking role, lacking defensive instincts, and Luke Shaw being shoe-horned into a center-back position. The article suggests that manager Ruben Amorim must address these personnel issues for the team to achieve better results.</p>
