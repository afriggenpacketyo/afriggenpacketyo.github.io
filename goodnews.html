          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded defeat to Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing Democrat and state assemblyman, in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset for the former governor who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. In his concession speech, Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's victory and indicated he would consider his next steps. The primary is seen as a crucial indicator for the Democratic Party as it navigates its messaging following recent election losses. Mamdani's win was unexpected given that counting was expected to continue due to the ranked-choice system, making Cuomo's concession even more surprising. The win is considered a massive victory for Mamdani, signaling that New York Democrats are looking for leaders who are enthusiastic and courageous in the face of President Trump.</p>

          <p>A controversial Republican proposal, spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee, to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from the tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. The proposal aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address housing needs, but opponents doubted this outcome. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule, which prevents including extraneous, non-budgetary provisions in a reconciliation bill. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, though Lee indicated he would continue to pursue the plan with revisions.</p>

Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against Trump‚Äôs Department of Transportation was likely to succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program, but the Government Accountability Office found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.

          <p>A study by Chinese astronomers reveals that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, providing insights into how new stars are born. By analyzing thousands of stars using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it more challenging for massive stars to form. The study offers direct evidence that the Milky Way‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding party venue in Venice was moved from the city center to a more isolated location due to protests. Residents and pressure groups rallied against the event, arguing it would transform the city into a private amusement park for the wealthy. The party, expected to cost between ‚Ç¨40 to ‚Ç¨48 million, will now be held in the Arsenale, a safer venue surrounded by water. Bezos is reportedly making charitable donations, including ‚Ç¨1 million for lagoon ecosystem research.</p>
