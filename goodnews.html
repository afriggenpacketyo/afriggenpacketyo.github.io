          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a significant agreement covering fishing rights, defense cooperation, and trade, marking a reset in relations five years after Brexit. The deal aims to improve trade for food imports and exports, allowing European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, while also focusing on security and defense, and a youth mobility plan. The agreement comes amid a changing global landscape, with the return of President Trump creating a greater sense of urgency for cooperation between the U.K. and the bloc, though the deal faces criticism from Brexit supporters who view it as a surrender of sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicates he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year due to concerns about rising inflation, particularly related to the impact of tariffs. Despite the Federal Reserve's earlier projections of two rate cuts in 2025, Bostic worries about consumer sentiment and expectations moving in a troublesome way, potentially complicating the Fed's job. He emphasized that even reduced tariffs are economically significant, suggesting a cautious approach to monetary policy in the face of potential upward pressures on prices.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the "NVLink Fusion" program, allowing customers to use non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology. This move expands NVLink beyond Nvidia-made chips, enabling semi-custom AI infrastructure by combining Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). AI chipmaking partners for NVLink Fusion include MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence. This initiative positions Nvidia to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, traditionally seen as competitors, and maintain its central role in artificial intelligence development and computing.</p>

While no specific target was mentioned, the move signals the government‚Äôs support for home-made EVs, though its overall impact on the industry may be limited. This directive builds on previous guidelines from 2017 and a recent mandate that EVs must account for at least 30% of total annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities, reflecting ongoing efforts to cut costs and support domestic industries.</p>

This shift reflects Qatar's success in positioning itself as a global mediator, particularly in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and its strategic importance to the U.S. as a major supplier of liquified natural gas. While some criticize Qatar's ties with Islamist groups, Trump's administration values its role in resolving regional conflicts, aligning with Trump's transactional approach to diplomacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A look into the history of male friendship reveals how cultural narratives and societal expectations have shaped emotional bonds over time. In the Renaissance era, passionate bonds between men were celebrated, with figures like Sir John Finch and Sir Thomas Baines memorializing their intimate connection. However, views shifted in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to the idealization of female friendships and the portrayal of male bonds as less emotionally deep. Understanding these historical shifts can help reimagine contemporary expectations and foster more diverse and meaningful connections.</p>
