          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley is set to introduce legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning with some liberal Democrats. The bill, called the "Higher Wages for American Workers Act," would raise the minimum wage starting in 2026 and adjust for inflation in subsequent years; Democratic Senator Peter Welch is co-sponsoring the legislation. Hawley's move challenges traditional conservative opposition to minimum wage increases, reflecting a shift toward populism within the Republican Party. The federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009. </p>

          <p>Scientists have successfully helped Yosemite's native turtles recover by removing invasive bullfrogs from their habitat. The American bullfrog, an invasive species, preys on native wildlife, including pond turtle hatchlings. By eradicating bullfrogs from remote bodies of water in Yosemite National Park, researchers observed a striking recovery of the Northwestern pond turtle population. This study demonstrates a potential strategy for reversing the decline of certain species and restoring freshwater ecosystems through targeted invasive species removal. </p>
