          <p>The closure of a US duty-free loophole for low-value packages has increased prices for American consumers of online retailers like Shein and Temu.  This loophole, applying to parcels under $800, was closed to protect American businesses and combat illegal imports, including drugs.  The change led to price adjustments by Shein and Temu, highlighting the significant impact of the policy shift on both businesses and consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration eliminated a tariff loophole that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the US duty-free. This decision, while benefiting US manufacturers, has already led to higher prices for online shoppers. The loophole, known as the de minimis rule, allowed products under $800 to avoid tariffs.  The administration cited concerns about fentanyl smuggling and job losses in US warehousing and logistics as reasons for the change. Critics argue that the move will disproportionately harm consumers and small businesses.</p>
