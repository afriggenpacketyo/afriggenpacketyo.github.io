          <p>A summit in Washington involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump, and several European leaders marked a potential turning point in the approach to the war in Ukraine. The meeting focused on establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, which President Trump endorsed, describing them as similar to NATO's mutual defense clause without formal membership. Following the talks, Trump proposed a trilateral summit with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a new diplomatic path. European leaders expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing unity and Ukraine's sovereignty while remaining wary of Russia's intentions.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly pouring money into Europe's top soccer clubs, driven by soaring revenues and valuations that have grown exponentially over the past few decades. The Premier League and other major European leagues have seen revenue balloon, making teams attractive assets for American owners and private equity firms. This trend has popularized the multi-club ownership model, which offers marketing and financial benefits but is drawing scrutiny from regulators like UEFA. As broadcast revenue growth slows, new strategies, such as stadium enhancements and playing regular season games overseas, are being explored to sustain financial expansion.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to natural solutions like wetlands to combat the increasing threats of both flooding and drought. Due to climate change and urban sprawl, aging sewer systems are often overwhelmed by intense rainfall, while dry periods are becoming more severe. The regional "Sigma Plan" involves giving rivers more space through "depoldering," creating controlled flood zones and nature reserves that absorb excess water and release it slowly. While initially met with resistance, these projects have proven effective and now serve as international models for climate adaptation and community engagement.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume operations after its flight attendants' union, CUPE, announced a tentative agreement, bringing an end to a days-old strike that disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The walkout, which began over the weekend, centered on demands for better pay and compensation for ground duties, for which attendants were not previously paid. The strike had been declared illegal by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, but the union initially defied the order. The resolution followed renewed negotiations with a mediator, averting further travel chaos during the peak summer season.</p>

The move aims to fill gaps in the retailer's assortment, offering items like accessories for older electronics and complementary non-tech products such as furniture and cookware. The marketplace strategy, also adopted by other major retailers, is intended to drive new revenue streams and support the company's growing advertising business amid a challenging consumer electronics market.

          <p>A Los Angeles couple, Lexie Glass and Evan Hursley, converted their traditional grass lawn into a thriving, low-water landscape using a rebate from the city's turf replacement program. With a $5,100 rebate covering their material costs, they undertook a DIY project to create a garden filled with California native plants that now attracts hummingbirds, butterflies, and bees. By sheet mulching, installing drip irrigation, and selecting a diverse plant palette, they designed an outdoor space that serves as both a wildlife habitat and an extension of their home. Their project exemplifies a growing trend towards sustainable, climate-appropriate landscaping in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Cinematographer Jacques Jouffret explains his visual approach to the Netflix series "American Primeval," which follows a mother and son traversing the untamed Utah frontier in 1857. To reflect the characters' harsh and sparse environment, Jouffret utilized a straightforward, often handheld camera style to foster a direct connection between the audience and the characters. He aimed to find beauty within the raw reality of the scenes rather than creating conventionally beautiful shots. The frequent use of Dutch angles reinforces the story's themes of instability and violence, reflecting the shaky ground on which the American frontier was settled.</p>

          <p>A landmark 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away to protect it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The massive 672-tonne structure has been lifted onto giant trailers for a slow, two-day journey to the new city center. This relocation is the most symbolic part of a broader project to move the town, which is at risk from ground fissures created by the mine. The complex and historic event has drawn large crowds to witness the church, with its valuable altar painting and organ still inside, inch towards its new home.</p>

          <p>Cardiotonic steroids, potent toxins produced by animals like the cane toad, can induce a fatal heart attack in predators, serving as a powerful defense mechanism. However, evolutionary biologist Shabnam Mohammadi's research reveals that some predators have developed adaptations to safely consume these toxins. Interestingly, these same compounds have been utilized in human medicine since ancient Egypt. Today, specific versions of these toxic steroids are prescribed by doctors to treat congestive heart failure, showcasing a fascinating intersection of evolutionary biology and modern pharmacology where a poison can also be a life-saving treatment.</p>

The camp provides an intensive, three-week on-campus experience where students learn the principles behind AI and work on real-world applications.
