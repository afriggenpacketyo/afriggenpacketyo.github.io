        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially withdrawn its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of a significant crypto enforcement action. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and unlawfully enabling trading in unregistered securities. This dismissal comes as the Trump administration aims to demonstrate its support for the crypto industry, following the Justice Department's shutdown of its crypto enforcement team and the likely appointment of a venture capitalist with crypto ties to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Binance is also increasing its ties with World Liberty Financial, a project linked to the Trump family, and expanding its operations in Pakistan. Optimism regarding the future of Binance is rising as a result of these developments. </p>

          <p>Costco's shares experienced a slight dip despite the company surpassing earnings and revenue estimates for the fiscal third quarter, with an 8% increase in sales year-over-year. While Costco does not provide an annual outlook, company leaders discussed the challenges and increased costs associated with tariffs during an earnings call. The company is actively seeking methods to mitigate tariff costs while maintaining low prices, including expediting orders to the U.S. before tariffs take effect and sourcing more private-label items domestically. Despite these efforts, Costco has absorbed some tariff-related cost differences while increasing prices for certain discretionary items, like flowers. Despite the challenges, Costco's limited approach to the variety of items they sell helps them to negotiate prices with suppliers more closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler attended a special screening of his film "Sinners" in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the town where the movie is set, following a community petition. The film, starring Michael B. Jordan, is a supernatural vampire flick set in 1930s Mississippi that blends drama, action, and music. Coogler expressed that working on the script and visiting Mississippi had a profound impact on him. The event was significant because Clarksdale lacks a movie theater, making it difficult for residents to see a film about their own hometown. The crowd's enthusiastic response to the screening underscores the film's connection to the community. </p>

          <p>Gap shares plummeted after the retailer announced that new tariffs could cost the company between $100 million and $150 million if they remain in effect. The company is working to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and reducing its exposure to China, with plans to source more cotton from the U.S. Despite the tariff challenges, Gap reported fiscal first-quarter results that exceeded expectations for both earnings and revenue. CEO Richard Dickson emphasized that the company does not anticipate meaningful price increases for consumers.
