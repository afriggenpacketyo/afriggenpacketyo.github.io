          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that held former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. liable for damages related to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that the executives could not have foreseen the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 decision which ordered them to pay approximately 13 trillion yen in compensation. Separately, the Japanese government approved a 20 trillion yen plan to enhance disaster resilience across the country's infrastructure over the next five years, focusing on measures to address aging infrastructure. These measures are aimed at improving the country's readiness for future disasters.</p>

          <p>Russia's central bank has reduced its interest rates to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling a decrease in inflation pressures. The rates had been held at 21% since last October, the highest level since the new benchmark rate was introduced in 2013. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank indicated that monetary policy would remain tight for an extended period to achieve its 4% inflation target (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Roads, railways, and bridges are increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat, leading to failures and disruptions in transportation. Rising temperatures cause asphalt to melt, rail tracks to buckle, and bridge joints to expand, necessitating adaptation strategies. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, lighter-colored pavements, and the use of more heat-resistant materials in railway construction. Bridges are being redesigned with better expansion joints and stronger bearings to withstand temperature fluctuations, ensuring the longevity and safety of critical infrastructure.</p>

The prior day saw a significant drop in Tesla's stock value, attributed to the ongoing conflict between the two figures. Analysts cited a report indicating that Trump had scheduled a call with Musk to potentially mediate a resolution. The relationship between Musk and Trump has been strained recently, particularly after Musk's term as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency concluded.</p>

          <p>The New York Times has launched a new podcast series titled "The Protocol," which delves into the controversial debate surrounding healthcare for transgender youth. The series examines the origins of youth gender medicine, its intended purpose, and the ongoing legal and political battles over its future. This exploration comes as nearly half of the states in the U.S. have passed bans on medical treatments for transgender minors, with the Trump administration also targeting this care. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the matter in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases by selling them through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong. This move could support Hong Kong's efforts to become a virtual asset hub. The municipal Public Security Bureau in Beijing has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to offload seized cryptoassets through regulated platforms in Hong Kong. Proceeds from the sales will be converted into yuan and deposited in designated accounts.</p>
