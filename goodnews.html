        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four lawsuits have been filed in Kansas against pornographic websites for allegedly violating state law by failing to implement adequate age-verification systems. These suits, filed by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation on behalf of a minor, mark the first time a minor has sought legal remedy through state age-verification laws. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach believes these actions, combined with his office's lawsuit against a porn site, indicate the law is functioning as intended, holding companies accountable for marketing material accessible to minors. The article highlights the debate over the effectiveness and compliance of age-verification mechanisms, with one company insisting its site is fully compliant with Kansas law.</p>

          <p>The US is finally seeing a decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional figures showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This progress is attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, which is highly effective in preventing overdose deaths when administered promptly. Policies such as over-the-counter naloxone access and telehealth for addiction treatment have also contributed to the decline. The article highlights the positive impact of these interventions while noting ongoing challenges with stimulant-related deaths and potential funding cuts for naloxone distribution.</p>
