          <p>Taylor Swift has announced she has successfully bought back the rights to her first six studio albums, which were previously sold to Scooter Braun in 2019. Swift expressed immense joy and gratitude, emphasizing the importance of owning her music outright. She had previously committed to re-recording these albums to regain control, releasing "Taylor's Version" editions of "Fearless," "Red," "Speak Now," and "1989." However, Swift noted that she has delayed re-recording "Reputation" due to its personal significance and the difficulty in improving upon the original, but has fully re-recorded her self-titled debut album. The article conveys Swift's excitement and determination in reclaiming her artistic legacy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's official role at President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ended, but his political influence is expected to persist, particularly concerning the upcoming midterm elections. Trump praised Musk's efforts to overhaul and downsize the federal government, but behind the scenes, Musk's controversial methods and criticisms of Trump's "big beautiful bill" caused friction. Democrats plan to target Musk's involvement in DOGE during the midterms, while some Republicans believe his work on reducing government waste will resonate with voters. The article analyzes the mixed reactions to Musk's tenure and his potential impact on the political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In today's economy, where home prices and equity levels have surged, homeowners need to carefully consider how much home equity to borrow. While interest rates on home equity loans and HELOCs are relatively low, borrowers should only borrow an amount they can comfortably repay. Factors like inflation, interest rate predictions, and repayment structures should be considered to prevent any threat of foreclosure. Calculating monthly payment costs and understanding the potential short- and long-term affordability will help homeowners determine an appropriate amount of equity to borrow.

          <p>Taylor Swift has successfully bought back the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running battle over the ownership of her music. The saga began in 2019 when Scooter Braun acquired Swift's former record label, Big Machine, gaining control of her early discography. Swift responded by vowing to re-record those albums, releasing "Taylor's Versions" to diminish the value of the original masters. She has yet to complete the project, pausing on the "Reputation" album due to its personal significance, but has every intention to release the vault tracks at a later date.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, citing factors such as financial burdens, career priorities, and climate change. The author suggests that a redefinition of "harm" and "trauma" has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. Millennials expect parents to provide not only basic needs but also support successful careers and ensure their children's mental health and happiness into adulthood. The article examines the cultural shifts that have made parenthood a more daunting prospect for this generation.</p>
