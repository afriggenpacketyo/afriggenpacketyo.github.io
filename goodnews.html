          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 13:19:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the income, several financial strategies are available. Experts suggest options such as reinvesting the funds into a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for continued growth. Another popular method is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) directly from an IRA to a nonprofit, which satisfies the RMD requirement without increasing taxable income. For those focused on legacy planning, using the withdrawn money to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members is also a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed a 2.7% annual increase, slightly below economists' expectations, with a 0.2% monthly rise. While overall inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, falling gasoline prices helped temper the figures. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose to its highest level in five months, and food prices continue to climb, adding financial stress for many American households. Analysts believe these figures are unlikely to prevent a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts on Wall Street are increasingly optimistic about the turnaround plan for Starbucks, led by CEO Brian Niccol. Investment firm Baird recently upgraded the company's stock to a buy rating, citing "high conviction" in Niccol's strategy to improve store operations and customer service through the new "Green Apron" model. Early results from pilot stores show significant improvements in service speed, prompting an accelerated rollout to all U.S. locations. This positive sentiment reflects a belief that Niccol's focus on operational efficiency and restoring the classic coffeehouse atmosphere will drive stronger sales and profits in the coming year.

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a move backed by several of its investors. This offer comes in the wake of a U.S. Department of Justice proposal that Google divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, is positioning itself as a major player in the competitive AI landscape. The potential acquisition would dramatically reshape the browser market and challenge Google's long-standing dominance by separating the popular browser from its parent company's control.</p>

The reveal was made on the "New Heights" podcast, hosted by her boyfriend Travis Kelce, following a series of cryptic social media posts and a countdown clock on her website. While a release date has not been set, the album is available for preorder, and associated playlists suggest a return to collaboration with pop producers Max Martin and Shellback. This new project follows her 2024 album "The Tortured Poets Department" and her recent success in re-purchasing her original master recordings.</p>

          <p>Just as artificial intelligence fueled a boom in data center construction, the emerging field of quantum computing is expected to create its own real estate revolution. A new report from JLL suggests that as quantum technology becomes commercially viable, likely within the next five years, it will require specialized facilities. These supercomputers need unique infrastructure, including electromagnetic shielding, that cannot be housed in traditional data centers. Development is currently concentrated near research hubs like Chicago and Boston, signaling a new, specialized sector for commercial real estate investment and construction.

This strong performance comes as financial institutions show greater interest in stablecoins, supported by more favorable crypto legislation like the recently passed GENIUS Act. Circle also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain, named Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the safety of annuities as a retirement investment, especially amid current economic conditions of high interest rates and persistent inflation. The security of an annuity depends heavily on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, as they are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, the biggest long-term risk is often inflation eroding the purchasing power of fixed payments. Different types of annuities, such as fixed, variable, and indexed, carry vastly different risk profiles that potential investors must carefully consider for their financial goals.

          <p>In this opinion piece, author Anne Lamott reflects on the overwhelming nature of current political turmoil and proposes an unconventional coping mechanism: embracing absurdity and humor. Drawing inspiration from the comedy of Monty Python, she argues that laughter is a form of fearless hope that can disrupt the power of bullies and narcissists who rule by fear. Lamott suggests that while activism and civic duty are essential, rediscovering joy and silliness can provide the emotional resilience needed to confront societal darkness. She concludes that doing hopeful things, like getting a manicure or singing a silly song, can help maintain one's spirit.</p>

Grealish stated that conversations with Everton manager David Moyes were decisive in his move, and he aims to regain his place in the England national squad.

It calculates that such a deposit could earn over a thousand dollars on a three-month term and potentially tens of thousands over a five-year term. While CDs offer guaranteed returns and security, the article notes the trade-off is lower potential profit compared to stocks and the restriction of locking funds away for a set period.

In an interview, the six cast members, who were not friends before filming, described a high-friction environment that led to intense arguments and viral moments. Despite the on-screen conflict, the women say they also formed bonds of friendship and mutual support.
