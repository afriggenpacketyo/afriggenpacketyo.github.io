          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff and reassigning roles. This move comes weeks after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser, with Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance‚Äôs national security advisor, taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. The downsizing aligns with President Trump's preference for a top-down approach to foreign policy decision-making, though some experts worry about the impact of fewer staff members on the NSC's ability to control the bureaucracy. The changes follow previous staff firings amid loyalty concerns.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Global Change Biology indicates that the prevalence of hummingbird feeders has influenced the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbird beaks in the western United States. The beaks have become longer and more slender, facilitating nectar consumption from feeders, and male beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competition. This adaptation has also enabled the hummingbirds to expand their range northward into cooler climates. Researchers analyzed museum specimens and newspaper archives to correlate feeder mentions with bird counts, demonstrating the rapid pace of evolution in response to human activities.</p>

          <p>A US judge overturned President Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed a lawyer who investigated him. The order had suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings and officials. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the US Constitution, stating that the order targeted Jenner & Block because of the causes it champions and the clients it represents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prevent international students from attending Harvard University. Harvard sued the administration, accusing it of a "campaign of retribution." The judge agreed that the implementation would cause "immediate and irreparable injury" to the university. The Trump administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with demands for information on student visa holders, but Harvard argued it had been working to comply with the requests.</p>
