          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that her conviction violated a 2008 non-prosecution agreement Epstein had secured with federal prosecutors in Florida. The court's decision effectively exhausts her primary legal avenues to overturn the conviction. Her legal team has vowed to continue pursuing other options to secure her release.</p>

          <p>According to a report from Adobe Analytics, U.S. online holiday spending is projected to grow by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a slower pace than the 8.7% growth seen last year. This moderated growth reflects a more cautious consumer, who is actively seeking discounts amid economic uncertainty. The report anticipates that mobile shopping will account for over half of all online sales for the first time. Despite the slowdown, spending is expected to remain resilient as consumers prioritize holiday celebrations and capitalize on promotional events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Both gold and bitcoin have reached record price levels, fueled by a combination of geopolitical instability, concerns over U.S. government debt, and the ongoing government shutdown. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, has surged past $3,900 per ounce, while bitcoin broke the $125,000 barrier, partly due to President Trump's pro-crypto stance. Analysts note that increased demand from institutional investors through ETFs is also a significant factor for both assets. The trend reflects a broader search for alternatives to the U.S. dollar amid global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Their work identified a specific type of T-cell, known as regulatory T-cells (T-regs), and the gene Foxp3 that controls them, which are crucial for preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. These discoveries have opened a new field of immunology, paving the way for potential treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The laureates will share the prize of nearly $1.2 million.</p>

While national average yields for one- to five-year CDs are below 2%, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some six-month and one-year CDs offering over 4% APY. The article explains that short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve.
