          <p>A growing movement across the Caribbean is seeing people reconnect with their African heritage through cultural, economic, and social means. This renewed pan-Africanism is being expressed through interest in African food, music like Afrobeats, and increased travel to the continent. The trend is distinct from past movements due to the influence of social media and a stronger focus on building tangible economic ties, such as improved trade and transportation links. Leaders from both regions are collaborating to foster this relationship, viewing it as a way to forge a shared identity and future.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This development, described as a "game-changing" concession, emerged from the recent summit between President Trump and Putin in Alaska. Such a guarantee could provide a viable alternative to Ukraine's full NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Russia. While European and Ukrainian leaders have welcomed the news, they have also stressed that the specific details of how such a security arrangement would function remain unclear.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship, capitalizing on a difficult final round for Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who had entered the day with a four-shot lead. MacIntyre struggled from the start with consecutive bogeys and finished with a three-over-par 73. Scheffler demonstrated his resilience, closing with a three-under 67, highlighted by a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole that effectively sealed his win. A visibly frustrated MacIntyre expressed his disappointment, stating he felt an urge to "smash up my golf clubs" after the unexpected turn of events.</p>

          <p>Two of China's leading drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful launch of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent. The trend indicates a strategic shift for these companies, moving from reliance on generic drugs to focusing on more profitable, novel pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a pivotal moment as it chooses its next leader, with a contest that highlights a strategic divide within the party. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bold, "eco-populist" approach to connect with voter anger, contrasting with the more moderate, broad-appeal strategy of current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns. The debate centers on whether the party should adopt a more radical, anti-elite message to capitalize on political discontent or continue with the locally-focused, pragmatic approach that recently quadrupled its parliamentary seats. The outcome will determine the party's direction ahead of the next general election.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its two-decade-long mission to identify victims of the September 11th attacks, utilizing cutting-edge DNA technology. This persistent effort recently led to the first-time identification of remains belonging to John Niven, a victim from the South Tower, bringing a form of closure to his family after 22 years. Despite the degradation of remains due to extreme conditions, new methods like cryogenic grinding and advanced DNA amplification are making new matches possible.

The discussions involved high-level officials from both nations, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng.
