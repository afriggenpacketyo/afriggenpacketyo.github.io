          <p>Following the conclusion of this year's Glastonbury Festival, which was headlined by Olivia Rodrigo, thousands of attendees have begun their journey home from Worthy Farm. The end of the event marks the beginning of a major clean-up operation, with volunteers working to clear the site of rubbish and abandoned belongings. Organizers have urged festival-goers to take all their possessions with them to assist in the effort. The festival will now take a fallow year in 2026, with plans to return in 2027 after a period of rest and improvement for the land.</p>

          <p>A recent survey has revealed that Japan's same-sex partnership system, first introduced in 2015, is now available to 92.5 percent of the country's population. The system has been implemented by 530 local governments, though the certificates issued are not legally valid and do not confer the same rights as marriage, such as inheritance or spousal tax deductions. This widespread adoption comes as lawsuits across the country challenge the constitutionality of the national ban on same-sex marriage, with advocates highlighting the progress while continuing to push for full legal equality.</p>

          <p>A law enforcement group is highlighting a correlation between increased police budgets and a decline in homicide rates in several major US cities during the first quarter of 2025. Data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association shows that cities like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Denver, which all boosted police funding, saw significant year-to-date drops in murders. A spokesperson for the National Police Association described this trend as an "absolute rejection" of the 'defund the police' movement. The article suggests that greater resources for law enforcement are contributing to improved public safety in these urban areas.</p>

Beijing had initially suspended food imports from those areas in July 2023 before expanding it to a full ban on all Japanese aquatic products a month later.

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially taken effect, immediately lowering tariffs on British car exports from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles annually. This change is expected to restart vehicle shipments, which had paused due to the higher levies.

The business secretary also received assurances that automaker Lotus has no plans to close its UK plant. (not investment advice)</p>
