          <p>Manchester United has finalized the acquisition of winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial fee of £65 million. The 25-year-old Cameroon international signed a five-year contract, becoming manager Ruben Amorim's third summer signing after a lengthy negotiation process. Mbeumo expressed his excitement, calling the move a dream come true and highlighting his desire to help the team challenge for major trophies. His impressive record of 20 goals and seven assists in the Premier League last season is expected to significantly bolster United's attack.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with high credit card debt, debt management programs offer a potential solution by consolidating payments and negotiating lower interest rates. To qualify, applicants generally must meet three key requirements. First, they need a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new single monthly payment. Second, the debt must be primarily unsecured, such as credit cards or personal loans, and fall within the program's minimum and maximum limits. Finally, applicants must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which often includes closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel, 76, has offered a reassuring update on his health after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder. In May, he had canceled all concerts due to symptoms like hearing, vision, and balance problems. Speaking on a podcast, Joel stated that he feels good and that the condition sounds worse than it feels, though he often feels like he's on a boat. The update comes as HBO airs a two-part documentary, "Billy Joel: And So It Goes," chronicling his life and career, with the second part premiering this Friday.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major shift in its long-standing boarding policy, confirming that it will transition to assigned seating starting January 27, 2026. This move ends the carrier's iconic open seating system, where passengers chose seats as they boarded. The airline stated that the new policy will unlock new opportunities, including the ability to sell extra-legroom seats. Alongside this change, Southwest is also overhauling its boarding process, creating a new sequence with eight groups based on seat location and loyalty status, aiming for a more efficient customer experience.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has directed the withdrawal of approximately 700 U.S. Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles in early June. The troops were sent to the city amidst federal immigration raids and protests, a controversial decision denounced by local officials. With the Pentagon stating that stability has returned to the city, the Marines will now be redeployed. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who had called the military presence inappropriate, hailed the withdrawal as a "win for Los Angeles," emphasizing that troops should be engaged in their enlisted duties, not policing city streets.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, set to be available this fall, just months after its $1.95 billion acquisition of the functional soda brand Poppi. The new beverage aims to capture health-conscious consumers by offering three grams of prebiotic fiber, tapping into the growing gut-health trend. This move is part of Pepsi's strategy to innovate and attract customers as traditional soda consumption declines in the U.S. The new cola will be sweetened with cane sugar, distinguishing it from classic Pepsi, which uses corn syrup in the American market.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being viewed as a landmark moment for Muslim and South Asian Americans.

Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, his campaign has galvanized communities and is seen as a sign of growing political power and a new voice in American politics.</p>

          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 annually, many students rely on federal loans, which come with specific borrowing limits to encourage responsible debt management. For dependent undergraduates, the annual loan limits range from $5,500 to $7,500, with a lifetime maximum of $31,000. Independent undergraduates have higher limits, up to $12,500 annually and a $57,500 aggregate cap. Graduate students can borrow up to $20,500 per year. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to supplement with private loans, which require credit checks but can offer competitive rates.</p>

          <p>State Senator Omar Fateh, a democratic socialist, has won the endorsement of Minneapolis's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party for mayor, defeating incumbent Jacob Frey. This victory signals growing momentum for the progressive left, following a similar primary win in New York City. Fateh, the first Somali American and Muslim in the Minnesota state senate, campaigned on a platform of affordability and building a city that works for everyone. While Frey's campaign is appealing the results citing voting irregularities, Fateh's endorsement represents a significant mandate for change from party delegates ahead of the November election.</p>

While Hermon's father was in a coma, Ray was the night nurse who not only cared for his father but also connected with Hermon over shared interests. When Hermon made the difficult decision to remove life support, Ray, who was an assistant in the operating room, ran to embrace him in the hallway afterward. This unexpected act of shared grief and compassion from a near-stranger provided immense comfort in a moment of utter loneliness.</p>
