          <p>A bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers, led by former House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Defence Minister Dong Jun in Beijing. This marks the first visit by House members to China since 2019 and is part of an effort to re-establish military communication channels, which were severed in 2022. The U.S. delegation expressed a desire to open lines of communication on peace and security and to recalibrate the bilateral relationship on diplomatic, economic, and security fronts. The visit is seen as a crucial step in managing tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop is experiencing significant financial success, with record-breaking revenue and its stock price up roughly 60% year-to-date. The company has effectively navigated retail challenges like dwindling mall traffic and tariffs by diversifying its locations into cruise ships and amusement parks and by marketing to nostalgic adults. CEO Sharon Price John attributes the growth to forward-looking strategies and tapping into the current 'kidulting' trend, where adults engage in youthful activities. This strategy, combined with a constantly evolving product line, has allowed the brand to maintain its appeal and financial health in a tough macroeconomic environment.</p>

          <p>Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams had a career-best game, leading his team to a decisive 31-14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. After an inconsistent start to the season, Williams showcased the explosive talent that made him a first-overall draft pick, throwing for four touchdowns and avoiding any sacks for the first time in his professional career. The performance was a crucial validation for the partnership between Williams and new head coach Ben Johnson, whose offensive scheme finally clicked. While the Cowboys' defense is struggling, the game offered a glimpse of the Bears' potential and provided a much-needed sense of optimism for the long-suffering franchise.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani is facing a coordinated opposition campaign funded by some of the city's wealthiest landlords, billionaires, and business leaders. These powerful figures are alarmed by Mamdani's progressive platform, which includes a rent freeze and a modest tax increase on the top 1%. They have poured millions of dollars into supporting his opponent, former governor Andrew Cuomo, in an effort to prevent Mamdani's election. Despite this financial opposition, polls show Mamdani holding a commanding lead, suggesting that the influence of big-money donors may be waning among New York voters.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Family Investment Offices Remain Bullish on Direct Deals, Survey Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey by Citi Private Bank reveals that family offices, the private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, remain optimistic about their returns despite economic uncertainty. Nearly half of the 346 firms surveyed anticipate returns between 5% and 10% for 2025, with many increasing their exposure to direct investments in private companies. These firms are reportedly targeting long-term trends like artificial intelligence and new infrastructure. However, they are showing less interest in early-stage and startup funding, preferring the perceived safety of growth-stage investments and opportunistic secondary market purchases.

          <h2>A Guide to the Key Differences Between ETFs and Mutual Funds for Investors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are both popular investment vehicles, but they have key differences in trading, tax efficiency, and cost that investors should understand. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange throughout the day, while mutual funds are priced once at the end of the day. A significant advantage for ETFs held in taxable accounts is their tax efficiency, as their structure rarely generates the capital gains distributions common with mutual funds. Furthermore, ETFs generally have lower annual fees, or expense ratios, than their mutual fund counterparts, making them a cheaper option for many investors.</p>

          <p>Despite a bleak political climate, environmentalist Bill McKibben expresses optimism about the rapid advancements in solar and wind power, which are now the world's cheapest energy sources. In an interview about his new book, he argues that the economic viability of renewables is fundamentally changing the energy landscape, even in politically conservative states like Texas. McKibben acknowledges that while global warming cannot be stopped entirely, the goal is to mitigate its worst effects by transitioning away from fossil fuels. He emphasizes that this shift is no longer just an environmental ideal but a pragmatic economic reality that can proceed despite political opposition.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is proposing that social media apps display cigarette-style health warnings to protect children's mental health from what they call "addictive algorithms." The plan, announced at the party's conference, also includes a two-hour daily cap on "doomscrolling" through short-form video feeds for users under 18. Citing research linking excessive social media use to anxiety and sleep disruption, the party argues that these platforms pose a public health risk that warrants clear warnings, similar to those on tobacco and alcohol products. The proposal aims to ensure young users are aware of the potential harms before they engage with the apps.</p>

          <p>Achieving a retirement income of $12,000 per month, or $144,000 annually, requires a substantial nest egg, significantly higher than the average American's savings. Using the standard 4% withdrawal rule, a retiree would need approximately $3.6 million in savings to generate this level of income. However, factors like inflation and longevity risk mean the actual number could be even higher to maintain purchasing power over a multi-decade retirement. The article highlights the challenge of planning for a comfortable, upper-middle-class retirement, contrasting this target with the median retirement income of around $55,000 per year.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has indicated he is open to resuming negotiations with the United States, provided that Washington abandons its demand for complete denuclearization. Speaking to the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim stated that if the U.S. seeks peaceful coexistence based on the "recognition of reality," there is no reason not to engage in dialogue, and he mentioned having good memories of President Trump. This statement represents one of his clearest signals for reviving diplomacy, which has been stalled since 2019. Kim also emphasized that North Korea's status as a nuclear state is irreversible and constitutionally enshrined for survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved an implantable device that uses electrical pulses to treat rheumatoid arthritis in patients who do not respond to medication. The device, made by SetPoint Medical, stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck, which sends signals to the brain and spleen to reduce the production of inflammatory proteins called cytokines. While not a cure for all, a clinical trial showed that 35% of patients in a difficult-to-treat group experienced meaningful improvement in their symptoms. This approval marks a potential turning point for treating autoimmune diseases by leveraging the body's own neural pathways to control inflammation.</p>
