          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their stadium. The event was bittersweet for the 740 graduating seniors, as they were unable to celebrate at their beloved Stadium by the Sea. The January fire destroyed homes of students, faculty, and board members, forcing the school to relocate classes to a former Sears building. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal offered words of encouragement, acknowledging the students' resilience in the face of adversity. The Hollywood Bowl was gifted to the school by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, with logistical support from school board member Nick Melvoin.</p>

          <h2>Feather Fossil Study Reveals Bird Evolution</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, focusing on 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, highlights the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift as a critical step in bird evolution. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences believe this development allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. While many dinosaurs had feathers, most lacked the ability to fly like modern birds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may offer protection against dangerous infections. The study found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in infants halved the risk of hospitalization due to lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. This is a promising discovery that could lead to new therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women to stop using weight-loss jabs if they are trying for a baby, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it's not known whether medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby. Natasha Major, who was using Mounjaro, stopped immediately upon discovering she was pregnant. The MHRA also advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there, has been flown back to the US following a judge's order. Judge Brian Murphy had ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return after it was revealed that the claim he wasn't afraid of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information. OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala. Another federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a prison in El Salvador a chance to challenge their deportations.</p>
