The findings come as China faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce and strained social welfare system, with the overall fertility rate estimated at 1.1 children per woman.</p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai advocates for a paradigm shift in how we approach artificial intelligence, suggesting we ‚Äúparent‚Äù these systems as if they were our children. De Kai argues that AI is a change to the social climate that humanity is competing in, requiring us to be conscientious about who we are around our AI ‚Äúchildren.‚Äù The new book, Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future, emphasizes the importance of good role models for AI systems, given their learning from our online activities.</p>
