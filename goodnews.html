          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant setback to his economic agenda. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unilateral power to impose sweeping tariffs. The ruling stated that the tariffs exceeded the authority granted by IEEPA and failed to address the threats outlined in the orders. The Trump administration has swiftly appealed the ruling, setting up a potential legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies. The court stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal against the ruling. The lawsuit was filed by small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, marking a major legal challenge to Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
