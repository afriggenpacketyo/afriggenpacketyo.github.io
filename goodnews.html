          <p>Circle Internet Group reported a 53% jump in second-quarter revenue, driven by strong growth in its USDC stablecoin, causing its stock to soar. In its first earnings report as a public company, it revealed a net loss due to one-time IPO-related charges, but investors focused on the strong underlying performance. The company also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain called Arc, signaling confidence amid a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment for digital currencies.</p>

She argues for embracing absurdity and humor, specifically the work of Monty Python, as a form of fearless resistance against authoritarianism and cruelty. Lamott suggests that small acts of joy and kindness, like getting a manicure, are vital forms of self-preservation and defiance that can help maintain one's spirit and humanity.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made a surprise $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a figure higher than the startup's own valuation. The move comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered answer engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal, escalating the competition in the generative AI space.</p>

Grealish stated that conversations with Everton manager David Moyes were key to his decision, as he aims to regain his form and a spot in the England national squad.</p>

          <p>For investors seeking stability amid stock market volatility, a certificate of deposit (CD) can offer a secure, fixed-rate return. With current interest rates, a $100,000 deposit could earn over a thousand dollars on a short-term 3-month CD and potentially over $22,000 on a 5-year CD. While these returns may be lower than potential stock market gains, they provide predictability and security for principal, making them an attractive option for risk-averse savers.
