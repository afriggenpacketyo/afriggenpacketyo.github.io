          <h2>Federal Reserve to Reduce Staff by 10% in Coming Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 14:51:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to reduce the Fed's headcount by 10% over the next few years, citing the need to consolidate functions and modernize business practices. The reduction will include offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees. This move comes as the Trump administration pushes for cost cuts across civil service agencies, though Powell's memo did not explicitly mention this as a factor. The Fed's 2023 annual report indicated nearly 24,000 employees, meaning the reduction would bring the number below 22,000.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank announced that Syria's $15.5 million debt has been cleared following payments by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making the country eligible for grants to support reconstruction and economic recovery. This move is seen as a victory for Syria's new government, which is attempting to stabilize the nation after years of civil war and dictatorship. The debt relief follows the lifting of US sanctions on Syria by President Trump and a meeting between Trump and Syria's new president. This has led to increased confidence among international investors and a growing optimism in Syria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East focused on securing deals and investments for the United States, with Gulf states obliging through arms deals, investments, and the purchase of Boeing planes. Qatar gifted Trump a 747 to replace Air Force One, a gesture met with criticism due to potential violations of the Emoluments Clause. Trump's approach prioritized transactions over discussions about democracy or human rights, focusing on a Middle East defined by commerce and technology. The trip also touched on issues such as Syria, Iran, Gaza, and Ukraine, with Trump making promises about ending wars but facing challenges with key leaders.</p>

          <p>The tech IPO market is showing signs of life after an extended drought, with stock brokerage platform eToro's successful Nasdaq debut and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave's strong performance. However, the market faced setbacks earlier in the year due to tariff policies, causing companies like Klarna and StubHub to delay their offerings. While the first quarter saw the highest quarterly value for venture firm exits since 2021, much of it was attributed to CoreWeave's IPO. eToro's recent success could encourage other companies to pursue IPOs.</p>
