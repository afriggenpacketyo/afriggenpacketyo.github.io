This wealth creation is heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, fueling a resurgence in the local economy and real estate market, though much of the wealth remains illiquid in private companies.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like school supplies and disaster preparedness goods. While politically popular and helpful for some families managing tight budgets, tax experts argue the benefits are often overstated. Research suggests these holidays primarily shift the timing of purchases rather than stimulating new economic growth, and wealthier consumers may be better positioned to take advantage of the savings.</p>

          <p>This article from Vox examines why people, and the media, tend to focus on negative news, a phenomenon rooted in an evolutionary trait known as negativity bias. Despite constant reports of crises, significant progress is often overlooked, such as a potential historic low in the U.S. murder rate and fewer global deaths from extreme weather. The author argues that acknowledging positive developments is not naive but essential for fostering realistic optimism, which can inspire action and build resilience against a challenging future.</p>

          <p>A fragment of a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be older than our planet. Researchers determined the object is a chondrite meteorite, formed approximately 4.56 billion years ago, about 20 million years before Earth. The event, which caused a loud boom heard across several states, marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, with scientists hoping its study will aid in understanding potential asteroid threats.</p>

          <p>Miami's Freedom Tower, a historic landmark that served as a processing center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s, is reopening after a major refurbishment. The new exhibition, "Libertad," focuses on the personal stories of the more than half a million Cubans who passed through its doors, including oral histories from former child refugees. Known as "el refugio" (the shelter), the tower's restoration aims to preserve the poignant history of those who fled Fidel Castro's regime and began new lives in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Author Explores a Nuanced Approach to Eating Disorder Recovery Beyond Perfection</h2>

          <p>In her book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley discusses her lifelong journey with an eating disorder, advocating for a more realistic view of recovery. She describes living in a "middle place" between acute illness and full recovery, arguing that the perfectionist goal of being completely "cured" can be counterproductive. By reframing setbacks as "slips" rather than failures, she has found it possible to live a fulfilling life, a message that resonates as diet culture resurges in new forms.</p>

          <p>A Vox advice column addresses a reader struggling to maintain a vegetarian diet due to health issues, suggesting a pragmatic, "reducetarian" approach to minimize animal suffering without complete abstinence. The article contrasts absolute moral duties with a utilitarian goal of reducing harm, recommending choices like eating pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products. It also suggests consuming larger animals like cows instead of chickens to reduce the total number of lives affected, while providing guidance on navigating misleading food labels.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade, signaling a renewed commitment to establishing a permanent lunar base. This move is framed as essential for powering a long-term human presence, where temperatures can plummet to –410 degrees Fahrenheit during the 14-day lunar nights. The push is also driven by geopolitical competition, as China and Russia are collaborating on their own, more powerful nuclear-powered lunar base, raising national security concerns.</p>

          <p>In a culture feature, an Atlantic writer recommends Michael Young's 1958 satirical novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy." The book, which coined the term "meritocracy" as a pejorative, imagines a dystopian future where society is stratified by educational achievement rather than class, culminating in a populist rebellion. The writer notes the book's relevance today, as it critiques a system where an educated elite governs, a theme that resonates with contemporary political discourse and social tensions.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California is planning for a more resilient water future. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes building a massive wastewater recycling facility, capturing more stormwater, and potentially desalination to create a "new and endless river." These costly investments are deemed necessary to avoid a "Day Zero" crisis, similar to what Cape Town, South Africa, narrowly averted, ensuring long-term sustainability and affordability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the "sponge city" concept, a nature-based approach to urban water management that uses absorbent landscapes to mitigate flooding and capture stormwater. Championed by landscape architect Kongjian Yu, the model has been implemented in cities like Bangkok and across China, turning concrete-heavy areas into green spaces with wetlands and porous surfaces. This strategy is gaining traction in places like Los Angeles, which discards billions of gallons of rainwater, as a way to become more resilient to climate change-induced droughts and floods.</p>
