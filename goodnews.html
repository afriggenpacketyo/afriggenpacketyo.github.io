          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. forces in December 1942. Found over 2,600 feet deep near the Solomon Islands, the warship's discovery provides new historical insights, as no photographs of it were known to exist. The wreckage, located in two pieces, was found with its munitions, including sensitive depth charges, still intact, challenging previous theories about the cause of its sinking. The find is part of ongoing efforts to map the historic "Iron Bottom Sound," a site of numerous naval battles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on two significant pieces of cryptocurrency legislation, marking a pivotal week for the industry in Washington. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill that has already passed the Senate, is expected to become law. A more comprehensive bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC, but faces a more uncertain path in the Senate due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto ventures. The industry is heavily lobbying for its passage to establish clear rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to procure rare earth magnets produced in the United States, a move aimed at strengthening its domestic supply chain. The deal includes the purchase of magnets from MP Materials' Texas facility and collaboration on a new recycling line in California.

The announcement caused MP Materials' stock to surge by 24%, highlighting the significance of securing these critical components for consumer electronics.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has stated that the bank will get involved with stablecoins, despite his personal skepticism about their utility compared to traditional payment systems. Dimon acknowledged the competitive threat from fintech companies that are leveraging such technologies to enter the banking and payments space. The move signifies a strategic decision by the nation's largest bank to explore and understand the technology to avoid being left behind. This follows the bank's earlier announcement of a more limited, internal "deposit coin" and comes as other major banks like Citigroup also explore stablecoin issuance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey from the Pew Research Center indicates that public opinion toward China is becoming more positive in key Latin American countries, including Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. This trend contrasts sharply with sentiment in many high-income Western nations, where views of China remain largely negative. Despite this growing favorability, the poll also found that many in the region still consider the United States to be a more important economic ally. The research was conducted before and during the initial announcement of President Trump's global tariff policies, which could influence future perceptions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a major deal with NATO allies to provide a new, large-scale supply of weapons to Ukraine, including critically needed Patriot missile systems. In a significant policy shift, Trump stated that European allies would pay for the U.S.-made equipment, with initial deliveries arriving from European stockpiles within days. He also issued a 50-day deadline to Russia to reach a peace agreement or face severe "secondary tariffs" on its trading partners. This marks a change in tone from the administration, with Trump expressing new admiration for Ukraine's courage and European resolve.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Emmy nominations produced a familiar mix of predictable outcomes and surprising turns. "The White Lotus" received overwhelming love from voters, securing seven acting nominations for its regular cast, which some felt was excessive. In contrast, the acclaimed medical drama "The Pitt" was largely overlooked in the acting categories. Major snubs included Steve Martin for "Only Murders in the Building" and the comedy series "The Rehearsal," while Sharon Horgan for "Bad Sisters" and the dystopian series "Paradise" were unexpected but welcome inclusions. The list reflects a competitive year with fewer available nomination slots.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler, despite his immense success including three major titles, has revealed he wrestles daily with his motivation for playing the sport. Speaking ahead of The Open Championship, he described the pursuit of victory as "not a fulfilling life" in the deepest sense, as the euphoric feeling of winning is brief. Scheffler emphasized that his family is his top priority and that he would quit golf if it ever negatively impacted his home life. He stated that being a great father is more important to him than being a great golfer, offering a candid perspective on the pressures of elite sport.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to nearly double its value from a year ago, briefly surpassing $123,000, driven by structural market changes rather than retail speculation. Massive inflows into new spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $153 billion in assets, have tightened supply and attracted institutional investors. This wave of adoption includes financial advisors, corporate treasuries, and even sovereign wealth funds. The rally is also supported by a technical short squeeze and the prospect of clearer U.S. regulations, with Congress considering landmark crypto bills that could define oversight and encourage further mainstream financial integration.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly attempting to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike in what could be a club-record deal, with an initial £70m bid being turned down. The move for the 23-year-old French striker has led some fans to worry it could signal the potential sale of their star player, Alexander Isak, who is a known target for Liverpool. However, the club maintains Isak is not for sale and that the interest in Ekitike reflects a desire to build a more versatile, multi-layered attack. Ekitike's ability to play in multiple forward positions could allow him to partner with Isak rather than replace him.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic gesture, China has lifted the sanctions it imposed in 2021 on Reinhard Buetikofer, a prominent former German member of the European Parliament. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to repair and normalize its relationship with the European Parliament. This development is expected to pave the way for the resumption of official meetings between the EU institution and China's National People's Congress, which have been frozen since 2018. The lifting of sanctions on Buetikofer, a vocal critic of Beijing, was reportedly a key demand from the European side before considering renewed engagement.</p>

The 20-day mission to the International Space Station was commanded by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and included crewmates from India, Poland, and Hungary. During their time in orbit, the crew conducted numerous science experiments and technology demonstrations. These commercial flights are part of Axiom's strategy to gain experience as it develops its own commercial space station, intended to succeed the ISS after its retirement.</p>
