          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has formally endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the contentious race to replace him, just two days before early voting begins. This endorsement signifies a notable reconciliation between the two political figures, who had previously engaged in public disputes. Adams, having recently exited the mayoral race, strongly criticized Democratic nominee Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's rent freeze promises, labeling him a "snake oil salesman" and an "existential threat" to the city's future. Cuomo, running as an independent, reinforced these views, characterizing Mamdani as a "socialist" and raising concerns about his experience and controversial stances on various community issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but subsequently lowered its 2025 guidance, primarily attributing the adjustment to the disruptive impact of a recent supplier fire. The fire at an aluminum supplier plant is projected to cost Ford between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, significantly disrupting production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs. Despite this challenge, Ford plans to mitigate much of the financial impact by significantly increasing U.S. pickup truck production next year, which includes adding 1,000 workers to its Michigan and Kentucky plants. The company's CEO expressed confidence in accelerating efforts to restore overall plant production sooner than initially expected, aiming to recoup about half of the 100,000 units anticipated to be lost this year.

Starting as a $6-an-hour cab dispatcher, he eventually owned a taxi fleet and launched a dispatch company. In 2019, he diversified by opening Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist, inspired by his mother's salon experience. Despite facing significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic which forced him to incur substantial debt and make personal sacrifices, Singh persevered by enrolling in barber school and expanding Dandies to three locations. He now earns a $7,000 monthly salary and plans to launch a third business, Barber's Network, embodying a strong work ethic he attributes to his childhood experiences.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected revenue in its third-quarter earnings, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs, causing its stock to jump 6%. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became a top shareholder with an $8.9 billion investment, which Intel welcomed as a partner in restoring semiconductor production. Despite a per-share loss due to accounting for government shares, Intel's net income significantly improved year-over-year. The chipmaker also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate its CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors, indicating strategic moves to revive growth, particularly in its data center business.

          <p>Meta is laying off an unspecified number of employees in its risk organization as the company shifts to using artificial intelligence to automate its compliance review process. This change impacts the team responsible for assessing product risks and ensuring global regulatory compliance, a unit established after Meta received a $5 billion FTC fine related to its Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. While the cuts follow broader organizational restructurings, including layoffs in its AI unit, Meta clarified that its revamped risk management system relies on basic automation rather than advanced generative AI. The company aims to streamline operations, innovate faster, and maintain high compliance standards through this automation.</p>

          <p>A Colorado woman, Elizabeth Ann Davis, 61, has been found guilty of two counts of forgery and one count of impersonating an elector for illegally casting mail ballots on behalf of her late ex-husband and son in the 2022 general election. Prosecutors underscored that voter fraud, while generally rare, is detectable due to the robust safeguards within the nation’s election processes. Davis, a Republican, also has previous forgery convictions in Florida and Colorado. The District Attorney's office stated its firm intent to seek incarceration for anyone attempting to corrupt elections, even by a single ballot, reinforcing the critical commitment to electoral integrity. She faces a potential sentence of up to three years in prison.</p>

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced a significant 6% drop, its largest single-day decline in over a decade, prompting questions about investment opportunities. This article suggests that most gold types, including those sold by major retailers like Costco, are worth considering for purchase during this dip. Costco offers a convenient and potentially trustworthy path for shoppers to invest in physical bullion, which can be easily sold for profit without shipping costs for members. Historically, gold price dips are often temporary, making the current lower price an attractive entry point for investors. However, gold sales from the retailer are final, requiring careful consideration before purchase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates are currently near a two-year low, averaging 8.11% on a 5-year loan, making them an attractive borrowing option for homeowners. This article suggests that despite broader economic concerns like inflation and a government shutdown, many homeowners could benefit from applying now. These rates are significantly lower than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards, offering a more cost-effective way to access large sums. While minor rate cuts are anticipated from the Federal Reserve, their impact on home equity loans is expected to be negligible, making locking in a rate now advantageous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maia Kobabe's award-winning graphic memoir "Gender Queer," recognized as America's most banned book, is set to release an expanded annotated edition next year. The book chronicles Kobabe's journey of self-discovery regarding gender and sexuality, offering a candid look into the nonbinary author's experiences. Since its 2019 publication, the memoir has become a target in conservative, anti-LGBTQ+ culture wars, leading to widespread challenges and bans in schools and libraries. The new edition will feature commentary from Kobabe, fellow artists, and scholars, providing deeper insights into the creative process, personal journey, and the book's role in representation, particularly in a current political climate that has grown less accepting.</p>
