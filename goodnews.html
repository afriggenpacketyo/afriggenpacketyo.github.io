          <p>Son Heung-min, the captain of Tottenham Hotspur, has announced he will be leaving the club this summer, concluding a celebrated ten-year tenure. The 33-year-old South Korean forward, who is reportedly in talks with LAFC, called it the "most difficult" decision of his career, stating a need for a new environment to push himself. Son scored 173 goals for Spurs and recently captained the team to its first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League. His final appearance for the club could take place in his home country of South Korea during a pre-season friendly against Newcastle.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that while she is "Nigerian through ancestry," her identity is now firmly British, as she has spent most of her life in the UK. Badenoch, who was born in the UK and returned at age 16, mentioned she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s. Her comments follow previous criticism from Nigeria's vice-president for remarks she made about the country's past political and economic climate.</p>

          <p>Cambodia's government has announced its intention to nominate former U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in helping to broker a ceasefire agreement that ended a recent deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister, Sun Chanthol, praised Trump's efforts in bringing peace to the region after he urged both nations to end the fighting and threatened trade consequences. The conflict had displaced over 300,000 people and resulted in at least 43 deaths, making it the heaviest fighting between the two countries in over a decade.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Reveals Potato's Ancient Origins from a Tomato Ancestor Hybrid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary history of the potato, revealing an unexpected link to an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists discovered that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event approximately nine million years ago. This event involved a tomato-like forerunner and a tuberless, potato-like plant. The research, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient hybridization was the key driver for the development of tubers, the edible part that has made the potato a global food staple.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration patrols in Southern California. The ruling affirms that factors like race, language, or location alone are not sufficient for reasonable suspicion to detain someone. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups on behalf of immigrants and U.S. citizens who were targeted in raids. The court's opinion noted that if federal agents are already following the 4th Amendment as they claim, they should not be harmed by an injunction preventing unconstitutional stops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing user fatigue and declining usage, dating apps are introducing new features to reignite interest in online dating. Companies are moving beyond endless swiping and messaging, with some apps like Breeze facilitating in-person dates directly after a match, cutting out the pre-date chat. Other platforms are experimenting with group dates, invite-only celebrity matching, and tiered premium services. This shift addresses a sense of "online burnout" reported by many daters who are tired of ghosting and repetitive profiles, reflecting a broader industry effort to make online connections feel more human and less like a game.</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that 'And Just Like That...,' the sequel to 'Sex and the City,' will end after its third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated it felt like a "wonderful place to stop," while star Sarah Jessica Parker said the chapter was now "complete."

The reboot faced progressively declining viewership and criticism for its handling of diversity and for apparent plot holes, though it maintained a dedicated fanbase who expressed sadness at the show's conclusion.</p>
