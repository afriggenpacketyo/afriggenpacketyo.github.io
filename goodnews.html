          <p>Shares of Honeywell rallied significantly after the company reported strong quarterly earnings that surpassed expectations, with revenue, earnings per share, and margins meeting or exceeding guidance. The positive financial results have boosted investor confidence ahead of the planned spin-off of its advanced materials business, Solstice, next week. The company's performance is seen as a positive sign for its core operations, particularly its aerospace division. Analysts view the upcoming separation as a move that will unlock further value for the industrial conglomerate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has offered rare praise for Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, suggesting his decision to invest heavily in quarterback Dak Prescott and trade star pass rusher Micah Parsons is paying off. Smith noted that despite initial criticism, the Cowboys' offense is thriving with Prescott performing at a high level, ranking second in the NFL in both passing yards and touchdowns. He argued that if Dallas makes the playoffs and wins a game, it will vindicate Jones's strategy of building the team around his quarterback. The team's current success is challenging long-held critiques of Jones's management.</p>

          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering surged after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline in its third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. The improvement was largely driven by its main brand, Gucci, which saw its sales decline narrow significantly compared to the previous quarter. This performance beat analyst expectations and has built optimism that the management's actions to revitalize the business are taking effect. The positive report follows Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to L'Oreal to reduce debt and focus on its core fashion houses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce has joined an activist investor group aiming to implement changes at the struggling theme park operator, Six Flags. The group, which owns about 9% of the company, is pushing for improvements to the customer experience, marketing strategy, and leadership. This move adds pressure on Six Flags, which has faced financial difficulties, declining attendance, and a recent merger with Cedar Fair that has yet to produce a successful turnaround. Kelce, stating he is a lifelong fan of the parks, expressed a desire to help make them "special for the next generation."</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers. Despite the increase in sales, the housing market remains challenging, as inventory is still historically lean and home prices continue to rise, up 2.1% year-over-year. The median home price now stands at $415,200, highlighting the persistent pressure on buyers from tight supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues Conservative Movement on College Campuses is Fueled by Desire for Open Debate</h2>

          <p>A recent Stanford graduate argues in an essay that the real political energy on college campuses today can be found on the right, driven by a rejection of the stifling, offense-averse culture of the left. The author recounts their own journey from progressive to conservative, drawn to campus conservative groups as one of the few places where vigorous debate and intellectual disagreement were encouraged. The article suggests that the appeal of conservatism for many students is less about specific ideologies like Trumpism and more about a hunger for open discourse. This has led to growing interest in conservative student organizations at elite universities.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans who receive Social Security will continue to get their monthly checks during the government shutdown, as the program is covered by mandatory spending that does not require annual approval. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could disrupt other key services. According to the agency's contingency plan, tasks such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards may be halted. The shutdown could also potentially delay the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which is scheduled for mid-October.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to significantly impact most Americans seeking a mortgage, as private lenders will continue processing conventional loans. However, borrowers applying for government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, and USDA could face processing delays due to worker furloughs. The USDA is expected to halt the issuance of new loans entirely. Additionally, homebuyers in flood zones may experience complications, as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program cannot sell new or renewal policies during a shutdown, potentially delaying closings.</p>
