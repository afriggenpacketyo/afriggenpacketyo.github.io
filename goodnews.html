          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas executed a rapid 500-foot descent to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a decommissioned fighter jet shortly after departing from Burbank, California. The maneuver was prompted by an onboard traffic alert, and the FAA has launched an investigation into the incident. While no passengers were injured, one flight attendant was hospitalized for minor injuries. The event has once again brought attention to concerns regarding air traffic controller shortages and the overall safety of the airspace.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing ties with the island nation, which has recently pivoted towards China. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who previously ran on an anti-India platform, has softened his rhetoric, calling India the nation's "closest and most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic engagement is seen as a strategic move to counter China's growing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. The 2002 movie, starring Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha stated that with the rise of women's football, highlighted by the success of England's Lionesses, it felt like the right time to revisit the characters. She is considering whether the sequel will be a film or a television series and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer, following a scandal involving its former CEO. The CEO resigned after a KissCam at a Coldplay concert captured him embracing a female HR executive who was not his wife. In a promotional video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's newfound attention. The move is an unconventional attempt by Astronomer to manage the public relations fallout from the viral incident, which also led to the HR executive's resignation.</p>

          <p>Clothing brand American Eagle has experienced a notable stock price increase after launching a new advertising campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. The article posits that the campaign's success is due to its return to traditional advertising that highlights physical attractiveness, a strategy that has become less common amid a trend towards social messaging. This move is viewed as a potentially profitable shift away from what the article calls politically motivated advertising, and the market's positive response may signal a wider return to more conventional marketing tactics.

          <p>An unprecedented recall election in Taiwan, which targeted 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), has failed to unseat any of them. The result is a significant setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and President Lai Ching-te, as it ensures the opposition will retain its majority in the legislature. Supporters of the recall had accused the KMT of being too close to China and obstructing the government's agenda. The KMT, however, framed the effort as political retaliation and called the outcome a victory for democratic stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing debate about healthy coffee consumption levels has a complicated answer, as experts emphasize that tolerance is highly individualized. While the FDA suggests a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine daily, some people may experience anxiety or other negative effects with far less. Recent studies have linked moderate coffee intake to benefits like healthy aging and heart health, but heavy use can pose risks, especially for those with hypertension. Health professionals advise moderation and paying close attention to personal reactions, such as impacts on sleep or appetite.</p>
