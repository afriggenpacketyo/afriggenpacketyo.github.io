          <p>President Trump announced a planned partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, aiming to keep U.S. Steel in America and create 70,000 jobs, adding $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This announcement follows the Biden administration's previous block of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel due to national security concerns. U.S. Steel will retain its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Investors reacted positively, with shares of U.S. Steel jumping 21% following the news, but the United Steelworkers union expressed caution, emphasizing the need for more information to assess the deal's impact on American jobs.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the manhunt for escaped inmates in New Orleans has sparked controversy. While authorities credit the technology with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, civil rights organizations and politicians from both parties have raised concerns about privacy and constitutional issues. The ACLU has called for an indefinite halt to the use of live-feed facial recognition, citing potential threats to fundamental rights and the risk of racially biased outcomes. The New Orleans Police Department had previously paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. until its compliance with legal requirements is ensured.</p>

The Media Research Center (MRC) Free Speech America project highlighted Gemini's claims that Memorial Day is controversial due to issues of "inclusivity and representation" during the Jim Crow era. While Gemini acknowledged the holiday's primary purpose is to honor fallen U.S. military personnel, it also stated that the history of Memorial Day contains elements that can be viewed through the lens of race.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concert tour dates due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. His doctor advised him to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. NPH is a relatively uncommon condition, more likely to occur in older people, that involves the buildup of fluid inside or around the brain. The condition is usually treatable, often involving a surgical procedure to implant a shunt in order to drain the fluid.</p>

Harvard argued that the administration's move was a blatant violation of the First Amendment and due process. The Trump administration claimed Harvard had not complied with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students.
