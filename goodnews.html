          <p>A recent New York Times article discusses the complexities surrounding prostate cancer screening, particularly for men over 70, highlighting that guidelines advise against routine screening after this age. The article notes that some men who diligently get tested may still develop aggressive cancer between checkups, or the PSA test can miss the cancer entirely. Experts emphasize that the PSA test is not perfect and that overtreatment can lead to devastating side effects, such as impotence and incontinence. The article underscores the importance of a complex conversation between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of screening. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk has signaled his intention to scale back his political donations, a significant shift after being a major donor to President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. Musk, who spent over $250 million supporting Trump, stated at an economic conference in Qatar that he plans to do 'a lot less' spending in the future. He also reaffirmed his commitment to leading Tesla for another five years. This announcement follows criticism and scrutiny of his influence in the Trump White House, given potential conflicts of interest involving his companies' federal contracts and government investigations. </p>

          <p>UCLA presented the West Coast premiere of Tod Machover's opera 'Schoenberg in Hollywood,' a phantasmagoria exploring Arnold Schoenberg's life after fleeing Nazi Germany and settling in Los Angeles. The opera, with a libretto by Simon Robson, uses flashbacks and film accompaniment to depict Schoenberg's personal life and connections with his music. Machover's score evokes both the trauma and exhilaration of Schoenberg's spiritual progress, blending traditional instruments with new-world electronics. The performance by the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music ensemble, conducted by Neal Stulberg, navigates the high/low dichotomy, leading to a profound middle ground. </p>

          <p>Member states of the World Health Organization have overwhelmingly adopted the first-ever pandemic agreement, a treaty designed to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics. The treaty lays out a framework for preventing pandemics by boosting surveillance of animals and responding more effectively by providing protective equipment and aligning regulatory systems. However, the agreement lacks enforcement mechanisms and robust funding, and the absence of the U.S. could weaken its power. Countries still need to decide how to share tests, vaccines, and technology with lower-income countries. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency said it wants to see new clinical trials showing Covid shots are still safe and effective before approving them for healthy adults and children, a costly new requirement for pharmaceutical companies that could limit who gets new jabs each year. For adults 65 and older, and for people as young as 6 months who have certain underlying health conditions, the FDA said it will accept immunogenicity data. The new guidance comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, overhauls the nation's health agencies and U.S. immunization policy. </p>

A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Additionally, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine examined Medicaid's effects on individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, finding that those who lost Medicaid were more likely to die. These findings highlight the potential human cost of restricting access to Medicaid. </p>

He advises readers to name it, recognize it when it rises up, and detach.
