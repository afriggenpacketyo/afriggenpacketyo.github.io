          <p>Fundstrat's Tom Lee, a well-known market strategist, has been appointed chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies. The company aims to become a major public holder of Ether, mirroring MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy, and announced a $250 million private placement to fund this pivot. Lee stated that Ethereum's role in the growing stablecoin market makes it a strategic asset, and the company will track its ether-per-share value as a key performance metric. This move reflects a broader trend of companies looking beyond Bitcoin for their crypto treasury strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, D.C., as well as in a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with a disproportionate number of women and minority workers receiving raises. The increases come from a mix of voter-approved ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments. While the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009, these state and local actions reflect a continuing trend of jurisdictions independently raising their baseline pay.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large technology companies, a move aimed at restarting trade talks with the United States. The decision came just before the first tax payments were due and followed President Trump's threat to halt all trade negotiations over the issue. The 3% tax, which was to be applied retroactively, was a significant point of contention, with the U.S. viewing it as discriminatory against American firms. Canadian officials stated their preference has always been for a multilateral agreement, and this concession is intended to facilitate progress on a new comprehensive trade deal.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their home's equity face a complex interest rate environment this July. While home equity loans and HELOCs offer lower rates than credit cards, their future trajectory is uncertain. Experts note that HELOCs have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's decisions, with potential for slight decreases later this year if the Fed cuts rates. In contrast, fixed-rate home equity loans are more influenced by the mortgage bond market and may not move in lockstep with Fed actions. Lenders advise that the current market still presents a viable option for those needing funds now. (not investment advice)</p>

While Mbeumo has reportedly expressed his desire to join United, Brentford insists that any deal must be on the club's terms, emphasizing his value as one of their best players.

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its Ernie generative AI model open source, a significant move that could challenge the business models of proprietary AI providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Analysts suggest this could be a "declaration of war on pricing," making powerful AI tools more accessible and affordable for developers worldwide. While some experts question whether it will have the same market impact as previous open-source releases like DeepSeek, the move puts pressure on competitors to justify their pricing. The decision also raises questions about data security and the potential for Chinese-developed AI to become more deeply integrated into global applications.</p>

          <p>German companies are increasingly turning to Taiwan as a source for drones and their components to reduce reliance on the Chinese market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, reflecting a broader European effort to build a "non-red" supply chain independent of China. This shift is driven by security concerns and China's tightening of drone export controls. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and chips, an area where Taiwan's advanced tech sector can play a key role.</p>

Archer, who recently rejoined the squad after a four-year injury-related absence, missed a training session due to a family emergency but is expected back with the team ahead of the match. England leads the series 1-0 and will face an Indian team that may opt to rest its own star pace bowler, Jasprit Bumrah.
