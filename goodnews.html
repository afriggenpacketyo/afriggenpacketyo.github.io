          <p>China and the European Union are reportedly close to resolving their dispute over electric vehicle tariffs, with technical negotiations largely complete. According to Chinese state-affiliated media, the final agreement now depends on the "political will" of the EU. The report suggests that the core technical aspects have been settled, shifting the focus to the political decision-making required to finalize the deal. This development comes amid ongoing trade tensions, as the EU has been investigating Chinese subsidies and other trade practices it considers market-distorting.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old retired New York City police officer shares his story of surviving a major stroke that left him with only a 15% chance of survival. Waking up with numbness on his right side and blurred vision, he was rushed to the hospital where a rapid response team administered clot-busting medication, saving his life. The article details his challenging recovery, which included a tracheotomy and extensive speech therapy to regain his ability to talk and eat.

          <p>The British monarchy continues its tradition of granting Royal Warrants, a prestigious seal of approval for goods and services, with the Prince and Princess of Wales set to begin issuing them next year. These warrants are seen as a powerful marketing tool, signifying quality and class, and are influential even among American consumers. The article notes the wide range of businesses that receive this honor, from luxury car brands to chimney sweeps. It also humorously references a recent poll suggesting a surprising number of young Americans would favor being ruled by the British monarch.</p>

          <h2>OPEC+ Nations Announce Larger-Than-Expected Oil Production Increase for August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:06:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight member nations of the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August, exceeding initial expectations. This decision, which includes major producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia, is part of a gradual reversal of previous voluntary supply cuts. The OPEC Secretariat cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories, as the basis for the accelerated production hike. The move aims to balance market supply amid rising summer demand and recent geopolitical tensions that had briefly elevated oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's approach to hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup reveals a notable exception to its "America First" agenda, embracing global cooperation and international visitors for the major sporting event. The article details how President Trump has personally championed the tournament, offering guarantees for visa-free entry for athletes and fans, a stark contrast to his administration's otherwise restrictive immigration policies. This has involved close coordination with FIFA and Democratic-led host cities, which are set to receive federal funding for security despite other political conflicts. The preparations highlight a pragmatic shift when a high-profile, globally celebrated event is at stake.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Reverend William Barber and his revived Poor People's Campaign, a national "fusion movement" using nonviolent moral protest to challenge systemic poverty and injustice. It details a recent "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C., where a diverse group of activists demonstrated against proposed budget cuts to healthcare and food assistance, which Barber terms "policy murder." The movement draws on a tradition of religious protest, framing the fight for economic justice as a sacred obligation to confront a political theology that harms the poor. The piece explores whether this strategy of moral witness can effectively counter the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loan data into its credit scoring models, a change that will impact millions of consumers. For users of services like Affirm and Klarna, this means that their payment history on these short-term loans could now help or hurt their credit scores. Experts suggest that responsible users who make timely payments may see a benefit, potentially using it as a tool to build credit. However, the change could negatively affect those who are frequently late or accumulate too much debt, particularly younger and lower-income borrowers who are heavy users of BNPL services.

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have potential as a cancer-fighting agent. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug could help combat tumors by strengthening the immune system's dendritic cells. These crucial anti-tumor cells often become depleted as cancer progresses, and the study indicates that sildenafil could help reverse this process and restore their function. The discovery is being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy, opening a new avenue for cancer treatment research.</p>

          <p>The Pasadena community came together to support Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale street vending business after she became fearful following a recent immigration raid in the area. After a community activist shared his story on social media, hundreds of customers lined up to buy out his entire stock, raising over $1,500 for his family. The event highlights the fear within immigrant communities amid federal crackdowns and the trend of American-born children stepping up to help their parents.

Experts note that institutions are not betting on hype but on Ethereum's utility as a stable, secure, and dependable network for transactions and tokenized assets.

This is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14,000 tonnes. The solar panels are designed to rise and fall with the tide, and their proximity to the water's cooling effect is reported to increase their energy generation efficiency by 5 to 8 percent, marking a breakthrough for the industry.</p>
