          <h2>Trump Considers Tax Hike on Wealthy to Protect Medicaid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:15:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent, in an effort to help protect Medicaid. This move would partially reverse tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the top bracket rate to 37 percent. Trump's proposal aims to offset the cost of tax cuts and alleviate concerns about cutting Medicaid benefits to fund tax reductions for the wealthy. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newspapers are reporting on a new trade deal between the US and the UK, with the Daily Mail emphasizing it was 'made by Brexit' to save the British car industry from American tariffs. The Financial Times notes it's the first US trade deal since the start of the 'Trump war,' securing concessions on car and steel exports but not reversing a 10% levy on most goods. The Times highlights the deal's 'historic' nature, saving jobs while benefiting American beef and ethanol. The Daily Telegraph reports the US can object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim the government disputes. The Metro humorously declares 'the future's orange!' alongside a picture of President Trump.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:10:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a significant shift from its protectionist trade policies. This potential deal comes as the U.S. is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024. Experts suggest that a trade agreement could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding access to global markets. However, some analysts caution that zero tariffs might impact India's domestic manufacturing ambitions, although the overall effect on sectors like steel, pharmaceuticals, and auto parts may be limited.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department arrested 44-year-old Samuel Patrick Groft for allegedly cutting down 13 trees in downtown Los Angeles over seven days, causing over $170,000 in damages. The bizarre crime spree, initially unnoticed, gained attention after images of downed trees circulated on social media. Tips from the public, including surveillance footage, helped police track down Groft, who was found with a spray-painted electric chainsaw. Groft has pleaded not guilty to felony vandalism charges, and his motive remains unclear, although he reportedly claimed to love trees and be an arborist upon his arrest.</p>

The company's comparable sales increased 5% year over year in the first five weeks of the second quarter, driven by traffic and pricing growth. While the company raised its commodity cost inflation outlook for the year, analysts believe Texas Roadhouse's brand strength and value proposition will help it navigate economic uncertainties.

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing mounting pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts, with county and club teams advocating for the choice between skorts and shorts. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams has criticized the rule as 'sexist' and urges the association to 'be transformational' by allowing players to choose their preferred attire. A recent Gaelic Players Association survey indicated that 70% of players experience discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue.</p>
