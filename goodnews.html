          <p>Actor David Boreanaz recently shared a humorous anecdote about his first meeting with the late Betty White on the set of the TV show "Bones." He recalled how White, after greeting his co-star Emily Deschanel politely, turned to him and made a surprisingly explicit and funny proposition. The story highlights White's well-known "potty mouth" and penchant for comedic shock value, which co-stars confirmed was a legendary part of her personality. White, a beloved icon, passed away in 2021 just shy of her 100th birthday.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests President Trump's recent summits with Ukrainian and European leaders have increased the possibility of ending the war with Russia, despite significant challenges. The author notes that while the diplomatic atmosphere was positive, Russia continues its daily attacks, signaling disrespect for the peace process. The article highlights that Russia's supposed concessions, like security guarantees, are complex and may be a tactic to buy time. For the peace effort to succeed, the author argues Trump must reinforce U.S. support for Ukraine and leverage strategic ambiguity to pressure Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major food chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new beverage offerings to drive sales, particularly among Gen Z consumers. These younger customers show a strong preference for customized, cold, and flavorful drinks, shifting beverage purchases from a meal add-on to a primary reason for visiting. In response, companies are expanding menus with items like protein-infused cold foam, cereal-flavored lattes, and "dirty sodas." This strategy is seen as crucial for reversing sales slumps in a challenging economic environment where consumers are becoming more price-sensitive.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has acknowledged it is evaluating several new products after reports emerged that the company is developing a new, more powerful AI chip for the Chinese market, tentatively named the B30A. This development comes after the U.S. government halted sales of advanced chips to China over national security concerns but later allowed sales with a 15% revenue cut going to the government. President Trump has indicated he might approve a "somewhat enhanced" but still scaled-down version of Nvidia's advanced Blackwell chip for China. The company stated any new offerings would have full government approval.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that Intel will be required to give the government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act. This policy shift converts what was previously a grant under the Biden administration into an equity investment for the American public. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to reshore U.S. manufacturing and ensure the government benefits from its financial support to key industries. The announcement comes as Intel slows construction on its Ohio factory complex and after it secured a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has announced its intention to release documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which it is set to receive from the Department of Justice following a subpoena. The committee plans to review the files and redact sensitive information, such as victim identities, before making them public. This move comes after an internal DOJ review found no "client list," a finding that angered some Trump supporters and led to calls for greater transparency. Committee Chairman James Comer stated the release is intended to provide the American people with more information about the matter.</p>

          <p>Following a series of meetings at the White House, President Trump is personally working to arrange a face-to-face meeting between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's tariffs will largely offset weaker revenue from his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency anticipates "meaningful" income from the broad tariffs, which will help balance the fiscal impact of the new law that is projected to increase the federal deficit. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to political inability to control spending. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the FTC, the operation generated nearly $64 million in resale revenue, with over $1.2 million coming from Swift's tour alone.
