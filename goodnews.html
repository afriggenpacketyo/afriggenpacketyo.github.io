          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the company at $3.3 billion. The pricing exceeded the expected range, indicating strong investor demand despite the company reporting significant financial losses in recent years. The successful IPO is seen as a key test for the crypto market's vitality, especially following a recent consolidation in the prices of major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.

          <p>In his first month as CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, David Ellison has initiated an aggressive strategy to reshape the media company. He secured a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal to make Paramount+ the exclusive U.S. home for UFC, greenlit a film based on the 'Call of Duty' video game franchise, and is reportedly preparing an offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. These swift, high-investment moves signal a long-term strategy focused on acquiring high-value content and franchises to revitalize the company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) soars, financial experts are cautioning investors against several common pitfalls that can undermine returns. These mistakes include not understanding the underlying assets of a fund, leading to unintended risk exposure, and 'chasing performance' by investing in trendy, thematic ETFs after they have already rallied. Another key error is trading ETFs too frequently like stocks, which can erode the benefits of their low-cost and tax-efficient structure through poor timing. (not investment advice)</p>
