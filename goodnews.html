          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced a program offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who voluntarily depart the United States for their countries of origin. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest and most cost-effective way for immigrants to leave the U.S. to avoid arrest. Participants must use the CBP Home app and will receive the stipend upon confirmed arrival in their home country, while also being deprioritized for detention and removal during their departure process. The administration argues that this program is a more dignified and economical approach compared to forced deportations.</p>

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to restore Cadillac to its former glory as a leading American luxury car brand. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from other GM brands, focusing on all-electric vehicles, and emphasizing value over volume. While challenges remain, particularly in China, Cadillac has seen recent success in North America, with increased sales and lower incentives. The company is also relaunching the bespoke, all-electric Celestiq, aiming to create a new business model focused on both high-end, hand-built vehicles and mass-produced models.</p>

          <p>Representative Hank Johnson sparked controversy by drawing parallels to the Holocaust while criticizing the deportation of immigrants and the arrest of a Milwaukee judge. Johnson paraphrased Martin Niem√∂ller's confession, substituting groups targeted by the Nazis with Latinos, undocumented immigrants, and student protesters.
