          <p>Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Scholten revealed that she was on a suspected killer's target list following a fatal shooting in Minnesota, expressing shock and concern. Scholten emphasized the need for answers from the FBI and Capitol Police regarding why she was targeted, as well as the importance of bipartisan condemnation of political violence. Despite postponing a town hall meeting due to safety concerns, she affirmed her determination to continue her work and not be intimidated by such threats, characterizing them as "true domestic terrorism". Scholten also criticized Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee for his insensitive social media posts about the shooting, demanding an apology and the removal of the posts. The congresswoman stated she will remain committed to serving her constituents despite the dangers, and that she will not be intimidated. The event prompted a reaction from fellow legislators and underscores the current dangers facing lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, has voiced concern over Iranian state television urging citizens to delete the messaging app, claiming it's used by Israel to target individuals. Meta refuted these claims, emphasizing that WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring privacy between sender and recipient. The company also stated it does not track precise location data or provide bulk information to governments, further disputing the Iranian government's accusations. This warning from Iran comes amid escalating conflict with Israel and increased internet restrictions within the country, limiting public access to information. Meta has faced similar targeting by Iran's government during times of unrest, and the company remains committed to transparency and user privacy.</p>

          <p>The film ‚ÄúTrans Los Angeles‚Äù by director Kase Pe√±a portrays the diverse experiences of transgender individuals in Los Angeles through three vignettes. Inspired by the lack of authentic representation, Pe√±a drew from her personal experiences and stories from the trans community to create the film. The segments explore themes such as ICE raids, spirituality, sex work, and romantic relationships, highlighting both the struggles and the beauty of being human in L.A. The director intentionally cast transmasculine actor Jordan Gonzalez to play a cisgender role in one of the segments, seeking to break industry typecasting. Ultimately, the film seeks to provide a unique perspective on the trans experience, emphasizing the freedom to be oneself.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, a trend that could advance the clean energy transition and potentially reduce a surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. According to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), China has 90 former coal mines operating as solar-power facilities, with additional projects in the planning stages. These projects could help address land-utilization issues, as many coal mines have closed since 2010. Such projects are symbolic of a just energy transition, turning "abandoning" into "rebuilding."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with on passport applications and to select "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. This decision expands on an earlier ruling and comes after a lawsuit filed by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs who claimed the policy was discriminatory. The judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case, as the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the new passport policy.</p>

          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting course after building only a fraction of the originally planned barrier. The decision comes after state lawmakers approved a new budget that does not include continued funding for the project. Abbott's office stated that renewed federal assets in Texas allowed the state to adjust aspects of state-funded border security efforts, citing President Trump's efforts to curb immigration. The state has completed 65 miles of border wall since construction began, and funds previously allocated for the wall will allow work on it to continue through 2026.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve officials are expected to maintain current interest rates at this week's policy meeting, while providing updated economic forecasts amidst geopolitical uncertainties. The meeting will offer insights into the Fed's outlook on future rate cuts, inflation trends, and potential reactions to the White House's push for easier monetary policy. Investors will closely monitor the committee's "dot plot" grid of individual members' rate expectations for indications of future policy direction. The meeting comes amid a complex backdrop of trade tensions, the Israel-Iran conflict, and pressure from the Trump administration (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill requires full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, granting authority to the Treasury Secretary. The GENIUS Act now heads to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with the House's version of a stablecoin bill. The passage of this act is considered a major legislative win for the crypto industry, setting guardrails for the industry (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Vice President Vance Defends Trump's Handling of Iran</h2>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Donald Trump's handling of Iran in a lengthy post on X, amid criticism from some conservatives about potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and that he has encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal to prevent uranium enrichment. He stated that the president may take further action to end Iranian enrichment, and that the decision ultimately belongs to him. These comments come as some of Trump's supporters, such as Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, have spoken out against U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>
