          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called on his party to prepare for a potential general election in 2027. Farage predicts a significant rift within the Labour Party, suggesting it will descend into civil war and lead to an early election, a moment he believes Reform UK must be ready to capitalize on. During a party conference, he outlined key policy goals, including welfare cuts and stricter immigration controls, while emphasizing the party's growing momentum and readiness for government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that will allow the U.S. to impose sanctions on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure aims to deter nations from using Americans as political leverage and could include travel restrictions. The move is supported by families of past detainees, including that of Robert Levinson, who died in Iranian custody. The order follows several high-profile prisoner swaps with countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs, CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Home Depot as a prime stock to buy. He argues that the disappointing economic data will likely lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which would in turn lower mortgage rates and stimulate the housing market. Cramer believes that a drop in 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 6.5% could trigger a significant surge in housing-related stocks, with Home Depot positioned to be a primary beneficiary of increased home improvement activity.

          <p>The heirs of Robert Graetz, a Jewish art collector deported by the Nazis in 1942, are seeking the restitution of "A Young Girl," a painting by German expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker. The artwork has been in the possession of the Hamburger Kunsthalle museum since 1958, when it was donated by the widow of a Nazi party member and art collector. The case has been brought before Germany's Advisory Commission, which handles disputes over Nazi-looted art, just before the commission is set to be replaced by new arbitration tribunals. The family is optimistic, citing a previous successful restitution case.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, ten-year compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $975 billion. The plan consists of 12 tranches of shares tied to extremely ambitious market capitalization and operational milestones, such as reaching an $8.5 trillion valuation and delivering one million humanoid robots. This proposal follows a Delaware court's decision to void his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. If approved, the plan would also increase Musk's voting power, which he has publicly requested to maintain his focus on the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial experts advise investors to consider defensive strategies to protect their portfolio gains. The weak August jobs report has increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, but it also signals potential economic trouble ahead. Analysts suggest that many portfolios are overly concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, which now constitute nearly 40% of the S&P 500 index. They recommend re-evaluating this exposure and considering a shift towards value and defensive stocks that have not participated as much in the recent market rally, thereby broadening diversification.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion, the third-largest prize in U.S. history, ahead of the next drawing. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, currently valued at about 45% of the total jackpot. Regardless of the choice, a mandatory 24% federal tax is withheld upfront, with the winner likely owing more at tax time due to being in the top 37% bracket. State taxes also vary significantly, with eight states imposing no tax on lottery winnings, greatly affecting the final take-home amount for the potential winner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Snowy Day and Other Stories," the first English-translated collection of fiction by acclaimed South Korean film director Lee Chang-dong. The reviewer praises Lee's ability to evoke feeling and atmosphere through powerful imagery, a skill evident in his later film work like "Burning." The stories, written early in his career during the repressive Chun Doo-hwan dictatorship, are described as capturing the era's paranoia and harshness without resorting to direct explanation. Instead, Lee uses cinematic techniques on the page, employing light, darkness, and visual distortion to communicate the complex personal and political struggles of his characters.</p>

          <p>Along the coast of India, conservation efforts are helping to protect the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle population during their nesting season. Volunteers and activists carefully collect eggs from nests on the beach to incubate them in protected hatcheries, shielding them from predators and poachers. After hatching, the baby turtles are released onto the sand to make their crucial first crawl into the Arabian Sea. During this vulnerable moment, conservationists stand guard to ward off threats like crabs and birds, ensuring as many hatchlings as possible can begin their life in the ocean.</p>
