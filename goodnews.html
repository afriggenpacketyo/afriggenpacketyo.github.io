          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed subdued figures in April as consumer spending slowed, providing mixed signals for the economy. This development has led the Federal Reserve to maintain its hold on interest rate cuts, awaiting more clarity regarding President Trump's policies. The central bank aims to ensure that any adjustments to monetary policy align with the evolving economic landscape and fiscal strategies. The Fed is closely monitoring economic indicators to make informed decisions regarding future interest rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Treasury has announced the sale of its final shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of taxpayer ownership nearly two decades after the bank's bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The government spent ¬£45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), now part of NatWest Group, to prevent its collapse, which would have devastated the UK economy. While the government incurred a loss of ¬£10 billion on the investment, officials emphasize that the bailout was a necessary rescue to stabilize the economy, preventing widespread financial catastrophe. The sale signifies a symbolic end to a dramatic chapter in British banking history, raising questions about the safety and resilience of banks in the face of modern threats such as cyber attacks.</p>

          <p>As Poland prepares for a presidential runoff between Rafal Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki, Polish voters in Germany are showing a strong preference for Trzaskowski. The first election round revealed that Poles in Germany favor the liberal, pro-European Trzaskowski more than their counterparts in Poland, while the nationalist Nawrocki receives significantly less support. A surprising number of voters in Germany also backed the far-right Slawomir Mentzen, indicating a wariness of the traditional two-party system. The election highlights the differing political views of Poles living abroad and the factors influencing their choices, including a desire for new leadership and a rejection of the established political order.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri topped the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix as McLaren demonstrated strong pace in Barcelona. The talking point of the weekend is the new front-wing flexibility test introduced by the FIA, aimed at limiting teams' ability to use flexing wings to control aerodynamic performance. Red Bull and Ferrari hope the tougher restrictions will boost their competitiveness, while McLaren believes it will have minimal impact on their performance. Teams have long utilized front-wing flexibility to enhance speed on straights while maintaining downforce in corners, a technique that has proven useful in tuning cars between high- and low-speed cornering performance.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid on June 1, after Liverpool accepted a fee to release the defender early from his contract. The agreed fee, reportedly around 10 million euros, allows the 26-year-old to play in the Club World Cup for Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold, who had previously confirmed his departure from Liverpool this summer, has signed a six-year deal with a 1 billion euro buy-out clause.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down high-interest credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. By taking these actions, individuals can mitigate the impact of high borrowing costs and position themselves for better financial outcomes. These strategies aim to empower consumers to take control of their financial situations rather than waiting for external economic changes. (not investment advice)</p>
