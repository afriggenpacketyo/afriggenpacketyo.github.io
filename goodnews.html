        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a crushing defeat in the 2024 elections, the Democratic Party is undergoing a period of self-reflection and reimagining, with differing factions vying for influence. Ezra Klein's book, "Abundance," which advocates for focusing on increasing the supply of essential resources, has become a focal point of contention. While some Democrats embrace the "Abundance Agenda" as a path forward, anti-corporate populists view it as a threat to their rising influence within the party. This faction prefers to concentrate on addressing concentrated power and corporate influence, arguing that these factors hinder progress and exacerbate inequality. The debate highlights fundamental disagreements about the core issues facing the Democratic Party and the best strategies for future success.</p>

          <p>Nine U.S. veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a week-long psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their combat-related trauma. The retreat involved traditional healers administering psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT in ceremonies intended to help the veterans revisit and process traumatic experiences. While eight of the veterans reported improved symptoms and life-changing experiences, one veteran experienced a decline in mental health and returned to antidepressant medication. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials to study the potential of psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin for treating PTSD, depression, and addiction, while also advising against self-medication with these substances.</p>
