          <p>Shohei Ohtani contributed an RBI single in the Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Nationals, marking his return to form after a brief RBI drought. The game saw Miguel Rojas shine with a two-run homer, while Ohtani displayed no lingering effects from a previous hit by a fastball. Manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension during the game due to a prior incident, and he confirmed that Ohtani is still scheduled to pitch against Washington. The article also covers other MLB action involving Japanese players, including Tomoyuki Sugano and Yusei Kikuchi, in their respective games.</p>

This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The goal is to use genomics and AI to revolutionize prevention, provide faster diagnoses, and offer early warnings for diseases. The screening will involve sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples, expanding the current heel prick test that checks for nine serious conditions.</p>
