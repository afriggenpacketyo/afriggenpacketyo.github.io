The unit conducts approximately 700 child sexual abuse investigations annually, safeguarding hundreds of children, and executes 15 to 20 search warrants weekly across Scotland. Offenders come from various professional backgrounds, and the unit prioritizes cases based on the risk to children, emphasizing the relentless nature of this crime.

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold from companies with a surplus. This system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, although companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers through price increases.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only for being one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its high level of insider selling. In the IPO, existing shareholders are selling 60% of the shares, which is unusually high for a tech IPO, similar to Facebook's 2012 IPO. This may be due to the extended period of meager returns for venture capital firms and a strong desire by early investors to gain liquidity. Circle is profitable and has significant cash reserves, making the high level of insider selling a peculiar aspect of the IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing the issue of violent low-frequency vibrations at high speeds. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) discovered that track irregularities and electromagnetic resonance could cause "extremely unpleasant" bumps in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. They developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort. This research casts new light on the challenges faced by Elon Musk‚Äôs Hyperloop concept.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard, including barring international students and freezing grants, have fostered a sense of unity on campus. Students and faculty are setting aside differences over issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to defend the university. A former Jewish leader criticized the Trump administration's narrative, and a pro-Palestinian demonstrator joined in support. The university is preparing for commencement amidst this atmosphere of relative unity, contrasting with the discord seen at other institutions.</p>
