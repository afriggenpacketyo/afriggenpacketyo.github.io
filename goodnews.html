          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high, even after the Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut earlier in the week. This counterintuitive market reaction suggests investors are weighing broader economic factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, including signs of resilient economic growth and persistent inflation. A recent report showing fewer jobless claims has eased some concerns about a potential labor market slowdown. Investors are now looking ahead to the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, for further direction on the economy's trajectory.

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly addressed reports about Tom Brady's involvement in the team's game planning, clarifying the minority owner's role. Following a sideline report suggesting frequent collaboration, Kelly explained that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource for general football strategy and insights, Brady is not involved in the weekly preparation of game plans. Raiders coach Pete Carroll also dismissed the report as inaccurate, stating his conversations with Brady are more general. The NFL confirmed that there are no policies prohibiting an owner from being in the coaches' booth during a game.</p>

          <p>The iconic towers of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris have officially reopened to the public, marking a major milestone in the restoration efforts following the 2019 fire. French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the restored towers, allowing visitors once again to climb the 424 stairs for panoramic views of the city. The cathedral itself reopened in December 2024 and has since attracted nearly 30,000 visitors daily. The successful and timely restoration, which cost nearly $1 billion, is seen as a significant achievement for Macron, fulfilling his five-year promise to rebuild the historic landmark.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which creates a new tax deduction for service workers. The provision allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, though the benefit phases out for higher earners. Key details confirm that workers in certain professional fields like healthcare and legal services will not qualify. Additionally, the guidance specifies that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments.

          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowers have several increasingly affordable options for accessing funds. Among the cheapest methods are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have an average rate of 8.05% and could become cheaper with future cuts due to their variable rates. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate and are also a cost-effective choice. While no longer in the single digits, personal loans remain a less expensive alternative to high-interest credit cards and do not require putting up a home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tribute to the late Robert Redford explores the actor and director's career, highlighting a recurring theme in his work: the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. From iconic roles in films like "Downhill Racer" and "The Candidate," Redford consistently portrayed characters whose athletic prowess or political success revealed a deeper moral ambiguity. The article argues that his nuanced performances and directorial choices reflected a profound distrust of easy wins and the superficiality of being seen as an icon. This perspective shaped a legacy that valued artistic integrity and truth over the simple celebration of success.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker traffic that was lost during recent years of drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking system for LNG carriers and are developing a new pipeline project to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus, freeing up canal slots for other vessels. These initiatives aim to address the decline in energy transits, which fell sharply as shipping companies opted for longer routes to avoid canal restrictions. The move comes as the canal forecasts a broader decline in freight volume due to shifting global trade patterns.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Western countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Australia, have announced plans to formally recognize Palestine as a state, signaling a significant shift in international policy. These announcements follow recent recognitions by Spain, Ireland, and Norway and come as the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly backed a resolution supporting a two-state solution. The moves have drawn strong criticism from Israeli officials, who argue it rewards terrorism. Despite the growing global consensus, full UN membership for Palestine remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council.</p>
