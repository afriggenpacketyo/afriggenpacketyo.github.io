          <p>Zijin Gold, the international unit of one of China's largest miners, has launched a significant Initial Public Offering in Hong Kong, aiming to raise approximately $3.2 billion. The offering is buoyed by a nearly 40% surge in gold prices this year, as global investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. The deal has already attracted substantial interest, with 29 cornerstone investors, including Singapore's GIC and BlackRock, subscribing to about half of the available shares. This strong investor confidence suggests the IPO is poised to be one of the most successful market debuts of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a scheduled call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump indicated that a deal regarding the U.S. operations of TikTok is close to being finalized. He stated that the popular video app's American counterpart will be owned by U.S. investors and that the government would receive a significant fee for facilitating the agreement. Trump also mentioned the possibility of extending the current trade truce with China, describing the existing terms as favorable. These comments suggest a potential de-escalation in economic tensions between the two global powers, pending the outcome of the leaders' direct conversation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 0.5%, a move that aligns with economists' expectations amid signs of cooling inflation. Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, marking its third straight monthly decline and the lowest level since November 2024. While headline inflation remains above the bank's 2% target, the central bank is maintaining a cautious stance, prioritizing stability over premature tightening in the face of global economic uncertainty. This strategy supports a gradual reflationary cycle rather than an aggressive policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants 2-1 in a tense game that tested their recently struggling bullpen. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5⅓ scoreless innings but issued a career-high six walks, forcing the relievers into a high-pressure situation. After the Giants scored a run in the seventh inning, the bullpen, including Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia, managed to execute crucial pitches to prevent further damage and preserve the lead. The victory extends the Dodgers' lead in the National League West division to three games, providing a much-needed confidence boost for their relief corps.</p>

          <p>A specialized train used by Network Rail to clear autumn leaves from UK railway tracks has been officially named 'Ctrl Alt Deleaf' following a public vote. The name, a pun on the computer command, won with 50% of over 1,300 votes, beating other shortlisted options like 'Pulp Friction' and 'The Autumn Avenger'. These trains play a crucial role in preventing delays caused by slippery rails, a common issue referred to as "leaves on the line." The naming contest has brought a lighthearted focus to a serious operational challenge, continuing a tradition of giving memorable names to important railway vehicles.</p>

The funding was frozen by the administration over allegations of campus antisemitism, illegal use of race in admissions, and other violations. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin suggested the administration's use of non-specific form letters for the mass terminations likely violated federal procedure. A preliminary injunction would reverse the funding cuts while the case proceeds, providing critical relief for numerous medical research projects on diseases like Parkinson's and cancer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is expected to give Asian central banks more flexibility to implement their own monetary easing policies. The move narrows the gap between U.S. and Asian bond yields, which could alleviate currency pressures and allow countries facing economic headwinds to lower their rates. While some nations like South Korea and Australia have already cut rates to counter trade strains, economists believe the Fed's signal of more reductions will likely lead to a more accommodative policy stance across the region. However, policy will vary due to differing domestic conditions, such as inflation and export performance. (not investment advice)</p>
