          <p>Levi Kelly, a tiny homes expert from southern Ohio, successfully constructed a highly compact, livable home measuring just 19.4 by 4 feet in his front yard for approximately $5,000. Utilizing an old utility trailer as a foundation and repurposed materials, he equipped the 22-square-foot structure with essentials like a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, and a solar-powered kitchen. Kelly, who documents unique Airbnbs, aimed to prove that functional living spaces can be created with minimal square footage, even if he wouldn't live in it full-time. His project highlights creative solutions for small-scale living and encourages others to embrace minimalism in housing design.</p>

          <p>Despite New Mexico's national praise for significant child care investments, activists face a "mission accomplished" problem as many families still struggle with access and providers await promised wage increases. Dedicated funding streams, while offering stability, can be vulnerable to diversions and create a false sense of resolution among policymakers. States like Montana and Connecticut are navigating similar challenges, with advocates emphasizing the need for sustained efforts beyond initial legislative victories. This article highlights that while progress is made, comprehensive solutions require continuous advocacy and a realistic assessment of ongoing needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage experts anticipate that this fall could present a significant refinancing opportunity for homeowners, particularly those with rates above 7%. Recent declines have brought 30-year fixed loan rates to around 6.5%, with further drops expected due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Homeowners with large loan balances or FHA loans stand to benefit most, as even modest rate reductions can lead to substantial annual savings. The article advises potential refinancers to prepare by checking credit reports, reviewing financial positions, and gathering necessary documentation to act swiftly. (not investment advice)</p>

This explanation mirrors her previous response to the right-hand bruise, though the White House later provided a more medical reason for that instance, citing soft-tissue irritation and aspirin use.
