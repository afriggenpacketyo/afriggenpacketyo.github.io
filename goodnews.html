        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.3 billion for the upcoming Wednesday drawing, with a cash value of approximately $589 million, after no tickets matched all winning numbers in Monday's $1.2 billion drawing. This marks the sixth time in the game's 33-year history that the top prize has surpassed the billion-dollar mark, highlighting the rarity and excitement surrounding such a large sum. The previous drawing saw nine tickets win $1 million by matching five white balls across several states, though none secured the grand prize. With no winner since May 31, anticipation is building for the next drawing, where tickets are available for $2 in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 00:26:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pickleball is seeing a significant surge in popularity in China, mirroring the U.S. craze, with online sales of equipment skyrocketing over six-fold this year to an average of $1.2 million monthly. This growth is attributed to a broader shift towards active lifestyles, social media influence, and a resurgence of racquet sports following Chinese tennis player Zheng Qinwen's Olympic gold. Unlike the U.S., China's urban density means private businesses are driving court development for profit, and the sport's ease of learning is appealing. Despite challenges like language barriers for foreign brands, the market is ripe for expansion, with many eager to be first movers.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer's creation of two new senior roles at No 10, including a chief economic adviser, is seen by some as an attempt to regain control of economic policy from the Treasury, with critics suggesting it undermines Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This shake-up comes amid a "tumultuous autumn" forecast for the government and a slide in Labour's poll ratings. Other prominent news includes Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's criticism of Starmer on immigration, calls by medical experts to ban e-cigarettes due to health concerns, and studies on stroke recovery aided by AI and the link between noisy roads and stroke risk.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox initiated an ambitious plan to build 35,000 lower-cost starter homes in five years, addressing the state's soaring housing prices and record-high median age for first-time homebuyers. Despite legislative incentives like low-interest construction loans, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. Housing experts suggest bolder zoning changes are needed, but lawmakers rejected such proposals. One developer, Jed Nilson, has successfully built starter homes under $400,000 by leveraging state aid and smaller plot sizes, offering a glimmer of hope for young couples like Miranda and Cole Potokar, who recently purchased one.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2026, advocating for "generational change in the party." The 78-year-old cited former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election as a factor in his decision, believing a younger successor could better address current political challenges, particularly those posed by former President Trump. Nadler, who chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as a manager for Trump's first impeachment, made the decision in December 2024. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a relentless fighter for justice and civil rights.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed for astronauts, tackling the critical challenge of laundry in space where water is an extremely limited resource. Developed by the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre, this cube-shaped device is slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase and weighs 12kg. It remarkably uses only 400ml of water per cycle to clean up to 800 grams of clothing, delivering water as an ultra-fine mist through ultrasonic atomization. Instead of traditional detergent, the machine utilizes ultraviolet light to generate ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes garments for up to five wears, marking a significant step for sustainable space living.</p>

This commanding performance sets up a historic all-Italian men's quarter-final against Lorenzo Musetti, who also advanced decisively.

          <p>Thousands of union members and community organizers across the Los Angeles region and the broader United States participated in marches, rallies, and picnics to celebrate Labor Day. These events also served as platforms to vocalize opposition to actions by the Trump administration, which participants contend are detrimental to unions and workers' rights, while disproportionately benefiting major corporations and the wealthy. Featured in the article are scenes from the Oxnard Labor Day Picnic and a protest in Wilmington, depicting families, agricultural workers, and speeches by figures like AFL-CIO President Elizabeth H.

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is advocating for improved accessibility within the Houses of Parliament, describing parts of the building as "inaccessible to me." She highlighted issues like heavy doors, difficult door handles, and the distance to accessible toilets, despite the Equalities Act being passed 15 years ago within the same complex. Tidball, who missed years of school due to surgeries, believes the composition of Parliament should reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. The House of Commons Modernisation Committee is addressing these concerns, with a report and plans for bigger changes due later this year.</p>

The inn has hosted presidents and royalty, surviving earthquakes and wildfires, and is maintained by dedicated teams ensuring its historic appearance.

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without a deportation order, just hours before flights were set to depart from Texas. The judge's intervention came after lawyers argued the expedited deportations would bypass legal protections for minors, potentially exposing them to abuse or persecution upon return. The Justice Department claimed the repatriations were requested by the Guatemalan government and families, but this was disputed. The ruling, deemed "extraordinary," ensures these children remain in U.S. custody under the Department of Health and Human Services for now.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs shattered previous records, collectively spending over £3 billion in the summer transfer window, significantly surpassing last summer's £1.96 billion outlay. Deadline day saw major deals, including Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move to Liverpool, pushing the total past the £3 billion mark. Liverpool set a new club record for spending in a single window at £415 million. This unprecedented expenditure by the Premier League dwarfs the combined spending of the other "big five" European leagues, leading some to suggest the Premier League is becoming a "behemoth" and other leagues are acting as feeders.
