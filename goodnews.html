          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced it is speeding up its production timeline for its new U.S. facilities by several quarters due to strong demand from American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer, which has committed $165 billion to U.S. manufacturing, reported record-high profits that surpassed estimates. CEO C.C. Wei acknowledged potential risks from U.S. tariff policies on consumer-related electronics but stated that customer behavior has not yet changed. The company aims to be a key partner in the U.S. semiconductor industry.</p>

          <h2>Airline Passenger Etiquette Questioned Over Bringing Aromatic Foods on Flights</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:16:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A discussion on a Reddit forum has ignited a debate about the etiquette of eating fragrant foods in the confined space of an airplane cabin. One user questioned whether it was inconsiderate to bring aromatic meals into economy class, prompting a wide range of responses from fellow travelers. While some strongly agreed that bringing smelly food is rude and compared it to microwaving fish in an office, others defended the practice, citing the need to eat during tight travel schedules or due to dietary restrictions. Travel experts generally advise passengers to be mindful of others and avoid bringing particularly pungent foods on board.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Propose Bill to Classify Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster for Federal Aid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation that would amend the Stafford Act to include extreme heat as a "major disaster," making affected communities eligible for federal FEMA assistance. The move follows a record-breaking heat dome in June and highlights that heat waves, despite being deadly, are not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster type. Proponents argue this would unlock crucial funding for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. However, the bill faces opposition, with some, including a former FEMA administrator, arguing that heat-related issues can already be addressed through existing hazard mitigation grants.</p>

          <p>A mother and her nine-year-old son were successfully rescued after being lost for over 24 hours in the Sierra Nevada forest, thanks to a series of notes she left for searchers. The pair became stranded after their vehicle got stuck and their GPS failed in a remote area. The mother, Tami, strategically placed handwritten notes under rocks, guiding a Calaveras County volunteer search and rescue team to their location. The notes provided directions and identified them, ultimately leading the crew directly to the unharmed mother and son, who had spent the night in their car.</p>

          <p>The city of Minot, North Dakota, is engaged in an ongoing battle against a booming population of Richardson's ground squirrels. The burrowing rodents, whose numbers may now exceed the city's human population, are causing extensive damage to lawns, sidewalks, and foundations. With few natural predators in urban areas, their numbers have exploded, prompting the city and private residents to employ trappers. However, officials acknowledge that eradication is impossible and the goal is simply to control the population, a task made difficult by the squirrels' rapid reproduction and the vastness of their habitat.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival's program is heavily influenced by contemporary global crises, with themes of power, conflict, and collapsing empires taking center stage. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a lineup of operas and plays that explore these struggles, from Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto" to a play based on Karl Kraus's "The Last Days of Mankind." The festival will also feature numerous Russian artists who have distanced themselves from the Putin regime, though it continues to face some controversy. The program aims to use the performing arts as a mirror to reflect on historical and current events.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections across the United Kingdom, a change that could be in place before the next general election. The move would enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers, representing the most significant expansion of the electorate since 1969. The proposal also includes other electoral reforms, such as allowing bank cards as voter ID and moving toward an automated voter registration system. The policy, a Labour party manifesto commitment, has been welcomed by student groups but criticized by Conservatives as "hopelessly confused."</p>

The club notes that Cisco has already achieved its $1 billion goal for AI infrastructure orders from major cloud customers, demonstrating its ability to compete in the fast-growing data center market. The ongoing shift to higher-margin subscription revenue, which now constitutes 56% of total revenue, is also seen as a key strength. With an undemanding valuation and a solid dividend yield, the club sees potential for the stock to re-rate higher. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers aim to observe the tissue's behavior in real-time to better understand space-related neurological changes and conditions like Alzheimer's.

From the original "Peter Pan's Flight" to modern lands like "Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge," this integration has made the Experiences division a major profit driver, out-earning the entertainment division that creates the content. The company plans to invest $60 billion in its parks over the next decade, with a heavy focus on IP-driven attractions like new "Avatar" and "Monsters Inc." areas, ensuring the cycle of content-to-experience continues to fuel the Disney flywheel.</p>
