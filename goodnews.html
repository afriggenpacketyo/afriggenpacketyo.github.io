          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within the Taklamakan Desert. This finding in the Xinjiang region suggests the area has the natural conditions necessary for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. The shrimp, also known as Artemia, are valuable in aquaculture as feed and also have uses in medicine and cosmetics. Researchers will now conduct laboratory studies to determine if this is a new species and to explore the potential for developing a local aquaculture industry.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech giant Alibaba experienced a substantial surge of nearly 19% in Hong Kong trading following a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The strong performance was primarily fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, driven by high demand for AI-related products. While the company's core e-commerce business saw revenue growth, profitability was impacted by heavy investment in the competitive "quick commerce" sector. The positive results reflect investor confidence in Alibaba's strategy of balancing AI investment with growth in its traditional business segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland's state-owned rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently abolished peak-time fares on its services, a move aimed at making train travel more affordable and attractive. The change, effective September 1st, will result in significant savings for commuters, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow becoming nearly 50% cheaper. This policy, which follows a previous successful pilot, is intended to encourage more people to switch from cars to public transport, thereby reducing carbon emissions. The government has reinstated the policy after finding its financial position had strengthened enough to support the initiative.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has advanced to the US Open quarter-finals with a convincing straight-sets victory over Jan-Lennard Struff. Despite his dominant performance, questions about the 38-year-old's physical fitness persist as he received medical attention for both his neck and forearm during the match. Djokovic is playing his first tournament since Wimbledon and has shown signs of fatigue and injury in previous rounds. Nevertheless, he became the oldest player in the Open era to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slams in a single season and will next face American player Taylor Fritz.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to display a wide array of advanced drones and autonomous systems at its upcoming military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Analysts suggest the showcase will highlight the People's Liberation Army's rapid progress in integrating AI-enabled technologies across air, land, and sea domains. While officials have confirmed that new unmanned systems will be publicly displayed for the first time, it is expected they will be shown in static displays rather than in motion due to security concerns. The parade aims to demonstrate China's growing capabilities in modern, multi-domain warfare.</p>

          <p>A new pilot scheme in Wales will offer young people aged 16 to 21 single bus tickets for just £1, with day passes capped at £3. The program, which will later extend to children aged five to 15, aims to make public transport more accessible for accessing education, employment, and leisure activities. To benefit from the reduced fares, eligible individuals must apply for a 'mytravelpass' through the Transport For Wales website. The Welsh government is investing £15 million into the scheme, which is intended to encourage sustainable travel habits among the youth.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Monday as investors processed new manufacturing data from China. A private survey indicated that factory activity expanded in August, beating expectations, while official data released earlier showed a fifth consecutive month of contraction. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw significant gains, lifted by a strong rally in Alibaba shares. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both declined. The varied market reactions reflect ongoing uncertainty about the health of China's economy and its broader impact on the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, expanding at its fastest pace since March. The RatingDog manufacturing PMI rose to 50.5, beating forecasts, largely due to a recovery in new orders and export business. This positive result contrasts with official government data, which showed a fifth straight month of contraction, highlighting a mixed economic picture. While the private survey suggests some resilience, particularly in external demand, analysts remain cautious due to persistent weak domestic demand and concerns about the sustainability of the rebound.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, signaling a renewed effort to normalize relations. This diplomatic engagement is viewed in the context of India's strained relationship with the United States, particularly following the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on Indian imports. While the meeting resulted in agreements to resume direct flights and simplify visas, significant challenges remain, including unresolved border disputes and a large trade deficit favoring China. India's outreach is part of its "strategic autonomy" policy, balancing relationships with competing global powers.</p>
