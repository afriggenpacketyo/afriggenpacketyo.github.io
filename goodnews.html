          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Expectations in April</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 02:28:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing in April was higher than anticipated, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, a ¬£1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of ¬£17.9 billion and marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase reflects the difference between government spending and tax income, highlighting potential challenges in managing the UK's finances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. According to James Butterfill, this rise is occurring despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, with which Bitcoin typically correlates. This divergence may be due to investors seeking alternative stores of value, with concerns over U.S. sovereign debt adding to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate mirrors economic fundamentals during bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgment implies that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets, reiterating that tariffs are an inappropriate tool for addressing trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng are poised for further gains, with analysts forecasting continued growth as the Chinese electric-vehicle maker introduces new models and progresses toward profitability. The company's Hong Kong shares jumped following strong earnings and an upbeat revenue forecast for the second quarter. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled due to robust sales, narrowing its net loss and improving its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by its strong sales momentum and upcoming model releases. (not investment advice)</p>
