          <p>Real Madrid has appointed Xabi Alonso, their former midfielder, as their new manager on a three-year deal, succeeding Carlo Ancelotti who will now coach Brazil. Alonso, who played 236 games for Real Madrid, recently led Bayer Leverkusen to a Bundesliga title without losing a single game, also securing the German Cup. His success at Leverkusen marks his first full season as a senior club manager, establishing him as one of the most promising managers in football. The appointment signifies a strategic move by Real Madrid to bring in a manager with a deep understanding of the club's culture and a proven track record of success.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is grappling with concerns about its aging leadership, highlighted by President Biden's cognitive issues and the recent deaths of several older House Democrats. This has sparked debate about the party's ability to connect with younger voters and balance experience with fresh perspectives, with tensions arising between younger members and the old guard. The article suggests the party needs to address the issue of aging leaders to revivify its ideas and approaches and elevate new voices. The debate comes as a 25-year-old recently elected as a vice chairman of the national party plans to spend millions to get more young blood into the party, and to support primary challengers against the party‚Äôs older incumbents, with an eye toward dismantling a ‚Äúculture of seniority politics.‚Äù</p>

          <p>The author contends that public lands, managed by the federal government on behalf of all Americans, are invaluable and should remain protected. The article traces the history of public land management, from early privatization efforts that led to ecological devastation to Theodore Roosevelt's conservation efforts. The piece emphasizes that public land designations do not seize private property but change management practices on existing federal lands. The author argues against selling off public lands, asserting that it would risk ecological destruction and that these lands hold the promise of a sustainable future, and that they are fundamentally American.</p>

          <p>Volunteers gathered at the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve to remove invasive black mustard plants, which crowd out native species crucial for the ecosystem's health. The effort, organized by Friends of the Los Angeles River, aims to restore the basin's meadows and improve carbon capture and runoff filtration. Volunteers focused on clearing areas around coast live oaks to protect them from fire hazards caused by the weed. The event drew increased participation since recent wildfires, reflecting a desire for tangible actions to help the community and prevent further environmental damage.</p>

          <p>This article addresses questions about inherited Roth IRAs, the SECURE Act's impact on distributions, and retirement planning strategies for those starting late. It clarifies that spouses inheriting IRAs from original owners can treat them as their own, but this doesn't apply to "doubly inherited" IRAs, which are subject to different rules. The article also advises individuals in their late 50s to maximize Social Security benefits, delay retirement, and seek fee-only financial planning to compensate for lost time in retirement savings (not investment advice). Reverse mortgages are discussed in the context of assisted living, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of repayment terms.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the decline of deep male friendships in his life, noting a broader trend of American men becoming worse at maintaining close connections. He explores the reasons behind this, including societal expectations, fear of appearing soft or needy, and the prioritization of romantic relationships and family. The article contrasts this with historical examples of open affection between men and examines how societal norms around masculinity have changed. He recounts his own journey of seeking self-improvement through physical fitness but ultimately realizing the importance of reconnecting with friends.</p>

The authors argue that the Defund the Police movement was a success because it made a fringe leftist position into the mainstream and it shifted public opinion. Through the organizing of Black movement‚Äôs Defund campaign, over $840m in direct cuts were made from US police departments and at least $160m in investments were made in community services.

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices under the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following his predecessor's dismissal. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should be lower than the target set by Prime Minister Ishiba. The survey further showed that 42.2 percent said the removal of the former farm minister should have come sooner. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet rose slightly, though disapproval remains higher.</p>
