          <p>This article provides an overview of the current market price for gold, which stands at $3,743.42 per ounce as of September 25, 2025. It details the various economic and geopolitical factors that cause fluctuations in the precious metal's value, such as supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. The piece also explains gold's traditional role as a safe-haven asset for investors during times of uncertainty, highlighting its historical ability to retain value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August, aligning with economists' expectations. The headline inflation rate saw a minor increase to 2.7%, while personal income and spending both rose slightly more than anticipated. These figures suggest that inflation is not accelerating unexpectedly, likely keeping the central bank on track to consider further interest rate reductions later in the year.

          <p>Actor Jason Bateman reflects on his difficult transition from a child star to an adult actor, revealing that his career nearly ended in his 20s due to a hard-partying lifestyle. He explains that after years of working intensely from a young age, he felt a need to "catch up" on missed experiences, which led him away from the industry and made his return a humbling struggle. Bateman credits his wife Amanda Anka's ultimatum and landing the role in "Arrested Development" with revitalizing his career and helping him achieve sobriety and later success as both an actor and director.</p>

This innovative technology captures wind energy at higher altitudes where winds are stronger and more consistent, delivering electricity back to the ground through reinforced cables, with mass production planned for 2026.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, is advancing in Congress with the goal of making Social Security's retirement options easier for Americans to understand. The proposed legislation would change key terms, renaming the "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and "full retirement age" to "standard benefit age" to better reflect the financial consequences of claiming at different times. The goal is to provide clearer language that helps individuals make more informed decisions about when to begin receiving their benefits for better long-term financial security.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act Signals Potential Federal Role in Easing Local Zoning Rules</h2>

          <p>A new bipartisan Senate bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, is being analyzed as a significant, if modest, step toward federal involvement in solving the US housing crisis. The article explains how restrictive local zoning laws often stifle housing development and how state-level interventions have had mixed success. The proposed federal act encourages the creation of model zoning codes and offers financial incentives to municipalities that increase their housing supply, potentially creating a framework for "Right-to-Build Zones" that could streamline construction in designated areas.</p>

          <p>The terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a rapper from the group Kneecap known as Mo Chara, has been thrown out by a London court due to a technical flaw. He was charged with supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah after allegedly displaying a flag at a concert, but the chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because it was not brought within the required six-month time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was politically motivated and an attempt to silence support for Gaza.</p>

This development comes as North Korea has continued to advance its weapons programs and strengthen ties with Russia and China. However, significant obstacles remain, as Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear status is non-negotiable, a position directly at odds with the U.S. administration's stated goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>

The company manufactures most of its U.S. trucks domestically, and the new import tax is expected to level the playing field against competitors who produce trucks more cheaply in countries like Mexico.

She reflects on how they navigate these fundamental disagreements, often by avoiding political discussions altogether on the advice of their marriage counselor. Ultimately, she concludes that despite the friction, their relationship endures because of shared humor and his deep acts of kindness, which form the foundation of their connection beyond divisive external issues.</p>

Over half of the firms reported exposure to AI via public markets, compared to only a quarter investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is attributed to more confidence in the valuations of public companies and the fact that many of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 are already heavily involved in AI development and implementation.

          <p>This article reflects on the enduring cultural impact of Judy Blume's 1975 novel "Forever..." on its 50th anniversary, recalling its significance as a rite of passage for generations of young women. The book was radical for its time, depicting teenage sexuality, contraception, and desire from a young woman's perspective in a realistic and non-judgmental way. Despite facing decades of controversy and book bans for its explicit content, the novel is remembered for validating the curiosity and experiences of teens and encouraging them to be protagonists in their own sexual narratives.</p>
