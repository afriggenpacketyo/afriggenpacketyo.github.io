        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy items to their menus in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. This trend is seen as a low-cost, high-return strategy to boost sales amid slower consumer spending, with brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell launching new spicy sauces and dishes. The rise of social media platforms like TikTok is fueling the trend, as spicy food challenges and taste-test videos generate significant online buzz. However, restaurants face the challenge of younger generations' rapidly changing tastes.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments to its presidential history exhibit within the "coming weeks." The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears that history was being altered to appease the president. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any political pressure, explaining the placard was removed because it did not meet the museum's display standards and blocked the view of other objects. The updated presentation will be integrated properly into the exhibit on the limits of presidential power.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix after executing a masterful one-stop strategy, successfully defending against a late-race charge from his teammate, Oscar Piastri. After a difficult start dropped him to fifth, Norris extended his first stint on the tires, which ultimately positioned him for the victory. Piastri, on a two-stop strategy with fresher tires, closed the gap in the final laps but was unable to overtake on the notoriously difficult track. The victory narrows the gap between the two title contenders to just nine points heading into Formula 1's summer break, with Mercedes' George Russell finishing third.</p>

The terminal, set to be JFK's largest, is part of a wider $19 billion airport overhaul and will be dedicated solely to international travelers. The first phase, including the main halls and 14 wide-body gates, is scheduled to open in mid-2026, ahead of the World Cup. The design emphasizes natural light and will feature its own resilient microgrid for power, aiming to modernize the major U.S. travel hub.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has publicly dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' social media trade request, characterizing it as typical "negotiation talk." Parsons, who is seeking a contract extension that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL, has expressed frustration with the negotiation process. Jones insisted that the standoff is a normal part of high-stakes contract discussions and that a framework for an agreement already exists from earlier talks. While teammates have voiced support for Parsons, Jones expressed confidence that the dispute will be resolved satisfactorily for all parties.</p>

          <h2>China's Advanced Aircraft Carrier 'Fujian' Appears to Conduct First Catapult Launch Drill</h2>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone for the vessel. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a position for take-off, suggesting a successful launch drill. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which is similar to that used by the U.S. Navy and allows for launching heavier and more varied aircraft. The successful test moves the carrier closer to its expected entry into service with the People's Liberation Army Navy this year.</p>

          <p>A new report has identified the top 10 U.S. cities for employment and earnings, with mid-sized metro areas like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin leading the list. The study, conducted by HR technology company Checkr, ranked the 100 largest cities based on factors including unemployment rate, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings challenge the traditional dominance of major coastal hubs like New York and Los Angeles, suggesting that the "geography of opportunity" is shifting. Cities in the Southeast and Midwest, such as Charlotte and Omaha, also ranked highly for their strong job markets and affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Divorce Attorneys Offer Advice on Protecting Finances During a Rocky Marriage</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers suggest two key ways for individuals to protect their finances if their marriage is facing difficulties and a prenuptial agreement is not in place. The first step is to become fully informed about all joint assets, liabilities, and accounts while still married, as access to information is easier. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which is a contract created after marriage that specifies how assets, such as a new business, would be divided in a divorce. While discussing a postnup can be difficult, attorneys advise that proactively addressing these financial matters can prevent greater conflict and insecurity later on.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests using specific calming phrases to help manage a child's tantrums by connecting with them rather than trying to control them. Instead of punitive language, the article recommends phrases that validate a child's feelings, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you," and "Your feelings make sense." This approach aims to make the child feel safe and understood, which helps their nervous system regulate more quickly. The core principle is to shift from a mindset of control to one of connection, fostering emotional security and trust.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests China is Reassessing Its Middle East Strategy, Recognizing Israel's Importance</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A strategic analysis suggests that China is recalibrating its approach to the Middle East, potentially shifting from its traditionally neutral stance to one that recognizes Israel's growing strategic and economic importance. This change is reportedly driven by recent regional conflicts that have exposed the weakness of allies like Iran and highlighted risks to China's energy and trade interests. Bilateral trade between China and Israel is growing, particularly in high-tech sectors. A more balanced Chinese policy could see Beijing act as a mediator, counterbalance Iranian influence, and enhance its own image as a responsible global power.</p>

          <p>The UK government has stated it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. The initiative, which could be operational within weeks, reportedly aims to allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to receive free care. This follows criticism from a Foreign Affairs Committee report that the government had previously declined to support such a medical evacuation scheme. A private charity, Project Pure Hope, has already brought three children to the UK and has welcomed the government's plan, offering its expertise.</p>

          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is gaining traction, encouraging individuals to achieve early retirement through aggressive saving, strategic investing, and intentional spending. The philosophy, popularized by books like "Your Money or Your Life," centers on saving and investing approximately 25 times one's annual expenses to live off a 4% annual withdrawal. Adherents focus on defining what is "enough" for a happy life, prioritizing freedom and time over material possessions. The movement emphasizes that frugality is a tool to buy freedom, allowing people to leave the traditional workforce decades earlier than planned. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, revealed in a podcast that he does not know his exact net worth and prefers not to focus on it. Instead, he concentrates on building a portfolio of investments and relationships that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to a professional team. Financial planners quoted in the article support this mindset, suggesting that focusing on tangible goals and cash flow is often more productive and rewarding than obsessing over a net worth figure. They advise that aligning financial decisions with personal values leads to a healthier relationship with money.</p>
