          <p>Peter Coker Jr. received a 40-month prison sentence, while his father, Peter Coker Sr., was sentenced to six months in jail followed by six months of home confinement for their involvement in a $100 million securities fraud. The scheme involved fraudulently inflating the share price of two companies, including Hometown International, which owned a small, money-losing deli. Coker Jr.'s lawyer cited his client's harsh experiences in a Thai prison and his severe cirrhosis of the liver as mitigating factors. Coker Jr. expressed remorse for his actions, acknowledging the impact on his parents and renouncing his U.S. citizenship, while Coker Sr. was ordered to pay a $500,000 fine and restitution.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee has suggested a revote for vice-chair elections, potentially endangering the positions of current vice chairs David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta due to concerns about the original balloting process. The recommendation follows a challenge by vice-chair candidate Kalyn Free, who alleged voting irregularities that unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta. Hogg claims the vote is tied to his reform efforts within the Democratic Party, while Kenyatta expressed frustration that Hogg is making the issue about himself. DNC Chair Ken Martin voiced disappointment over the procedural error in the February elections and thanked the officers for their service.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, the White House announced $600 billion in deals with the Saudi government and firms, but the actual details provided totaled around $283 billion. The largest agreement included a $142 billion defense sales deal and a $20 billion investment from DataVolt in U.S. infrastructure. Trump hailed Saudi Arabia's rapid development and criticized the Biden administration's efforts in the region, also advocating for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords. Despite the announcements, some projects were already underway before Trump took office, and economists doubt Saudi Arabia's capacity to invest $1 trillion as requested by Trump.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, but this projection could change based on future inflation rates. The COLA provides an annual inflation adjustment to Social Security beneficiaries, including retirees and disabled individuals. The adjustment is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.</p>

          <p>The stock market has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, but investors remain cautious due to ongoing trade war uncertainty. While stocks have risen and bond market volatility has subsided, the lack of clarity on final tariff levels leaves investors in a difficult position. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer. Despite the de-escalation of tariffs, concerns persist about the impact on consumer spending and corporate profits, with some analysts warning that the U.S. is not yet "out of the woods."</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of large tariffs on goods from every country, inflation slowed in April, prompting questions about the economy's trajectory. The Trump administration also lowered tariffs on China, leading to speculation about the end of a manufactured economic crisis. While tariffs reliably increase consumer prices, companies had stocked up on foreign goods in anticipation, delaying the impact on inflation. The risk of a severe economic crisis has fallen, but price hikes are still expected as companies exhaust their pre-trade war inventories, leading to potential disruptions in supply chains and inflationary cycles.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he will lift sanctions on Syria, providing an economic boost to the war-torn country. Trump is expected to meet with Syria‚Äôs new president, Ahmed al-Shara, in Saudi Arabia. The decision breaks the economic stranglehold on Syria and is seen as critical for regional stability. Trump said he made the decision after speaking with Turkey‚Äôs president and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs crown prince, with the latter pledging to increase investment in the United States. The move has been hailed as a victory for justice and a reaffirmation of Arab unity.</p>
