          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has achieved a milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists anticipate that this tool will enhance their ability to predict solar storms, which can disrupt Earth's communications and electrical grids. The VTF, still undergoing testing, has already demonstrated its potential, offering hope for mitigating the damaging effects of geomagnetic disturbances.
