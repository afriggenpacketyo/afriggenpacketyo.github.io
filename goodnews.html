          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, but with limitations on its use, allowing it as a second option, not a replacement for the current Spikevax vaccine. This new vaccine is approved for adults 65 and older, and for individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus. The decision comes after the Trump administration canceled funding for Moderna to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic flu viruses. The agency has also dropped its recommendation for all children to get the vaccinated but still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most adults for now.</p>

          <p>This article provides information about delaying Medicare enrollment and the potential penalties involved. Generally, if you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying enrollment also allows your husband to continue making contributions on your behalf to his health savings account. Medicare itself suggests reaching out to the employer‚Äôs benefits department to confirm you are appropriately covered and can delay your application. (not investment advice)</p>
