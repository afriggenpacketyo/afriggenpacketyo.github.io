          <p>According to a new Nielsen report, streaming services have surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV for the first time. In May, streaming accounted for 44.8% of total TV viewership, while broadcast and cable combined represented 44.2%. The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV, the rise of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies towards streaming-centric consumers. As traditional media companies transform into streaming-first entities, platforms like Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock complement linear TV, contributing to the ongoing shift in viewership habits. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill was led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, who emphasized that nearly 99% of abortions occur before 20 weeks, leaving only 1% of women in desperate circumstances. The new clause does not change any laws regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including time limits or the requirement for two doctors' approval. While the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children has criticized the move, abortion providers and MPs supported the amendment. </p>

The decision follows a statement from federal health officials that they would work with the food industry to voluntarily phase out the use of petroleum-based food dyes by the end of next year, amid concerns about potential negative effects on children's behavior and mental health.
