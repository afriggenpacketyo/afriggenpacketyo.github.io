          <p>Thirty-year-old tech billionaire Lucy Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and CEO of Passes, adheres to an intense daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, back-to-back gym sessions, and often no designated lunch breaks. Despite her substantial wealth, Guo emphasizes a relentless work ethic, asserting that her life hasn't significantly changed since becoming a billionaire and that she continues to work exceptionally long days. She attributes her high productivity to optimizing her time by consciously avoiding common distractions such as "doom scrolling" on social media, suggesting that many individuals could achieve better work-life balance by eliminating similar time-wasting activities. Guo's demanding approach, which echoes Silicon Valley's intense work culture, has sparked considerable debate among other entrepreneurs regarding its long-term sustainability and whether such extreme hours are truly necessary to achieve significant professional success.</p>

          <h2>Kilauea Volcano Erupts Again, Marking 31st Event Since December</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 01:37:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted again, spewing an arc of lava 100 feet into the air across a section of its summit crater floor, marking its 31st such display since December. This latest eruption is contained entirely within the Halemaumau Crater, posing no immediate threat to nearby homes, and offers spectacular views for lucky residents and visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously feeding a lower chamber, building pressure until it forces out older, degassed magma, akin to a shaken champagne bottle. This pattern of repeated lava fountains is the fourth in 200 years for Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and while the current eruption's end or future changes remain uncertain, it continues to be a powerful natural spectacle.</p>

          <p>Mission Viejo secured a hard-fought 7-3 victory over Santa Margarita in a defensive high school football opener, with the game's only touchdown coming late in the third quarter. Ohio State commit Luke Fahey, Mission Viejo's quarterback, delivered a crucial 33-yard touchdown pass to Jack Junker, breaking a 3-0 deficit after a strategic punt by Isaiah Murgia pinned Santa Margarita deep. The game, characterized by intense defensive play and constant pressure on both quarterbacks, saw Mission Viejo's defense praised by coach Chad Johnson for their "phenomenal job" in shutting down the opposition. This outcome, alongside other surprising Trinity League results, suggests a challenging and competitive start for some of the league's powerful teams early in the season, highlighting the importance of strong defensive performances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and 30 other "sanctuary" jurisdictions due to their policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration efforts. U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended a preliminary injunction, deeming the administration's executive orders and related actions an unconstitutional "coercive threat" that sought to compel state and local governments. The ruling protects billions of dollars at risk for these cities and counties, which had initiated legal action over the threatened funding cuts. The Trump administration, which has appealed an earlier injunction and previously published a list of "sanctuary jurisdictions," continues its efforts to pressure these communities as it seeks to remove millions of undocumented individuals from the country.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been released from federal custody after months of detention, marking his first freedom since March. Garcia, originally from El Salvador and married to an American citizen, was deported under a controversial 18th-century law despite a 2019 immigration judge's order granting him protection from persecution by local gangs. After his eventual return to the US in June, he faced criminal charges of conspiring to transport illegal immigrants, which his lawyers strongly deny. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem criticized his release, calling it a "new low" by an "activist liberal judge" and reiterating claims, denied by his lawyers, that Garcia was an MS-13 gang member, underscoring the ongoing political and legal battle over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Award-winning HIV scientist Shan Liang, formerly a tenured associate professor at the Washington University School of Medicine, has relocated to Shenzhen, China, to take on a full-time role at the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART). He will now head SMART's Institute of Human Immunology, where he will continue his dedicated research into the mechanisms of immunobiology of HIV infection and the development of strategies for a functional cure. Shan's studies are highly regarded for having discovered new mechanisms by which HIV kills target cells, which is considered an important foundation for the development of new generation drugs to combat the virus. His move underscores China's strategic efforts to attract top scientific talent and significantly bolster its research capabilities in critical medical fields.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Bans Raw Rare Earth Exports, Boosting Domestic Processing</h2>

          <p>Malaysia has banned the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, signaling its intent to develop robust downstream industries and position itself as a significant, non-Chinese source for these critical minerals. This strategic move comes as the United States actively seeks to diversify its supply chains away from China, which currently dominates the global supply of rare earths. The Malaysian government aims to attract foreign investment into its rare earth sector, with a condition that projects involve local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities provide it with a crucial head start in integrating into global supply chains, positioning the nation to exercise its "geoeconomic agency" and capitalize on the growing international demand for diversified rare earth sources.

          <h2>Hong Kong Overtakes US as Preferred IPO Venue for Chinese Companies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 22:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong has officially surpassed the United States as the leading initial public offering (IPO) venue for mainland Chinese companies, marking a significant milestone for the city's capital market after a decade of focusing on growth from its larger hinterland. In the first eight months of 2025, a total of 46 Chinese companies successfully raised a combined US$16.5 billion via IPOs on the Hong Kong stock exchange, significantly outperforming the 16 listings by Chinese companies in the US, which collectively raked in a mere US$740.9 million. This notable shift is primarily driven by Hong Kong's more active market, where new shares have jumped 19.4% on average in their trading debuts, and the ongoing US-China rivalry, which creates persistent delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the US. The trend reflects a broader movement of investment funds returning to Asia amid geopolitical uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>
