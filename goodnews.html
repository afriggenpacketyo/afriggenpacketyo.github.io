          <p>Preliminary CDC data indicates a significant and sustained drop in U.S. drug overdose deaths, reaching their lowest point since March 2020. States like West Virginia have seen fatal overdoses fall by nearly 42 percent, with major decreases also noted in California, Florida, and New York. Despite this positive trend, the Trump administration continues to frame fentanyl as a growing crisis to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and potential military action against cartels, an approach some addiction experts criticize as misguided.</p>

          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or reinforcing military conscription in response to a changing geopolitical climate. Germany is introducing a "new military service" model, starting with a mandatory questionnaire for young men, while France focuses on expanding its reservist forces. Nations like Sweden, Latvia, and Lithuania have recently reinstated conscription, and countries with long-standing service, such as Finland and Norway, continue their models, with some extending it to women to bolster their defense capabilities and personnel numbers.</p>

The agreement includes a £13 million loan fee and a £56.2 million purchase option for the 24-year-old striker. Jackson's opportunities at Chelsea have been limited following the arrival of new signings, and he has not featured for the club in their opening league games this season. The deal also reportedly includes a sell-on clause for Chelsea.</p>

          <p>A global movement to protect children online, exemplified by the UK's Online Safety Act and the proposed Kids Online Safety Act in the U.S., is fueling a new market for AI-powered safety technology. Companies like Yoti are developing advanced facial age-estimation systems to help platforms verify user ages, while phone manufacturer HMD Global has launched a smartphone with AI that blocks the creation and viewing of explicit content. This legislative push is forcing major tech platforms to adopt stricter age assurance measures, though it also raises privacy concerns among critics.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons described the last four months of contract stalemate with the Dallas Cowboys as the "hardest" of his life before his trade to the Green Bay Packers. Now the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, Parsons is embracing the fresh start and aims to build a legacy with the historic franchise. The Packers sent two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas to acquire Parsons, who they hope will provide the consistent pass rush they have been lacking.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the world's most isolated nations, North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This surge has made North Korea the second-largest volume buyer of Chinese bottled wine, trailing only Hong Kong. While the United Nations has imposed sanctions on luxury goods to North Korea since 2006, alcohol is not on the prohibited list, allowing trade in items like wine to continue with its primary trading partner.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in four sets, despite struggling with a lower back issue early in the match. The 38-year-old became the oldest man to reach the last 16 at the tournament since 1991 and tied Roger Federer for the most grand slam fourth-round appearances. After Norrie bravely leveled the match by winning a second-set tiebreak, Djokovic regained control with dominant serving and relentless pressure to secure the victory in his best performance of the tournament so far.</p>

The Vikings' dominance was exemplified by a touchdown where ten teammates collectively pushed Bonner into the end zone, showcasing the team's emphasis on winning through physical force, which ultimately proved too much for their opponents.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expanding the use of "expedited removal" to deport undocumented migrants detained anywhere in the country's interior without a court hearing. The ruling is a setback for the administration's goal of carrying out mass deportations, with Judge Jia Cobb arguing that the government's plan fails to provide adequate due process under the Fifth Amendment. Previously, this fast-track process was primarily used for migrants apprehended within 100 miles of the border who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.</p>
