          <p>Scientists at the Field Museum of Chicago have uncovered new details about the Archaeopteryx fossil, revealing previously unknown features of early bird evolution. Using UV light and CT scans, researchers identified soft tissues indicating the presence of tertials, specialized feathers crucial for flight, and mobile fingers for climbing. The fossil suggests Archaeopteryx spent considerable time on the ground and had limited flight capability. These findings contribute to understanding the transition from dinosaurs to birds and the evolution of flight.</p>

Preliminary results from recent elections indicate that allies of both Marcos and Duterte are poised to claim Senate seats, which could shield Duterte from conviction and preserve her eligibility to run in the future.</p>

The BBC reports that Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the changes would protect "media plurality" while helping publishers "raise vital funding".
