          <p>Amazon, Meta, and Prologis have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon concrete. Cement production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 8% globally. The alliance aims to use its collective purchasing power to create demand for sustainable alternatives, thereby encouraging producers to invest in expensive decarbonization technologies. This initiative will utilize a 'book-and-claim' system, allowing companies to purchase environmental attribute certificates to support clean production without being limited by geographical supply constraints.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, reflected on his life and career ahead of the release of his new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout." He discussed his spiritual journey, which led him to convert to Islam and temporarily abandon his music career, a decision he later realized was based on a misunderstanding of his faith. Now performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, he sees the combined name as representing the complete picture of his identity, with his songs serving as a biographical map of his life.</p>

          <p>Hosting "Saturday Night Live," musician Bad Bunny responded to criticism from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem regarding his upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. Noem had warned that immigration agents would be present and that only Americans should attend. In his monologue, Bad Bunny humorously addressed the controversy and spoke in Spanish to celebrate the contributions of Latinos in the United States, stating their mark can never be erased. The artist has previously cited fears of immigration raids as a reason for excluding the U.S. from his world tour.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the current negotiations as the closest the U.S. has come to securing the release of all hostages held in Gaza. He outlined a two-phase plan proposed by President Trump, starting with the swift release of hostages in exchange for an Israeli pullback, followed by discussions on Gaza's future governance by a non-terrorist, technocratic group. While expressing hope, Rubio cautioned that significant logistical hurdles and potential pitfalls remain, stressing that the hostage release must happen very quickly for the broader peace process to gain momentum.</p>

          <p>Three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis is returning to the screen after an eight-year absence in "Anemone," a film directed and co-written by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The actor, who previously announced his retirement, clarified he only intended to stop one kind of work to focus on others, including making fiddles. He revealed that the knowledge his son would be making films was a major impulse for his return. The film tells the story of a man in self-exile, a role Daniel Day-Lewis felt he understood early in the writing process.</p>

          <p>China is accelerating its strategic initiative to attract elite scientists from overseas, a key component of its upcoming 15th five-year plan. This push is highlighted by the recent appointment of former Harvard statistician Liu Jun to a prestigious position at Tsinghua University, joining other globally recognized academics who have recently returned. The trend reflects China's ambition to enhance its scientific and technological capabilities by building a formidable talent pool. This strategy aims to create a "snowball effect," bolstering domestic innovation and global competitiveness amid geopolitical headwinds and international competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but the tone of voice used during conversations. Research shows that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the words themselves, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. Travers advises individuals to become self-aware and quickly correct a harsh tone by pausing and rephrasing. He also suggests that the person on the receiving end should calmly ask their partner to try again, interrupting the cycle of escalation without becoming defensive.</p>

The law also makes the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent and expands eligibility for higher-income owners, providing substantial opportunities for small businesses to reduce their taxable income.

Using an income-replacement model, the bank calculates that a household earning $90,000 annually would need approximately $700,000 by age 65 to maintain their lifestyle, factoring in Social Security benefits. A seven-figure target is only deemed necessary for households currently earning $125,000 or more.
