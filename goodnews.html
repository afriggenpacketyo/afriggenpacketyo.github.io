          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears to existing owners, valuing the team at an NFL record of $8.9 billion. The stake was held by the estate of Andrew McKenna, with the majority going to the McCaskey family, increasing their ownership to approximately 77%. This valuation surpasses previous records for minority stake sales in NFL teams, reflecting the increasing value of NFL franchises. The Bears are exploring building a new stadium in Arlington Heights to host year-round events and generate more non-NFL revenue. The article is not giving investment advice.</p>

          <p>Lithium Americas' stock surged after the Trump administration proposed taking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company as it renegotiates a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy. The proposed equity stake is intended to create a cash buffer and reduce risk for taxpayers. Lithium Americas is developing the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, expected to be a significant source of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The project is a joint venture with General Motors, which has agreed to purchase lithium from the mine when it becomes operational. The article is not giving investment advice.</p>

          <p>A police chase involving a suspected stolen big rig concluded in Buena Park after the driver refused to stop, leading officers on a pursuit across multiple counties. The chase ended when an armored vehicle broadsided the big rig, cutting off its path, after which the occupants surrendered at gunpoint. During the chase, the big rig's passenger interacted with a pedestrian and appeared to pick up an item from an SUV. The incident brought attention to the challenges of pursuing a large vehicle and ensuring public safety during the chase. The article is not giving investment advice.</p>

          <h2>Common Debt Payoff Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With debt levels rising, Americans are working to pay down balances, but common mistakes can hinder progress, such as only making minimum payments, which barely reduces the principal. Taking on new debt while paying off old balances can erase gains, and ignoring available resources like credit counseling can lead to overpaying. Draining emergency funds to pay down debt can leave borrowers vulnerable, and failing to adjust spending habits risks repeating the cycle. Delaying action allows interest to compound, making debt more expensive, so consistent steps are crucial for effective debt repayment. The article is not giving investment advice.</p>

          <h2>Best Ways to Pay Off Multiple Debts Simultaneously</h2>

          <p>Managing multiple debts can be challenging, but structured strategies can improve efficiency, including the debt snowball method, which focuses on paying off the smallest balance first for psychological wins. The debt avalanche method prioritizes debts with the highest interest rates to save money, while balance transfer credit cards offer 0% introductory APRs to pay down balances without interest. Debt consolidation loans combine multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, and debt management plans, offered by credit counseling agencies, can lower interest rates. Debt settlement may reduce the principal owed, but it impacts credit score. The article is not giving investment advice.</p>

          <p>The average credit card balance has climbed to $6,500, with rising utilization rates reflecting financial strain on borrowers, prompting the need for effective strategies to tackle credit card debt. Debt consolidation loans can reduce interest charges by combining balances into a single fixed-rate loan, while balance transfers offer 0% APR periods to pay down principal without additional interest. Debt settlement may reduce the total debt burden for those facing hardship, and credit counseling can provide guidance and potentially reduce interest rates. Starting immediately with a consistent payment plan is crucial to regain control of finances. The article is not giving investment advice.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are challenging President Trump's advice to avoid acetaminophen (Tylenol) during pregnancy, citing potential harm to women and babies from untreated fevers. Trump suggested pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking Tylenol, despite medical consensus that fevers can be dangerous during pregnancy. Doctors warn that fevers, especially in early pregnancy, are associated with cardiac issues and central nervous system abnormalities. They emphasize that acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain and fever relief during pregnancy, and that there is no evidence that it causes autism.

          <p>Homeowners with substantial equity are considering home equity loans and HELOCs, both of which are less expensive than personal loans and credit cards. As the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, these options become more affordable, but home equity loans have fixed rates while HELOCs have variable rates. HELOCs are better positioned to exploit future rate cuts, but their variable rates can make budgeting difficult. Home equity loans offer stability, but borrowers may miss out on further rate cuts unless they refinance. The article advises careful consideration of the pros and cons of each option.
