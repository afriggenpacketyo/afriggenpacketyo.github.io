          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he will now fully focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. This decision follows controversy and disagreements between Hogg and senior DNC leaders, including chair Ken Martin. Despite these disagreements, Hogg expressed respect for his fellow officers, and Martin commended Hogg's activism and dedication to the party, wishing him well in his future endeavors. With Hogg's departure, the DNC will proceed with its re-do election without him.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a spending review that includes an extra ¬£29 billion per year for the NHS in England, along with increased funding for defense and housing. The government aims to boost artificial intelligence and transport projects as part of its plan to "renew Britain". While some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes, the review prioritizes security, economic growth, and a future-proof NHS. The Spending Review includes ¬£39 billion over 10 years for social and affordable housing and an increase in police funding, contingent on local council tax increases, and the government plans to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 documented the appearance of a mysterious new star, later identified as a nova, providing unprecedented details about its size, brightness, and position. The rediscovered memorial, written by Hanlin Academy scholar Hu Guang, confirms the phenomenon was a nova, the slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, settling a debate among modern astronomers. The detailed observations, including the star's size and brightness, have helped researchers narrow down the star's possible position. This discovery provides valuable insights into the astronomical knowledge and recording practices of ancient Chinese astronomers.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, known as Aukus, to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending. The agreement, aimed at countering China's growing power, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the US and developing a new fleet with shared technology. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the significance of the US review, emphasizing that it is common for a new administration to reassess agreements.</p>

While details remain limited, the deal aims to address concerns over China's rare earth mineral exports and U.S. restrictions on semiconductors. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that a more comprehensive trade deal will take time to achieve, and that the U.S. may extend its 90-day tariff pause with key trading partners.</p>
