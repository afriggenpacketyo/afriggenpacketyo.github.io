          <p>Canada Goose shares surged after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' expectations, though it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited unpredictable global trade and consumer spending patterns as reasons for the decision. COO Beth Clymer stated that most of Canada Goose's units are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and thus exempt from President Trump's tariffs. Despite tariff concerns, CEO Dani Reiss expressed confidence in the brand's strength and adaptability, while CFO Neil Bowden noted tariffs are not directly material to fiscal 2026 financial plans.

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix, known for its grandeur and history, faces questions about whether its narrow, tight circuit has become stagnant and boring.

          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups, such as seniors, but will require extensive clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine makers must conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for approval in healthy individuals aged 6 months to 64 years. The FDA is urging new studies in adults aged 50 to 64 and children under 5. This new framework comes ahead of a key meeting to decide on updating the strain used in next season's shots.</p>

The report highlights that telework offers clear advantages when organizations embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking, and available regulatory guidance. Companies that disregard these insights risk talent attrition, increased costs, and reduced agility. The report shows that flexibility now drives talent acquisition and retention more powerfully than traditional perks. One technology firm cited in the report cut voluntary turnover by 33% after offering two remote days each week.</p>
