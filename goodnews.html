          <p>President Trump is set to release a report from the White House‚Äôs Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., identifying key drivers of chronic disease in children, such as ultra-processed foods, vaccination, and environmental toxins. The report, however, does not offer specific policy prescriptions, instead serving as a high-level statement about the nation's health crisis. The report is already facing pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry, who are concerned about the focus on agricultural chemicals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a narrow 215-214 vote, advancing President Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of internal GOP disputes.

          <p>This article explains the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which allows Americans to deduct some of their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. The SALT cap, set at $10,000 by Trump's 2017 tax cuts, has stirred controversy, particularly among lawmakers from high-tax states. The article details how the SALT cap became a sticking point in the GOP's spending and tax bill, highlighting the fragile political process in Congress and the complex Republican coalition. A deal was ultimately made to raise the cap, illustrating the challenges of legislating in a divided caucus.</p>

          <p>Alberta, a conservative Western province in Canada, is laying the groundwork to hold a referendum asking voters whether they support seceding from Canada. The move comes as the country finds its footing after a political transition and amid trade tensions with the United States. The province, often referred to as ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs Texas,‚Äù has long felt disgruntled with its place in Canada‚Äôs federal system, which they see as unfairly limiting the province‚Äôs vast oil-and-gas resources while dutifully collecting taxes.</p>
