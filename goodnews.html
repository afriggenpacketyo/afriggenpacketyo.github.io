        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, the ex-congressman convicted of fraud and identity theft, allowing his immediate release. Santos was serving an 87-month sentence after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Trump stated Santos had been mistreated in solitary confinement and praised his loyalty to the Republican party. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023, had appealed for clemency, claiming his sentence was politically motivated, with Marjorie Taylor Greene supporting his appeal as well. This is Trump's latest act of clemency for former Republican politicians. The tone of the article is factual and informative, reporting on the commutation and its context.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The north Pacific Ocean experienced its warmest summer on record, marked by a marine heatwave that has confounded climate scientists. Sea surface temperatures between July and September exceeded the previous high of 2022 by more than 0.25C, across a vast area. While climate change contributes to marine heatwaves, the intensity and duration of this event are not fully explained by current climate models. Some researchers suggest that changes in shipping fuels, which reduced sulfur dioxide emissions, and efforts to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities may have inadvertently contributed to the warming. The article discusses the unusual warming trend in the north Pacific and potential factors contributing to it.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council rebuked City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto for attempting to lift a federal judge's order prohibiting the LAPD from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The council voted to direct Feldstein Soto to withdraw her request, which she subsequently did. The lawsuit prompting the ban was brought by the Los Angeles Press Club and Status Coup, citing instances of excessive force against journalists during protests over Trump's immigration crackdown. Council members expressed frustration with the city attorney's office and the rising cost of legal payouts.

However, in an era where the technological hardware and network infrastructure are already quite sophisticated in China, particularly in the GBA – home to tech giants like Huawei, Tencent and DJI – the biggest challenge is no longer simply boosting connectivity, but rather understanding why we are connecting and what we are connecting to. The next round of competition will be for cultural influence.</p>
