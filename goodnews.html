          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, reaching 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani was hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his aggressive approach on the mound, viewing it as a positive step in his recovery.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in many public outdoor areas, including all beaches, parks, and the vicinity of schools and libraries. The new regulations, which took effect Sunday, are part of a national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to protect children from passive smoke. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not extend to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, a point of difference with upcoming rules in neighboring Spain.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the U.S. and Canada are holding large-scale Pride parades, marking the culmination of a month of LGBTQ+ celebrations. Events in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto are characterized by a mix of jubilant street parties and a more defiant, protest-oriented tone compared to recent years. Organizers and participants are highlighting the need to resist recent political and legislative rollbacks targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender individuals. This year's parades also face headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader trend of companies scaling back on diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, held multiple discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as the two countries work to resolve contentious trade issues. The talks, held in Washington, are focused on finding a mutually beneficial agreement, but significant differences remain, particularly regarding U.S. tariffs on Japanese automobiles and auto parts. Japan is prioritizing the mitigation of a 27.5 percent tariff on its vehicles imposed by the Trump administration. The negotiations are ongoing as Akazawa has extended his stay to continue pursuing a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan requiring food businesses, including major supermarkets and manufacturers, to make healthy food more appealing and accessible to customers. This voluntary partnership aims to tackle rising obesity rates by encouraging retailers to use strategies like promotions on healthy items or adjusting loyalty point systems. While the plan increases accountability by requiring businesses to report on healthy food sales, it does not set specific targets. The initiative is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS to improve national health and reduce strain on the healthcare system.</p>

The team recently lived together in a "virtual athletes' village" during a domestic competition, simulating the unfamiliar and challenging conditions of an Olympic Games. The goal is to help athletes, particularly younger ones, build resilience and teamwork by facing logistical hurdles and living in close quarters away from home.

          <p>Primary schools in Kent, UK, are trialing a new educational program designed to teach children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future rates of skin cancer. The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund charity, teaches pupils how to read UV indexes and apply sunscreen correctly, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. With melanoma cases projected to rise, experts stress the importance of prevention, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases risk later in life. The program is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026 as part of the standard health curriculum.</p>

The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which boasts a 98 percent success rate, is now being retired in favor of the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket.

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The massive turnout was partly fueled by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. The city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, and the event proceeded peacefully, transforming from an LGBT celebration into a broader protest for human rights and solidarity. Participants used the march to mock Orban and express frustration with his authoritarian policies.</p>
