          <p>Nigerian authorities confirmed the rescue of 76 hostages, many of them children, from a 'bandit' camp in Katsina state following precision airstrikes. This operation is part of a broader strategy to dismantle criminal networks responsible for widespread killings, kidnappings, and extortion in remote areas. The rescued group included individuals taken during a recent mosque assault that killed 50 people, highlighting the ongoing security challenges in the region. The military also conducted an airstrike on a militant camp in northeastern Nigeria, where clashes with insurgents have displaced millions and claimed tens of thousands of lives.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS), sending a Dragon capsule with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies, including an innovative thruster kit. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, with the Dragon scheduled to dock at the ISS approximately 29 hours later. This mission delivers critical crew supplies, scientific gear, and station hardware, notably a new propulsion system designed to help maintain the ISS's altitude, supplementing Russian re-boost operations.

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly thriving in urban environments across the U.S., with a pair named Romeo and Juliet becoming a notable presence in New York City's Central Park. Photographers and naturalists are documenting their movements, aiming to educate the public about coexistence and dispel fears, as coyotes rarely attack humans. Their expansion eastward is attributed to declining predators and the transformation of farmland into suburbs, showcasing their adaptability to city habitats. While officials have historically mishandled urban coyote encounters, New York City has adopted a new approach focused on conservation and responsible management, encouraging observation from a distance to ensure safety for both humans and wildlife.</p>

Painted in the Chinese navy's white-grey-blue camouflage, the vessel's length is estimated to exceed 15 meters, suggesting significant capabilities. Although it has windows, indicating potential crewed operation, its primary design points to autonomous or remote-controlled functions.
