          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a higher open, following a positive performance on Wall Street overnight, despite geopolitical undercurrents. India's markets are a key focus as the Trump administration's additional 50% tariffs on Indian exports, in response to its Russian energy purchases, come into effect. Major indices across the region, including Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng, are all signaling a stronger start to trading. This upward momentum on Wall Street occurred as investors largely overlooked President Trump's removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, instead turning their attention to upcoming quarterly earnings reports from major tech companies like Nvidia.

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced its decision to revert to its iconic original logo, abandoning a recent rebranding initiative that ignited significant backlash from conservative customers and prominent political figures, including President Trump. The controversy arose when the company introduced a streamlined logo without its long-standing "Uncle Herschel" mascot, leading to accusations of going "woke" and a subsequent drop in stock value. President Trump publicly urged the company to listen to its customers and restore the traditional branding, amplifying the pressure. This reversal, which the company stated was a direct response to customer voices and their love for the brand, saw Cracker Barrel's stock trading up over 6% following the announcement, aiming to restore consumer trust and brand identity.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is advocating for national self-reliance, urging citizens to "make in India and spend in India" as the Trump administration's 50% tariffs on Indian exports take effect. Modi's message, delivered during Independence Day celebrations, aims to counter the economic blow from these tariffs, which will significantly impact various export-driven industries. The government is also planning a "massive tax bonanza" through a simplified two-tier Goods & Service Tax (GST) system and income tax cuts, expected to boost private consumption and provide a meaningful push to the economy. This fiscal stimulus is seen as crucial for consumption recovery amidst global geopolitical tensions and adverse tariff developments. (not investment advice)</p>

This image, captured by Bidyut Kalita, vividly illustrates the insect's diligent effort to secure food for its offspring. The article also presents other highly praised entries, including a brown-throated sloth navigating fragmented habitats, emperor penguin chicks making their perilous first leap into the icy ocean, and a poignant depiction of an Asian elephant foraging at a waste disposal site. These powerful photographs collectively offer a glimpse into the natural world's beauty and the critical environmental challenges it faces, with an exhibition planned at the Natural History Museum.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's colossal Starship megarocket is preparing for its tenth test flight, following two recent cancellations due to an oxygen leak and adverse weather conditions. Standing 403 feet tall, this mission is critical after three consecutive explosive failures of the upper stage, raising questions about its reliability for future lunar and Mars colonization goals. The flight aims to stress-test the Super Heavy booster under various conditions and send the upper stage across the globe, deploying dummy Starlink satellites before splashing down. Despite setbacks, SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" approach and Musk's ambitious timeline for frequent launches highlight the high stakes of this developmental program.</p>

          <p>Barbara Dee Crosby, an 85-year-old woman with dementia, was successfully found after going missing in rural California, thanks to the unwavering loyalty of her Chihuahua mix, Poncho. Crosby had wandered from her senior living home, prompting a widespread search effort. Timely sightings of Poncho ultimately guided rescue teams to Crosby, who was discovered asleep on a challenging 70-foot embankment. While Crosby was safely extracted and transported to a hospital for evaluation, Poncho regrettably ran off before being secured.
