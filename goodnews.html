          <p>Approximately 200 Marines arrived in Los Angeles to guard the Wilshire Federal Building, a rare deployment of military forces on U.S. soil.  This follows President Trump's federalization of National Guard troops and Marines in response to protests related to immigration enforcement operations.  A legal challenge to the deployment is ongoing, but the troops are permitted to remain in L.A. until at least June 17. The Marines' sole mission is to protect federal property and personnel.</p>
