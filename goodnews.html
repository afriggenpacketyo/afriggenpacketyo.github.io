          <p>Milan Mandaric, the Serbian-American businessman who formerly owned English football clubs Portsmouth, Leicester City, and Sheffield Wednesday, has died at 87 after a short illness. Known as football's 'Mr Fixit,' Mandaric rescued Portsmouth from bankruptcy and oversaw promotions for Leicester and Sheffield Wednesday. His family's statement highlighted his profound love for football, surpassed only by his devotion to his family. Mandaric's career also included founding successful electronics businesses in the US and a notable tax evasion acquittal with Harry Redknapp.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel has agreed to an 'initial withdrawal line' in Gaza, which has been shared with Hamas, potentially triggering an immediate ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed being 'on the verge of a very great achievement,' hoping to announce the return of all hostages soon. The plan's first stage involves Hamas releasing all Israeli hostages while the IDF redeploys but maintains control of strategic areas. Trump expressed confidence this agreement could bring an end to the '3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE.'</p>

          <p>Hearts are fueling optimism among their fans, now five points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership after an unbeaten start to the season, including a 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner. Head coach Derek McInnes acknowledges the fans' excitement, despite downplaying title talk himself. The club's strong performance, backed by a £10 million investment, is making previously sneered-at predictions of challenging for second place seem more realistic. While caution is urged due to past collapses, former players agree fans have every right to be optimistic.</p>

His election is seen as a significant step for diversity, encouraging others from underrepresented communities to consider similar roles. Curry's goals include fostering a more connected church, despite challenges faced by mainline Protestant denominations, such as declining membership and theological disputes.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, targeting those paying out-of-pocket as many insurers do not cover these drugs. This move aims to increase access and demand for semaglutide, which has seen soaring prices and supply limitations, amidst a growing market for weight-loss drugs. Costco's entry could significantly impact the accessibility of these popular medications. (not investment advice)</p>
