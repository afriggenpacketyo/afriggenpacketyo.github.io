          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, defying expectations of a decrease, according to Eurostat data. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, with services inflation also increasing to 3.9%, potentially due to Easter timing effects. Despite this, economists believe the door remains open for further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB), especially as US tariffs impact the labor market. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated that the disinflationary process is on track, although uncertainty remains due to potential countermeasures against US tariffs and Germany's infrastructure package.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig reflects on the relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" in the context of the Trump administration's policies. Eig argues that Dr. King's message, rooted in the belief that love can overcome cruelty, offers a path forward for those who disapprove of current tactics. Dr. King's protests in Birmingham aimed to condemn segregation and call Americans to action, and his example can inspire those seeking to fight back against injustice today. The author suggests specific actions inspired by King's example, including economic boycotts and leveraging the moral authority of clergy.</p>
