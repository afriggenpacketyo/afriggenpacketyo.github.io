          <p>China's top economic planning agency is promoting a measured approach to its "AI Plus" initiative, which aims to integrate artificial intelligence across various industries. Officials have urged regions to avoid "disorderly competition and blind expansion," instead focusing on developing AI applications tailored to their specific industrial strengths and resources. The government plans to continue subsidizing companies' access to computing power and pilot consumer subsidies for AI products to encourage adoption. This strategy is part of China's broader push for technological self-reliance and innovation to bolster its economy.</p>

          <p>A legislative effort to prohibit members of Congress and their immediate families from trading individual stocks is gaining broad, bipartisan support, with proponents including President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The push for a ban aims to address public concerns about potential conflicts of interest and restore trust in government institutions. Supporters argue that the practice undermines faith in the financial system, as lawmakers may have access to non-public information. Data shows that many members of Congress have achieved market returns that significantly outperform standard indexes, fueling suspicion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming 2025 NFL season could see several long-standing records fall, according to sports analysts. Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little is a candidate to break the record for the longest field goal, having hit a 70-yarder in preseason. Patrick Mahomes is on track to become the fastest quarterback to 250 career passing touchdowns, likely achieving the feat within the first two weeks. Additionally, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow is in a position to challenge the record for the most 500-yard passing games, while receiver Ja'Marr Chase could contend for the single-season reception record.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast, communities are reflecting on a long and uneven recovery. The storm's 30-foot surge obliterated tens of thousands of homes and killed 238 people in the state. Former Governor Haley Barbour recalls the initial collapse of the federal logistical response but notes that substantial federal aid and over 900,000 volunteers were crucial for rebuilding. While some areas have bounced back, others like Waveland, which was considered "ground zero," still show visible scars and have struggled with population loss and a slow return of infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Starting in January, the NHS will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This public health initiative aims to protect children from the varicella virus and its rare but severe complications, while also saving parents from taking time off work to care for sick children. Until now, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost, and the UK had lagged behind other countries like the US in offering it publicly.</p>

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports will remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The deal averts a potential blackout that could have affected nearly 10 million subscribers, who would have missed major sporting events like college football and the upcoming NFL season. While financial terms were not disclosed, the negotiations were reportedly tense, with YouTube initially stating that Fox was demanding significantly higher fees than comparable content providers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have designed and tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone with an aerodynamic form that closely resembles the "Gimbal" unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) recorded by U.S. Navy pilots in 2015. The experimental aircraft features an elliptical, closed-loop wing structure with a central wing section, giving it a spindle-like appearance. This innovative design, which integrates rotors at the wing junctions, could potentially offer enhanced endurance, stability, and versatility for uncrewed aerial vehicles. The development represents a significant departure from conventional drone designs.</p>
