          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While the quake was one of the strongest ever recorded, the resulting tsunami waves were relatively small, causing only minor flooding in some coastal areas of Hawaii. Authorities initially issued evacuation orders and advisories, but these were later downgraded or lifted as the threat subsided. Experts noted that a tsunami is a series of waves and effects could continue for some time, but no major damage or serious injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks has agreed to acquire Israeli identity security firm CyberArk in a landmark deal valued at approximately $25 billion. The acquisition aims to integrate CyberArk's identity management tools into Palo Alto's broader security platform, addressing a critical market segment as AI-driven cyber threats increase. This move reflects a larger trend of consolidation within the cybersecurity industry, following other major acquisitions like Google's purchase of Wiz. The deal is expected to significantly accelerate the reach of CyberArk's technology by leveraging Palo Alto's extensive market presence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Savers can currently earn substantially more interest by opting for high-yield savings accounts over traditional ones. While the national average interest rate for standard savings accounts is a mere 0.38%, top high-yield accounts are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, with some even higher. This significant difference can dramatically accelerate savings growth over time, especially with the power of compounding interest. Financial experts recommend looking at online banks, which often provide the most competitive rates and lower fees due to their reduced overhead costs compared to brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>The price of gold is currently trading around $3,325 per ounce, reflecting its continued appeal as a safe-haven asset for investors. The precious metal's value is influenced by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Historically, gold is sought after during times of market volatility and geopolitical turmoil, as it tends to retain its value when fiat currencies weaken. Other key drivers of its price include interest rate policies, currency movements against the U.S. dollar, and the buying and selling activities of central banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum network is experiencing a resurgence in institutional interest, signaling a potentially bright future despite recent market struggles. The passage of U.S. crypto legislation, particularly around stablecoins which predominantly operate on Ethereum, has made its native token, ether, more attractive to large investors. While ether's price has yet to surpass its 2021 peak, the focus has shifted from speculative trends like NFTs to the tokenization of real-world assets by major financial institutions. Experts suggest Ethereum is now entering an "institutional arc," similar to Bitcoin's trajectory in previous years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The pro-Palestinian direct-action group Palestine Action has successfully won the right to a High Court review of the UK government's decision to ban it under terrorism legislation. The organization, known for targeting defense firms linked to Israel, was proscribed last month after causing significant damage during protests. Lawyers for the group argued the ban infringes on the right to free speech and legitimate protest, while the government maintains it was justified due to serious criminal activity. The court's ruling suggests the ban may conflict with free speech rights and that the Home Secretary could have consulted the group before implementing it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprising resilience, expanding at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts. This growth was largely driven by a significant turnaround in the trade balance and a rebound in consumer spending, according to the Commerce Department. The figures were notably influenced by trade dynamics, as a sharp decrease in imports—a reaction to President Trump's tariffs—statistically boosted the GDP calculation. While the report indicates underlying economic strength, some metrics, like final sales to private domestic purchasers, suggest a potential slowdown in demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Similarly, Chile transformed its disaster policies after a catastrophic 1960 quake, focusing on resilient construction and national preparedness.

The movie, which also stars Will Arnett and Laura Dern, follows a couple on the verge of splitting up as Arnett's character delves into the New York stand-up comedy scene. Described as more intimate and scrappier than Cooper's previous directorial efforts like "A Star Is Born," the film features a distinct handheld camera aesthetic. The festival's artistic director noted the film's bittersweet tone, likening it to a modern take on the classic comedy of remarriage.</p>

This decision comes despite intense and public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Fed officials have indicated that economic instability, partly fueled by the administration's tariff policies and rising inflation, makes it prudent to pause rate changes for now. The central bank aims to balance its dual mandate of low unemployment and stable prices, and its independence from political influence is considered a cornerstone of economic stability.
