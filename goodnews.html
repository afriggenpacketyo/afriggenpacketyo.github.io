          <p>An opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, is an ideal candidate to host the 2036 Olympic Games. The author suggests that the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network would minimize the economic burden typically associated with hosting the event. By leveraging current infrastructure and employing temporary venues for certain sports, the Greater Bay Area could present a cost-effective and sustainable model for the Olympics while showcasing the region's collaborative potential.</p>

          <p>Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered a strong performance in a rehab start for the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, potentially putting him back in contention for a spot on the postseason roster. In his outing, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and recorded pitches exceeding 100 mph, demonstrating a significant improvement after previous struggles. While a starting role is unlikely, his performance suggests he could contribute as a valuable arm out of the bullpen as the team finalizes its roster for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a congressional seat in Northern Virginia, further reducing the Republican majority in the House to 219-213.

His victory comes as Congress faces a looming government shutdown deadline, with key local issues including President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, which employs a significant portion of the district's residents.</p>

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, with the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. The test, which measures a protein called p-tau217, is expected to increase the accuracy of early-stage diagnosis from 70% to over 90%, offering a less invasive and more accessible alternative to current methods like PET scans. Scientists hope the trial will demonstrate the test's effectiveness within the NHS, paving the way for faster diagnoses and better patient care.</p>

By prioritizing the needs of its riders and implementing practical changes without a budget increase, Akron's transit system has become a model for effective public transportation.</p>

The policy shift aims to prevent young Ukrainians from losing their connection to the country and addresses concerns about a brain drain, though it also comes amid ongoing discussions about military manpower needs.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions without a PIN. If approved, banks and card providers would be able to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the growing popularity of tap-to-pay technology, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA insists that providers would implement risk-based controls and consumers would remain protected.</p>

          <p>Apple's newly unveiled, ultra-thin iPhone Air may face a staggered or limited release in mainland China due to its adoption of eSIM technology over physical SIM cards. Currently, only one of China's three major mobile carriers supports eSIMs, and regulators may require more time to approve and encourage broader adoption of the standard. This regulatory hurdle could create a temporary competitive advantage for domestic phone manufacturers in one of Apple's most important markets, as none currently use the technology.</p>
