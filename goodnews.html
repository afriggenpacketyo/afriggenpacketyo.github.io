          <p>Alaska Airlines is expanding its global presence by launching new flights from Seattle to London and Reykjavik, Iceland, beginning next May. This move follows the airline's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and signals a strategic push into the lucrative international travel market, which has shown more resilience than domestic demand. The carrier will use its Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for the daily London route and a 737 MAX 8 for the seasonal Iceland service. In line with this expansion, the airline also unveiled a new livery for its Dreamliner fleet, inspired by the northern lights.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill leads Republican Jack Ciattarelli by six percentage points in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, a key contest viewed as a bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections. The survey shows Sherrill with 48% support to Ciattarelli's 42%, though a significant number of voters remain undecided. Affordability and taxes are the top issues for New Jersey voters, with Ciattarelli seen as stronger on taxes and Sherrill perceived as better for creating economic opportunities. The poll also reflects voter concern over the national political climate and its influence on state-level issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article examines the public and media controversies surrounding actress Sydney Sweeney, particularly her recent American Eagle denim advertisement and other commercial partnerships. The author argues that criticism of Sweeney's numerous brand deals, from luxury fashion to soap containing her bathwater, is often unwarranted and stems from a desire to police a successful woman's choices. The piece frames Sweeney's unapologetic commercial instincts as a masterful understanding of modern celebrity, contrasting it with the performative activism of other stars. Ultimately, it posits that Sweeney is simply giving the public what it wants: a glamorous, larger-than-life movie star.</p>

          <p>RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is at the center of a transfer saga involving Manchester United and Newcastle United, with his future destination still uncertain. This article analyzes the pros and cons for the £70m-rated Slovenian player at each Premier League club, as well as the option of remaining at Leipzig. While Newcastle has reportedly made a formal bid, Manchester United's interest is contingent on generating funds from player sales. The analysis weighs factors such as guaranteed playing time, participation in European competitions, and the overall stability and ambition of each interested club.</p>

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" marks its 100th anniversary, this article explores its enduring relevance as a profound depiction of a midlife crisis. The narrative, which follows protagonist Clarissa Dalloway over a single day in London, masterfully intertwines past, present, and future to explore themes of regret, identity, and the paths not taken. Woolf herself began the novel at age 40, channeling her own experiences of middle age into the work. The article argues that the novel's stream-of-consciousness style and its protagonist's deep introspection on life's choices make it a foundational text for understanding this complex and transformative life stage.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the official guidelines and legal constraints that police forces in England and Wales navigate when releasing information about suspects to the media. It explains that while contempt of court laws prevent the release of prejudicial information, the College of Policing's guidance does not explicitly prohibit sharing a suspect's nationality or immigration status after they are charged. The piece highlights the discretion individual forces have, citing past instances where such details were released to quell public misinformation. This context is provided amid a current debate, sparked by a recent case, over whether police should be more transparent about these details.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance, signaling confidence in its performance driven by significant cost-cutting measures and strong second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The pharmaceutical giant's revenue was boosted by better-than-expected sales of its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, as well as other key drugs. The updated outlook accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The positive report suggests Pfizer's strategy to navigate the post-pandemic market and an upcoming patent cliff is gaining traction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA is accelerating its timeline to place a nuclear reactor on the Moon, aiming for deployment by 2030 as part of its broader ambition to establish a permanent human base. According to reports, the move is partly driven by geopolitical competition, with officials noting similar plans by China and Russia. A small nuclear reactor is seen by many scientists as the most reliable way to power a lunar settlement, as it can provide continuous energy during the Moon's two-week-long nights. However, the ambitious goal faces challenges, including recent NASA budget cuts and concerns that the plan is more politically than scientifically motivated.</p>

          <p>The newsletter platform Substack is becoming a significant force in the literary world, fostering a community of writers and critics reminiscent of the early-2000s blogosphere. As traditional media outlets reduce book coverage, Substack provides a direct, monetizable connection between authors and readers, giving rise to what some are calling "Substack summer." A new wave of novelists who built their audiences on the platform are gaining mainstream attention, often writing sprawling social fiction that marks a return to a style popularized by authors like Jonathan Franzen. The platform is seen as a vital space for substantive dialogue about books, filling a void left by other social media.</p>

          <p>A GPS-guided robot named Turf Tank is changing how athletic fields are lined, automating a task that traditionally required significant manual labor. The machine, controlled by a tablet, can accurately paint the boundaries for a soccer or football field in a fraction of the time it takes a human crew. This technology has become essential for large sports complexes, professional teams like the LA Galaxy, and numerous colleges and high schools. By making the process more efficient, the robots free up groundskeepers to focus on turf management rather than the tedious job of striping fields.</p>
