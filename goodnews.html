Website owners will now have to opt-in to allow their data to be used for training AI models, and Cloudflare will also offer a "pay per crawl" system for publishers who wish to charge for access. This policy could significantly impact AI developers by limiting the free availability of vast amounts of training data, potentially slowing the development of large language models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to nutrition experts, a common breakfast mistake of choosing carbohydrate-heavy foods over protein can lead to midday energy crashes and cravings for sugary snacks. Dietitians explain that protein digests more slowly than simple carbs, promoting longer-lasting fullness and helping to stabilize blood sugar levels throughout the day. They recommend consuming 20 to 30 grams of protein in the morning, suggesting simple additions like beans, hemp seeds, or Greek yogurt to common breakfast foods, and cautioning against processed, high-sugar options often marketed as healthy.</p>

          <p>A Citi report analyzing U.S. credit card data reveals a general decline in spending on luxury goods during the first five months of 2025 compared to the previous year. However, the jewelry category has proven to be a notable exception, consistently outperforming other segments like leather goods and ready-to-wear apparel with a significant year-over-year spending increase. Analysts suggest this trend is driven by the perception of jewelry as a more stable investment, especially with rising gold prices, and its higher sentimental value for consumers.
