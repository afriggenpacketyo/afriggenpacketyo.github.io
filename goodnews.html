          <p>Meta is filing a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which allows users to create nonconsensual, sexualized images of others using AI technology. The lawsuit aims to stop Joy Timeline from advertising on Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram. This action follows multiple attempts by the CrushAI maker to circumvent Meta's ad review process after repeated removals of ads that violated Meta's policies. Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove such ads. The author's tone is assertive and resolute, emphasizing Meta's commitment to protecting its community from abuse. </p>
