          <p>President Trump has rejected the notion that he is backing down on tariff threats, dismissing the "TACO trade" label coined by a Financial Times columnist. Trump asserted that his tariff announcements are a negotiation tactic that has led to progress in trade discussions with other countries. He defended his approach, stating that it has prompted the European Union to engage in meetings and negotiations. Trump criticized the questioning of his strategy as "nasty," emphasizing that his actions are aimed at gaining ground for the U.S. in trade agreements.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Nuclear Power Orders Could Spur Small Reactor Deployment by 2030, Says GE Vernova CEO</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 14:22:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik, President Trump's recent executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030. Trump's orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite decisions on applications for new nuclear plants, potentially leading to construction approvals for SMRs by 2027. GE Vernova recently secured approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, marking the first SMR deployment in the West, and the Tennessee Valley Authority has applied to build a GE Vernova reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Strazik notes high customer interest in SMRs due to their carbon-free emissions, with users increasingly willing to pay a premium for nuclear energy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 14:21:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor is aiming for substantial growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), twenty-five years after introducing hybrid vehicles to the American market with the Prius. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030, though this target may change based on regulations and customer acceptance. This expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, in which the company also continues to invest significantly. Toyota's planned PHEV expansion aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles in the state by 2035, though President Trump is expected to eliminate that rule.</p>

Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressed disappointment that the bill increases the budget deficit. Trump responded that the bill had to pass the House and that it contains both positive and negative aspects. The bill is projected to increase the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, and Musk has scaled back his DOGE work to focus on his companies.</p>

Titanium dioxide is a food additive used to make food look whiter and opaque, and has been identified by the Make America Healthy Again Commission as a potential concern. The report stated that the additive may cause cellular and DNA damage, and the European Union banned the additive in 2022 following a report by the European Food Safety Authority which pointed to genotoxicity.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that cats use scent to differentiate their owners from strangers. The researchers found that cats spent twice as long smelling samples from strangers compared to their owners and favored their right nostrils when sniffing scents from unfamiliar humans. This nostril preference may correspond to how animals process new information. The study also indicated that a cat's personality influences how they interact with odors, with more "neurotic" male cats repeatedly returning to smell tubes, while more "agreeable" ones rarely did.</p>
