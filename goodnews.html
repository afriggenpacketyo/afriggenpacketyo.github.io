        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump intends to maintain a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, even after the recently announced trade deal with the United Kingdom. This policy means that despite the new trade agreement, goods from the U.K. will still be subject to a 10% tariff. The Trump administration's broader trade strategy includes imposing tariffs on various imports, including steel, aluminum, and vehicles, to promote reciprocity and fairness in international trade. The article also notes that the U.K. had relatively low tariffs on most U.S. goods prior to April 2025, while also including the UK's average tariff rate.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another radar and communication outage, lasting 90 seconds, disrupting air traffic control operations. This incident follows a similar outage in April, which caused significant travel delays and stress among controllers. The FAA is working to modernize the aging facilities and technology used by controllers, but the recent outages highlight the urgent need for improvements to ensure air travel safety and reliability. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has unveiled plans to overhaul the system, with aviation industry groups and labor unions urging Congress to approve funding for these upgrades.</p>

          <p>While tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon reported strong first-quarter ad sales, signs of a slowdown are emerging due to President Trump's trade war. Meta noted reduced spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters due to the end of a trade loophole, and Alphabet and Pinterest executives expressed concerns about broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Snap even withdrew its second-quarter guidance due to the unpredictable economy. The article suggests that the digital advertising market, which has been robust, may face challenges as companies become more cautious about ad spending amid increased economic volatility and trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is considering a plan to offer Greenland a "compact of free association," similar to agreements with Pacific Island nations, to increase American influence on the island.

The move comes after President Trump expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, an idea rejected by Denmark, which governs the island.

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio is no longer viable due to increasing lifespans. With people living longer, investors need to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to equities to ensure they don't outlive their savings. Edelman recommends a 70% to 80% allocation to stocks for many investors. He highlights the increasing number of Americans living to 100 and beyond, driven by advancements in health technology and biotech, making it crucial to plan for extended retirement years.</p>
