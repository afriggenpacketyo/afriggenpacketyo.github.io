          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has announced he will not seek the Republican nomination for the Georgia Senate seat in the upcoming election, a key contest for control of the Senate. Kemp stated that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family. He has expressed his commitment to work alongside Senate GOP leadership and President Trump to ensure a strong Republican nominee can win the election next November. This decision leaves the field open for other potential Republican candidates to challenge Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing disillusionment with the Democratic Party's values. Villanueva criticized the "party of paid protests, purple hair, and pronouns" and embraced the Republican Party's focus on "faith, family, and freedom." Republican leaders in California welcomed the move, with some noting that the Democratic Party has lost its way and now champions crime and criminals. While some critics welcomed his departure, Republicans hope his switch signals a broader shift in California's political landscape ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual Met Gala has raised a record $31 million this year, solidifying its position as the city's pre-eminent benefit event. The proceeds will support the Costume Institute, the only department that independently raises its operating budget. This year's exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," marks a significant departure by focusing on designers of color and Black dandyism. Despite the gala's glamour and cultural cachet, staging the event is costly, with last year's gala incurring over $6 million in expenses, including entertainment. Anna Wintour's influence shapes the event, transforming it into a powerhouse of public relations and profitability for Vogue.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has decided against running for Senate in 2026, denying Republicans their strongest potential candidate against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp, a popular two-term governor, cited family reasons for his decision, though his complex relationship with Donald Trump loomed over a potential campaign. Despite Trump's past attacks, Kemp maintained a respectful distance, never engaging in performative groveling. Ossoff, who has already raised $11 million, is preparing for a tough race, accusing Trump of authoritarian impulses. Several other prominent Georgia Republicans are now likely to consider running for the open seat.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced his retirement as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, marking the end of an era for the investment giant. Buffett's leadership has been marked by constancy, integrity, and a long-term focus, leading to unprecedented growth in Berkshire's stock value. His commitment to shareholders and ethical practices have distinguished him on Wall Street, and his successor, Greg Abel, will have large shoes to fill. Buffett's departure signals the end of an era where he served as a backstop for the American financial system, offering stability and wisdom in times of crisis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to AAA, U.S. drivers are actually paying an average of $3.165 per gallon, significantly higher than Trump's claim. Trump's figure appears to be based on RBOB gasoline futures, which touched $1.98 per gallon but do not reflect the retail price paid by consumers. Analysts emphasize that the RBOB contract excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs, making it irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has a rich history of welcoming refugees, particularly after the Vietnam War, becoming one of the top states for Southeast Asian resettlement. Governor Wendell Anderson established the Indochinese Resettlement Office to provide services and support to refugees. Today, Minnesota is home to significant populations of Laotian, Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Hmong immigrants, with the largest concentration of Hmong in America. The state's welcoming environment and support programs helped these communities rebuild their lives.</p>
