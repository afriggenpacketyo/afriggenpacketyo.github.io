          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and guidance, despite President Trump's sweeping tariffs. The company's revenue grew 7.6% year over year, and it announced plans to acquire data management company Informatica for $8 billion. Salesforce introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents and reassigned 500 customer support workers, leading to $50 million in savings. Management anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $2.76 to $2.78 on revenue of $10.11 billion to $10.16 billion for the fiscal second quarter, and bumped up its full-year forecast.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, a setback for his economic agenda. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The ruling applies to trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs imposed in April to correct trade imbalances, but does not impact tariffs on specific products like aluminum and steel. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, indicated that purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in tariff talks. Akazawa emphasized that while security matters and tariff negotiations are distinct, such purchases could be within the scope of discussions. Japan hopes to arrange a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Trump during the G7 summit in June, with further ministerial-level talks anticipated beforehand. Ishiba has pledged to support the U.S. in reviving its shipbuilding industry amid China's dominance.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision.</p>

This technology, also used by the Pakistan Air Force, allows the destroyer to conduct long-range anti-ship and air-defense strikes without relying solely on its own radar systems. Battlefield data fusion enables seamless information sharing across domains.

Experts warn that household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population.

This push to expand manufacturing capabilities could run counter to the Trump administration's core demands in the ongoing trade talks, experts warn. There is "little scope" for China to budge and scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance.</p>
