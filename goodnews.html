          <p>David Marcus argues that the Trump administration's swift deployment of the National Guard and the promise of Marine support in Los Angeles have effectively quelled potential riots. This action encouraged a stronger local response and deterred ordinary citizens from joining the protests. Marcus contrasts this with the summer of 2020, when the previous administration did not mobilize the National Guard against the wishes of Democratic governors, resulting in widespread destruction. By stiffening the resolve of local law enforcement and discouraging large crowds, the Trump administration has transformed potentially deadly riots into manageable criminal acts, showing a lesson learned from past experiences.</p>

Christianity remains the largest religion, with 2.3 billion adherents, but its growth rate has declined.

However, the unveiling underwhelmed Wall Street, as investors are eager for substantial advancements in Apple's artificial intelligence strategy to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI.

          <p>Texas Roadhouse shares experienced a decline following the announcement of CFO Chris Monroe's departure, though the company suggests it was not due to any misconduct. Jim Cramer views the stock's reaction as a buying opportunity for those not already invested.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the development would create 10,000 jobs over the next decade and reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. However, the project is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, with power generation beginning in the mid-2030s. Despite government assurances, critics have raised concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact, with EDF also building a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which is expected to switch on in the early 2030s, which will be over a decade late and having cost billions more than originally planned.</p>

          <p>FanDuel is introducing a 50-cent surcharge on all wagers in Illinois to offset new state taxes, with DraftKings considering a similar move. The new tax applies to each wager accepted by sportsbooks, disproportionately affecting the two leading companies in the market. FanDuel stated that the surcharge would be removed if the state reverses its decision, while DraftKings anticipates taking action soon. Analysts estimate the new fee will generate significant revenue for both companies, but industry leaders argue that it will disproportionately impact lower wagering and potentially drive gamblers to unregulated operators.
