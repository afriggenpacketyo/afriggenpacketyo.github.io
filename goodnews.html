          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, securing their first title since relocating from Seattle. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points and 12 assists, while Jalen Williams contributed 20 points. The Thunder outscored the Pacers 34-20 in the third quarter, building a lead they would not relinquish. This victory marks the second championship for the franchise, with the Seattle SuperSonics winning in 1979; the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and the team has tied the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for third-most wins in any season with 84 games won between the regular season and the playoffs. The Pacers, despite a strong effort from Bennedict Mathurin, could not overcome the Thunder's dominance. The final score was 103-91.</p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris involving a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for ‚Ç¨130,000, bringing in hundreds of extras to act as guests. The park's staff became suspicious when they saw the young girl, who could barely stand in high heels, and alerted the authorities, suspecting it was an illegal child marriage. The girl's mother claimed she wanted her daughter to feel like a Disney princess for a day, according to investigators, and a medical examination showed the girl had not been harmed. Four people, including the supposed groom, the mother, and two Latvian nationals, have been taken into custody.</p>

          <p>Kyoto experienced a record number of foreign visitors in 2024, totaling 10.88 million, with overall visitors reaching the second-highest on record. Despite concerns about overtourism, satisfaction among both foreign and Japanese visitors remained high, with temples, shrines, and historic sites being the main attractions. Japanese visitors were more likely to be disappointed by the crowds compared to foreign tourists. A lodging tax increase is planned for 2026 to address overtourism issues, with revenue directed towards strengthening related measures.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is drawing renewed attention as Japan's first zero giant panda moment in over half a century approaches. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, China may seek to stabilize relations with Tokyo through panda loans. Foreign affairs experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. While pandas have been a symbol of friendship, some analysts are skeptical that a new loan will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic posture or public opinion.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence increases, potentially harmful responses are being uncovered, including hate speech, copyright infringements, or sexual content. Researchers say that a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models compound the emergence of these undesirable behaviors. Red teaming, a practice involving testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is one way to evaluate risks in AI. Standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives are some of the recommendations put forth to ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert suggests using alternative phrases to encourage cooperation in children, avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries fosters cooperation. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and focusing on readiness rather than issuing threats. Dismissing a child's emotions can lead to disconnection, and reframing frustrated questions can invite problem-solving.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England for those who meet strict criteria. The first group of patients eligible will be those with a BMI of 40 or over and four out of five specific conditions. Mounjaro, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, helps with weight loss by making people feel fuller. NHS England says a staggered approach is needed to manage GP workload and NHS resources, and some practices warn patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments.</p>

Western countries have imposed import taxes on Chinese EVs, but the UK has not, making it an attractive market for Chinese firms.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The clinic would offer the Category B drug to patients with hard-to-treat depression. This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, a medical anaesthetic, can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists, despite it not being licensed for the routine treatment for depression.</p>
