          <p>A suspect named Donald Henson has been arrested after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's field office in Pittsburgh in what officials initially called a "targeted attack." No injuries were reported, and Henson, who is believed to be a former military member with a history of mental health issues, was apprehended after fleeing the scene on foot. Authorities noted that Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint that was determined to have no federal nexus, and he is now facing federal charges for the incident.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range of 4.00%-4.25%, citing rising concerns about the U.S. labor market despite persistent inflation. The decision, made in an 11-to-1 vote, was accompanied by projections from the "dot plot" indicating the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut, emphasizing that downside risks to employment have increased, and the central bank is attentive to risks on both sides of its dual mandate.

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are finding it impossible to keep up with payments, especially on high-interest credit cards. This article outlines several strategies for individuals whose debt exceeds their ability to pay, moving beyond simple budgeting to more impactful solutions. Options include debt consolidation to secure a lower interest rate, negotiating a debt settlement for less than the full amount owed, entering a structured debt management plan through a credit counseling agency, or, as a last resort, filing for bankruptcy to achieve a financial reset.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack has been diagnosed with a dislocated elbow and is expected to be placed on injured reserve for four weeks, a significantly better outcome than the season-ending injury initially feared. The injury occurred during a collision with a teammate in the game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Mack's toughness, and while his absence is a blow to the defense, the team will rely on players like Tuli Tuipulotu and Bud Dupree to step up in his place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Dermatology suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, particularly for individuals with a prior history of the disease. The research, involving nearly 34,000 veterans, found that patients who took a 500 mg supplement twice daily after their first skin cancer diagnosis had a 54% lower risk of developing another one. These findings reinforce previous evidence and are leading dermatologists to more strongly recommend the widely available, over-the-counter supplement as a secondary prevention measure.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck discovered 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a World War I-era fishing vessel that sank nearly a century ago. The ship disappeared during a storm in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The salvage company Atlantic Wreck Salvage located the site in 2022 and confirmed its identity this year through distinctive features like its double drum trawl winch, hoping the discovery provides some closure for the descendants of the lost crew.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill known as the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act is gaining momentum in Congress, aiming to provide financial institutions with better tools to protect seniors and other vulnerable adults from abuse. The legislation would allow firms like mutual funds to temporarily delay transactions if they suspect financial exploitation, which costs older Americans an estimated $28.3 billion annually. The House version of the bill was unanimously approved by the Financial Services Committee, signaling strong cross-party support for measures to address this growing problem.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino stated that despite rising prices, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events, citing immense post-pandemic demand for live experiences. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the shift in music industry economics, where touring has become the primary revenue source for artists, justifying the high production costs and ticket prices for major tours. He argued that the average concert ticket price of $72 is a bargain compared to premium sports seating, reflecting the unique cultural value of shared live events. (not investment advice)</p>
