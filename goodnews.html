          <p>The recent summit between leaders of Asean, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and China signifies a convergence of economic powerhouses aiming to deepen cooperation in trade, supply chains, infrastructure, and finance.

          <p>Pupils at a primary school in east London have been ordered to stay indoors after a buzzard nested in the playground and began dive-bombing. The school is working with Havering Council to find a solution, but options are limited as buzzards are a protected species. The school is educating children about the bird, which they have named Brenda, and incorporating it into art and writing projects. A bird of prey expert visited the school with a Chilean blue buzzard eagle to educate the children about buzzards and conservation.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are casting their ballots in a snap election to choose a new president following the removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Pre-election surveys suggest Lee Jae-myung is poised for victory due to public frustration over Yoon's martial law declaration. The new president will face challenges including a slowing economy, US tariffs, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Lee has urged voters to deliver a stern judgement against conservatives, while Kim warned that a Lee victory would lead to excessive power and political retaliation.</p>

          <p>Borussia Dortmund is reportedly confident of signing Sunderland midfielder Jobe Bellingham.
