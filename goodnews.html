          <p>Actress Halle Berry recently celebrated her 59th birthday with a tropical vacation, sharing photos on social media from her getaway with her boyfriend, musician Van Hunt. The images show her enjoying the trip, including one series captioned "Making the most of a cloudy day." The article also touches upon recent public comments made by her ex-husband, David Justice, regarding their past marriage and traditional gender roles. Berry's social media posts are seen by some as a subtle response to these remarks, highlighting her current happiness and independence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential concession, made during a summit with President Trump, could be a significant breakthrough in negotiations to end the war, as it addresses Ukraine's security needs without formal NATO membership. The proposed arrangement would create a "Coalition of the willing" to defend Ukraine against future aggression. However, details remain unclear, and Ukrainian officials are seeking clarification on how such guarantees would function in practice.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, reflecting the influence of internet culture and societal shifts on the English language. Among the new entries are slang terms like "skibidi," a versatile nonsense word popularized by a YouTube series, and "tradwife," referring to a woman who promotes a traditional homemaker role on social media. Other additions highlight the impact of remote work, such as "mouse jiggler," a device to feign computer activity.

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler clinched the BMW Championship title after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot overnight lead, struggled in the final round. MacIntyre's hopes for a third PGA Tour victory faded after a difficult start, ultimately finishing with a three-over-par 73. Scheffler demonstrated his top form, securing the win with a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole to finish two strokes clear. A visibly frustrated MacIntyre expressed disappointment with his performance, citing unexpected issues with his ball distance throughout the challenging final day of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing deals. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift away from generic drugs towards more profitable novel treatments. This transition is expected to continue, with generics projected to constitute a much smaller portion of the company's revenue in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts hit a decisive go-ahead home run in the bottom of the eighth inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-4 victory and a series sweep against the San Diego Padres. The Dodgers had initially built a four-run lead but saw it erased as the Padres battled back to tie the game. Betts' clutch solo shot, a rare highlight in what has been a difficult season for the former MVP, secured the win and pushed the Dodgers two games ahead of the Padres in the National League West standings. The dramatic finish capped a crucial weekend series for both division rivals.</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the UK is in the midst of a leadership election that highlights a fundamental debate over its future direction. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a more aggressive, "eco-populist" approach to connect with voter anger over economic and social inequality, arguing the party is often "too nice." His opponents, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, favor continuing the current strategy of building broad appeal, which led to a record four parliamentary seats in the last election. The contest forces the party to decide whether to stick with its proven formula or adopt a more radical style.</p>

          <p>World number three Iga Swiatek has advanced to the final of the Cincinnati Open after a decisive straight-set victory over Elena Rybakina. The reigning Wimbledon champion will now face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in a rematch of last year's French Open final, which Swiatek won convincingly. Rybakina, who had defeated the world number one in the previous round, was unable to maintain her momentum against Swiatek's powerful performance. Paolini secured her spot in the final after a hard-fought three-set win against Veronika Kudermetova, capitalizing on her opponent's numerous unforced errors.</p>

          <p>Spanish golfer Jon Rahm has won the LIV Golf individual season championship for the second year in a row. He secured the title despite losing a playoff to Sebastian Munoz at the event in Indiana. Rahm's performance was strong enough to fend off his closest season-long competitor, Joaquin Niemann, earning him the top prize of $18 million. The result also had positive implications for European Ryder Cup veterans Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both performed well enough to avoid relegation from the LIV tour for the 2026 season.</p>

This trend, particularly pronounced among lower-income households, helps explain continued strong consumer spending amid persistent inflation.
