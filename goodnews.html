          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has reached the quarter-finals of the Washington Open by defeating four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka in a decisive 6-4, 6-2 victory. This win follows her earlier upset of the seventh-seeded Marta Kostyuk, continuing her strong performance in the tournament. Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, is set to face Maria Sakkari in the next round. In the men's singles, however, British players Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans were both eliminated in the last 16, ending their runs in the Washington D.C. tournament.</p>

          <h2>Film Review: 'Oh, Hi!' Explores Modern Romance and Commitment-Phobia</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new romantic comedy-thriller "Oh, Hi!" stars Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman as a couple whose relationship unravels during a weekend getaway. The film critiques the modern "softboy" archetype through Lerman's character, Isaac, who avoids commitment while feigning deep emotional connection, leading to a tense, hostage-like situation orchestrated by his frustrated girlfriend, Iris. This article reviews the movie, praising the performances of Gordon and co-star Geraldine Viswanathan but noting that the script struggles to define Iris's character consistently. The film serves as a commentary on gender tropes and the difficulties of communication in contemporary relationships, making it a relevant, if sometimes uneven, watch.</p>

          <h2>Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers Announces He Will Not Seek a Third Term in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:54:43 EDT</div>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after five decades in public service, the 73-year-old's decision opens a major contest in the key battleground state. His tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, and by his successful push for new legislative maps that are more favorable to Democrats. The announcement is expected to trigger a competitive primary for both parties ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Temporarily Preserves Key Voting Rights Act Enforcement Mechanism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:52:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on a lower court ruling that would have significantly weakened the Voting Rights Act. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that private individuals and groups cannot sue under Section 2 of the act, a decision that would limit enforcement to only the U.S. Justice Department. This case originated from a lawsuit by two tribal nations in North Dakota challenging a redistricting plan. The Supreme Court's pause allows the current, more favorable voting map to remain for now, but the larger question of who can bring such lawsuits could be taken up for a full review, potentially further eroding the landmark civil rights law.</p>

          <p>Industrial firm Dover reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $2.05 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share. Despite these positive figures and a raised full-year outlook, the company's stock price declined. This article argues that investors are overlooking key strengths, including record-high profit margins, accelerating order bookings, and strategic investments in high-growth areas like data center cooling and biopharma. The analysis posits that the company's portfolio restructuring is creating a stronger, higher-margin business for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he does not intend to "destroy" Elon Musk's companies by revoking their government subsidies, seeking to quell speculation amid a public feud between the two figures. In a Truth Social post, Trump said he wants all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to "THRIVE like never before." The statement follows a period of escalating tensions, which included Trump threatening to cut government contracts with Musk's companies like SpaceX and Tesla. These companies receive substantial benefits from federal contracts and regulatory credits, making the administration's stance a significant factor in their financial outlook.</p>

          <p>England has established a strong position in the fourth Test against India, driven by a powerful performance from both its batters and bowlers. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helping to dismiss India for 358. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley (84) and Ben Duckett (94) launched a blistering attack, putting on a 166-run partnership. The day also featured a dramatic return by India's Rishabh Pant, who batted despite a suspected broken foot. At the close of play, England was 225-2, trailing by just 133 runs and looking poised to win the series.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is firmly focused on the upcoming season, stating he has "moved on" from the team's Super Bowl LIX victory five months ago. Despite being named the game's MVP, Hurts emphasized that the championship is in the past and that he is not even wearing his new Super Bowl ring. He shared that he and his teammates are adopting a mindset of proving themselves all over again, rather than dwelling on being "defending champions." This forward-looking attitude, echoed by Coach Nick Sirianni, sets a tone of renewed hunger and focus as the Eagles begin their training camp for the new season.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is rapidly increasing, with AI-related job postings growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years. A recent report from the Brookings Institution shows that these postings more than doubled in the last year alone, as more companies integrate AI into their operations. These roles range from specialized AI engineers to more general positions in fields like marketing and finance that now require AI competency. On average, jobs that list AI skills pay about 28% more than similar roles without that requirement, signaling a significant shift in the labor market.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is a better place to park $25,000 in the current economic climate. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% APY would earn approximately $18 more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30% APY. The primary advantage of the CD is its fixed rate, which guarantees the return and protects against potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, the article advises that the decision should depend on individual financial needs, recommending the more liquid high-yield savings account for those without a robust emergency fund.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has walked back its plan to phase out paper checks, confirming it will continue to issue them for beneficiaries who have no other way to receive payments. The agency had previously announced a full transition to electronic deposits by October, citing cost savings and security. The reversal followed a meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, where Warren raised concerns about the impact on the approximately 600,000 Americans, many of whom are unbanked, who still rely on paper checks. The SSA will continue to promote the benefits of electronic payments but will not force the switch.</p>

          <p>Erik and Karin Vonk, a Dutch couple, have turned a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most celebrated craft distilleries. Located on a 70-acre estate, their distillery is among the few in the world that produces rum directly from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses, a distinction they credit for their spirit's high quality. Their success is part of a broader "rum renaissance" in the U.S., with Georgia's craft distilling scene growing after legislative changes in 2017 allowed direct-to-consumer sales. The Vonks' hands-on approach, from growing their own sugarcane to aging rum for up to a decade, has built a nationally recognized brand.</p>
