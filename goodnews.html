          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the majority of global tariffs implemented by former President Donald Trump are illegal, a decision that could impact a key foreign policy tool. The court rejected the argument that the tariffs were permissible under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, stating that imposing them is a core power of Congress, not the president. The ruling, which affects tariffs on countries including China, Mexico, and Canada, is not expected to take immediate effect, as the case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The European football transfer market is active with several major clubs negotiating significant deals before the deadline. Liverpool is reportedly preparing a record-breaking £130 million offer for Newcastle's striker Alexander Isak, while Manchester United has allegedly agreed to a loan-to-buy deal for Rasmus Hojlund with Napoli. Other notable discussions include Brentford's rejected £45 million bid for German forward Maximilian Beier and Marseille's interest in Arsenal's Oleksandr Zinchenko.

          <p>China is overhauling its network of state key laboratories to better serve its national strategic agenda, particularly in its technological competition with the West. The restructured program, which now includes around 500 labs, emphasizes clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's goals for scientific supremacy. During a ceremony in Hong Kong, Science and Technology Minister Yin Hejun highlighted the new vision, urging the city's revamped labs to contribute directly to national development through innovation. This shift marks a move away from loosely defined research towards mission-oriented scientific advancement.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the controversy surrounding the cover art for her new album, "Man’s Best Friend," which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet. In a recent interview, Carpenter dismissed the criticism, stating that the image was not a topic of concern among her inner circle and that her intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it. Amid the backlash, she released an alternative, "God-approved" cover but defended the original as an artistic choice meant for her fans, not for external critics.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1 billion for its upcoming Saturday night drawing after no grand prize winner emerged from Wednesday's drawing. This marks the sixth time in the game's history that the jackpot has reached the billion-dollar threshold, with a current estimated cash value of $453.1 million. The last Powerball jackpot was won on May 31, and the prize has been growing since. A potential winner would face the choice between a lump sum payment or an annuity paid out over 30 years, both before taxes.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, has embarked on a 105-mile solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The five-day protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to inaction by state Republicans. Kenyatta argues that the funding crisis, which has already led to service reductions affecting students and workers, is a result of misplaced priorities by GOP legislators. He is framing his march as part of a long-standing American tradition of protest for essential services.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 individuals from Venezuela. The court upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful because the governing statute does not permit the Homeland Security Secretary to vacate a prior extension of TPS. This decision preserves the legal status that allows these individuals to live and work in the U.S. while the legal challenge continues, insulating them from shifting political decisions.</p>

Several Democratic retirements have created potential openings for the GOP, while contentious primaries are developing on both sides. Races in North Carolina and Texas are expected to be particularly expensive and hard-fought, setting the stage for a high-stakes election cycle.</p>

The administrative law judge denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to separate the inquiry into claims practices from the rate review.
