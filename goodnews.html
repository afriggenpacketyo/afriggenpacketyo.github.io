          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero after he jumped from a Disney Cruise Line ship to save his child who had fallen overboard. The incident occurred as the Disney Dream was returning to Fort Lauderdale from the Bahamas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell to 2.0% in June, an unexpected decrease that aligns with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the eurozone. This development has pleased the ECB, which may consider another interest rate cut later this year. While the data suggests inflation is stabilizing, economists warn that persistent service inflation and volatile global energy prices could still pose risks to this trend. The overall eurozone inflation data is anticipated to confirm this disinflationary path, though external factors remain a significant variable. (not investment advice)</p>

Lee stated that the move is driven by the growth of stablecoins, the majority of which transact on the Ethereum blockchain.

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder James Wood achieved a rare statistical feat by being intentionally walked four times in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels. This marks the first time a player has been given four intentional passes since Barry Bonds in 2004. The strategy reflects the significant threat Wood poses at the plate, having already hit 22 home runs this season. Despite the opposition's efforts to pitch around him, Wood still managed a hit and a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national team advanced to the Concacaf Gold Cup semi-finals after a tense penalty-shootout victory over Costa Rica. Despite fielding an experimental squad and facing an early deficit, the team demonstrated resilience and character that has often been missing. After a 2-2 draw, goalkeeper Matt Freese made three crucial saves in the shootout to secure the win. The article suggests that overcoming such adversity is more valuable for this developing team than simply winning the trophy, as it helps rebuild a positive culture and provides priceless experience under pressure for a younger group of players.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results pave the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for both this stand-alone vaccine and its combination Covid-19 and flu shot. The company voluntarily withdrew its application for the combo vaccine earlier, pending this new data, following discussions with the FDA. If approved, these products could significantly impact the multibillion-dollar markets for respiratory virus vaccines and simplify vaccination for patients.</p>

A DAF allows individuals to set aside money for charity, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then distribute the funds to non-profits over time. GoFundMe's CEO, Tim Cadogan, aims to make this financial tool more accessible and efficient for everyday users, moving beyond the platform's reputation for immediate, reactive fundraising. The company hopes this will help increase overall charitable contributions, which have long remained stagnant in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

However, other major firms, including J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, have expressed caution, initiating coverage with neutral or underweight ratings due to the stock's elevated valuation. Circle's share price has more than doubled since its debut, prompting concerns that its current price may be too high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by historian Greg Grandin, "America, Am√©rica," challenges the conventional view of U.S.-Latin American relations, arguing the U.S. has much to learn from its southern neighbors. The article highlights that while the U.S. has often intervened in the region under a paternalistic guise, many Latin American nations have a rich history of social movements grounded in collective ideals. From the outset, their constitutions often enshrined social rights, such as the common good and aid for the destitute, concepts absent from the U.S. Constitution. This history offers a powerful counter-narrative and a potential model for strengthening democracy.</p>

A key to its success has been a disciplined strategy of operating its own restaurants rather than franchising, allowing for greater control over quality and efficiency, and leading to exceptionally high average sales per location.</p>
