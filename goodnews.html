          <p>Amazon has confirmed that it is laying off approximately 100 employees within its devices and services division, which includes Alexa, Echo, Ring, and Zoox. The company cited efforts to operate more efficiently and better align with its product roadmap as reasons for the cuts. This move is part of a broader cost-cutting initiative led by CEO Andy Jassy, which has resulted in 27,000 layoffs since 2022, with other tech companies like Microsoft also trimming their workforces in similar efforts to reduce management layers and increase efficiency. Amazon continues to hire within the devices and services division despite the layoffs.</p>

The proposed bill includes extensions to Trump's 2017 tax cuts, temporary measures to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, and cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies to offset the bill's $3.8 trillion cost. While House leaders express confidence in passing the bill before the Memorial Day recess, conservative lawmakers argue the Medicaid cuts don't go far enough, and Republicans from high-tax states are dissatisfied with the state and local tax deduction provisions.</p>
