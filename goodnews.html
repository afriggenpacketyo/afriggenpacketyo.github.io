          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the CIF track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in the high jump and triple jump, and placing second in the long jump.

The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation following the policy change, and protests occurred during the finals, with some denouncing Hernandez's participation. Some high school coaches voiced their support for Hernandez, emphasizing the importance of grace and understanding, and the article highlights the varying perspectives on the debate surrounding transgender athletes in sports.

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing the pardon she received for her role in the January 6th U.S. Capitol Insurrection, stating that she believes she and others involved were guilty of wrongdoing. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, is working with her Republican senator to formally refuse the pardon, which she sees as contributing to a false narrative. She argues that accepting the pardon would be hypocritical, and she contrasts her stance with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons.

          <p>South Korea is holding an election to choose a successor to President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached after attempting to orchestrate a military takeover. The election is viewed as an opportunity to heal the fractures caused by the martial law crisis, with the leading opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, campaigning in a bullet-proof vest due to death threats. The ruling party's candidate, Kim Moon-soo, has struggled due to his association with the disgraced former president, turning the election into a referendum on martial law. Lee has gained support by promising to prevent future attempts to declare martial law and has shifted his policies to the right to attract centrist voters. The article summarizes the election.</p>
