          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 06:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan for a new US missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," is drawing both support and criticism. Modeled after Israel's Iron Dome, the system aims to protect against aerial threats, including those from outer space, at an estimated cost of $175 billion. While the Pentagon cites growing threats from Russia and China as justification, critics question the project's feasibility and cost. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has already condemned the plan, raising concerns about its impact on global strategic stability. Canada has expressed interest in potentially collaborating on the project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. This move aims to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following local opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes. The initiative is part of Japan's broader effort to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal after the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>

          <p>As Major League Soccer celebrates its 30th season, it faces challenges related to media exposure, competition, and potential calendar changes. The article suggests MLS could learn from Japan's J League, which prioritized player development and strong local relationships. J League chairman Yoshikazu Nonomura emphasizes their focus on creating a professional pathway for young players. The J League has successfully rebuilt its crowds post-Iniesta by increasing media investments and developing a unified ticketing system. Nonomura believes both leagues can learn from each other and potentially rank among the world's best.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are exploring a new method to track the world's biodiversity by collecting and analyzing DNA from the air. Researchers are using air quality monitoring stations to capture environmental DNA (eDNA), providing a broad overview of species present in a given area. This approach could help monitor conservation efforts, identify invasive species, and detect pathogens. The technique offers a scalable and cost-effective way to assess biodiversity on a national and potentially global scale, complementing traditional methods.</p>

          <p>Germany and Nigeria have pledged to enhance their partnership in areas such as economy, energy, and migration. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized Nigeria's importance as a key partner in Africa, highlighting opportunities for economic cooperation, particularly in rare earths. Discussions also focused on managing migration flows to Europe. Nigeria aims to export talent rather than people, seeking structured solutions for job creation and addressing irregular migration in collaboration with Germany. Nigeria is Germany's second-largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

          <p>Wang Jian, a prominent Chinese AI scholar, is advocating for greater use of artificial intelligence in space exploration, particularly within the context of Zhejiang Lab's plan to build a constellation of 1,000 satellites. The satellites are designed to process data in orbit, enhancing computing efficiency compared to Earth-based processing. Wang envisions AI playing a crucial role in space, emphasizing the need to consider its potential applications in the next few decades. The Three-Body Computing Constellation aims to achieve a computing power of 1,000 petaflops.</p>

          <p>Frictions between China and the European Union over electric vehicles are not "existential", according to John Clarke, a former EU trade negotiator. Clarke suggests both sides are looking to work more closely together on trade and the green transition, particularly to counteract the disruption caused by US President Donald Trump. He identifies potential collaboration areas such as energy, space, pandemic preparedness, and the green transition, noting the EU needs Chinese environmental technology and goods to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the example of Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, noting his decision to step aside is increasingly rare in an era of aging politicians and judges. French argues that powerful people often cling to power, enabled by those who benefit from their positions. He contrasts this with Souter, who valued his life beyond the court and understood the importance of allowing the next generation to take its turn. French emphasizes the need for leaders to prioritize kindness and humility over ambition.</p>
