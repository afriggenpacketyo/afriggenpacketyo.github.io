          <p>A CBS News crew gained access to Tehran following a ceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict, observing a city slowly recovering from Israeli strikes. The crew's 14-hour journey from the Turkish border was marked by checkpoints and poor road conditions, highlighting the challenges of access. Despite the ceasefire, Iranian airspace was partially closed, necessitating the long drive. While some residents have fled, others are venturing out, with cafes and restaurants reopening in places like Firdous Park, but life remains far from normal as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remains out of sight, leaving many Iranians uncertain about the future. The article reveals that while Iranians may have diverse opinions about the regime, they share a united sentiment regarding their country. </p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks selected Cooper Flagg, an 18-year-old sensation from Duke, as the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, marking a new era for the team. Flagg, a consensus college player of the year, will join a roster already featuring Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. This pick follows the Mavericks' controversial trade of Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, a move that initially sparked fan protests and pessimism. However, winning the NBA Draft Lottery with a slim chance allowed the Mavericks to secure Flagg, offering hope for the team's future and a chance to turn the page on the Doncic era.</p>

He emphasized that protecting teammates is a natural reaction when tensions rise, and such incidents can galvanize a team. Hoffman also highlighted the importance of pitching inside but doing so responsibly to avoid escalating conflicts, as the two teams are set to face off again in August.</p>

          <p>Emily Eavis, organizer of Glastonbury Festival, describes the unique atmosphere of the festival's first two days, particularly the "Thursday feeling" when the site reaches capacity. She likens the opening of the gates to "letting people into Christmas," emphasizing the excitement and anticipation as attendees reunite with friends and immerse themselves in the festival experience. Eavis recalls her childhood memories of the festival, noting that the "look in their eyes" of attendees has remained consistent over the years: a mix of cheer, determination, excitement, and a sense of magic. The festival's opening is a moment of release and community, distinct from the main stage performances later in the week.</p>

          <p>A controversial project to create synthetic human DNA has begun, funded by an initial ¬£10 million grant from the Wellcome Trust. The research aims to accelerate treatments for incurable diseases by building the building blocks of human life from scratch. While proponents see potential for therapies to improve aging and create disease-resistant cells, critics fear the project could lead to designer babies or unforeseen genetic modifications. The project, known as the Synthetic Human Genome Project, marks a significant leap forward from the Human Genome Project, enabling scientists to create DNA rather than just read it.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have developed a test to identify women with abnormal womb linings, which increases the risk of miscarriage, offering hope for new treatments. The test measures signs of healthy or defective reactions in the womb lining, which is crucial for embryo implantation and development. The test is being piloted to help over 1,000 patients at Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research, offering an explanation for recurrent miscarriage in some cases. One woman, Charlie Beattie, successfully carried a pregnancy to term after treatment based on the test results, highlighting the potential of this research.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter has responded to criticism of her original album cover for "Man‚Äôs Best Friend" by releasing an alternative cover.

The alternative cover features Carpenter in an elegant gown leaning against a man in a suit, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe, offering a more traditional and sophisticated image. Carpenter has faced controversy before, including backlash from the Catholic Church for filming a music video at a church, but maintains that her brand is not solely based on sex.</p>

He criticizes the Democratic establishment for relying on wealthy donors and ignoring the struggles of ordinary Americans. Sanders highlights Mamdani's progressive policy proposals, such as taxing the wealthy, rent control, free public transportation, and publicly owned grocery stores, as evidence of a winning strategy that prioritizes the needs of working people.</p>

          <p>The European Union has launched an antitrust investigation into Mars' proposed acquisition of Kellanova, the maker of Pringles, due to concerns about potential price hikes for consumers. The EU's preliminary assessment indicates that the deal could increase Mars' bargaining power against EU retailers, leading to higher prices. EU competition chief Teresa Ribera emphasized the importance of ensuring that the acquisition does not further drive up the cost of shopping baskets, especially amid inflation and high food prices. Mars defended the acquisition, saying it would deliver more choice and innovation to consumers, but the EU's investigation will assess the deal's impact on product prices.</p>

The allegations involve Jeff Shell, a former NBCUniversal chief executive who is part of Skydance's bidding team, attempting to depress the value of "South Park" streaming rights. The creators claim Shell contacted executives at Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery to lower their bids for the show, potentially depriving Paramount of higher licensing fees.
