          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will be honored with a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power on January 6, 2021. Pence resisted pressure from Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, a decision that placed him in the crosshairs of rioters at the Capitol. The award recognizes individuals who have taken principled stands, even when facing criticism and falling popularity. Since leaving office, Pence has largely been ostracized by Trump and the Republican Party, but has continued to advocate for conservative principles.</p>
