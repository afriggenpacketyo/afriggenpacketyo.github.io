          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold intense ministerial-level tariff discussions around mid-May, following "progress" in initial talks. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief negotiator, highlighted the deepening discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade expansion, and economic security cooperation. Japan is expected to offer proposals including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans to offset decreased exports to China, and simplifying import screening for U.S. cars. The Trump administration's tariffs on goods imported from Japan are currently paused until early July, but Japan continues to face universal tariffs and sector-based levies.

          <p>ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith is considering a potential presidential run in 2028, citing concerns about the state of the nation. While initially dismissing the idea, Smith has left the door open, stating his decision hinges on the country's condition and his chances of winning. Former WNBA star Chiney Ogwumike highlighted Smith's debate skills as a potential advantage, while President Trump expressed support for Smith's potential bid, praising his entertainment skills and intelligence. Smith has indicated that he will assess the political landscape in late 2026 or 2027 to determine if he has a legitimate shot at winning the presidency.</p>

          <p>China has announced it is considering U.S. overtures to begin trade negotiations, potentially opening the door for talks to resolve the ongoing trade war. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly reached out multiple times, seeking to initiate discussions on tariffs. China reiterated its demand for the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs as a sign of sincerity, warning that failure to do so would undermine mutual trust. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on imported Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory levies from China, with both sides granting exemptions on critical products.</p>

          <p>Fires that have ravaged central Israel have largely been extinguished, according to the country's Fire and Rescue Authority.

While the blazes are largely under control, authorities warn of potential flare-ups due to hot, dry conditions and strong winds. Several countries, including France, Italy, and Spain, dispatched aircraft to assist in the emergency, and a major highway linking Jerusalem and Tel Aviv has now reopened.</p>

          <p>With birth rates declining, many couples are opting for a child-free life, despite proposals for financial incentives to encourage parenthood. Reasons vary from lifestyle choices to concerns about climate change and career priorities. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that this decision often reflects a prioritization of the relationship with a partner. While some individuals may have moments of doubt, the choice to remain child-free is typically made with careful consideration and is a personal decision.</p>

While Apple will continue to produce most of its products in China for markets outside the U.S., the company's sales in China have declined amid increased competition from domestic manufacturers.

The tax, approved by voters in November, applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, while opponents argue it unfairly burdens working families. The tax excludes certain beverages, such as those for medical use and 100% natural juices.</p>

While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to diversify production even in specialized categories over time.
