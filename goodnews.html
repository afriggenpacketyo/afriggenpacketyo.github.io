          <p>The UK and US governments have unveiled a landmark agreement to accelerate the development and deployment of modular nuclear reactors in Britain, promising thousands of jobs and enhanced energy security. This "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy" aims to halve the licensing time for nuclear projects to about two years by accepting each other's safety checks. Key commercial deals include Centrica partnering with X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, generating power for 1.5 million homes and creating 2,500 jobs. The initiative also seeks to eliminate reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028, positioning both nations at the forefront of nuclear innovation.</p>

          <p>Jeff Hiller's unexpected Emmy win for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for "Somebody Somewhere" resonated deeply within Hollywood, symbolizing the arduous journey many character actors face. His visibly stunned reaction and heartfelt acceptance speech underscored his decades-long struggle for recognition, contrasting with more mainstream nominees. The article highlights how Hiller's win and the themes of his show—fostering community and finding warmth amidst isolation—spoke to a broader industry sentiment. His speech, thanking HBO for a show about "sweaty, middle-aged people" on the same network as "sexy teens," humorously yet poignantly captured the industry's often overlooked realities.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his major league-leading 54th home run of the season, a feat that ties Mickey Mantle's 1961 record for most home runs by a switch-hitter. This remarkable achievement occurred during an 11-2 victory against the Los Angeles Angels, a win that propelled the Mariners into sole possession of first place in the American League West. Raleigh, who expressed humility about the record, remains intently focused on helping his team end their division title drought, which dates back to 2001. Manager Dan Wilson praised Raleigh's all-around contributions and winning attitude, highlighting his significant offensive and defensive impact on the team's success.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, praising his courage, urgency, and optimism for New York City's future. Despite past disagreements, Hochul stated she found Mamdani committed to neighborhood safety and affordability, and resolute in confronting Donald Trump's agenda. The endorsement from the moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist, who has recently softened some past positions, including apologizing for calling the NYPD "racist." This move aims to unify the Democratic party ahead of the mayoral race, where Mamdani faces incumbent Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, both running as independents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing the vaccine, which has shown to reduce infection, prevent disease progression, and even reverse existing symptoms in wild and captive koalas. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and current antibiotic treatments are not always effective. This approval by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority offers significant hope for the conservation of koala populations, particularly in areas with high infection rates.</p>
