          <p>Retirees relying on Social Security face significant challenges when dealing with high-interest credit card debt, as their fixed incomes often struggle to keep up with rising costs. This article explores whether individuals on Social Security can qualify for debt relief programs, noting that while they often meet financial hardship criteria, their limited capacity for repayment can be a hurdle. It outlines several potential strategies, such as debt management plans, settlement programs, and credit card hardship programs, which may be more suitable for those on a fixed income. The piece emphasizes that while options exist, they must be carefully chosen to align with the financial realities of retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American hostage freed from Hamas captivity after nearly 16 months, is publicly advocating for a new agreement to secure the release of the approximately 50 hostages still held in Gaza. Alongside his wife Aviva, who was released earlier, Siegel emphasizes that previous agreements led to their freedom and another is essential to bring the remaining captives home. The couple has become prominent advocates, using their platform to keep the world's attention on the ongoing crisis. Their call for a deal comes amid complex negotiations and debates within Israel over the future of Gaza and the handling of the war.</p>

          <h2>Delta and United Airlines Emerge as Leaders in a Challenging Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:03:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are distinguishing themselves from competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong brand loyalty, extensive global networks, and a strategic focus on premium and international travel, which have proven resilient even as domestic demand for economy seats weakens. While both carriers have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, their emphasis on higher-margin premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs provides a buffer against falling airfares. This strategy allows them to thrive while other airlines struggle to remain profitable, even during peak travel seasons.</p>

          <h2>Remembering Poet Andrea Gibson's Approach to Accessible and Emotional Verse</h2>

          <p>This article pays tribute to Andrea Gibson, the late poet laureate of Colorado, celebrating their unique contribution to contemporary poetry through spoken-word performance and social media. Gibson was known for their intensely confessional and emotional style, addressing topics like queerness, anxiety, and love with a straightforwardness that made their work highly accessible and shareable. While some might view this style as overly sentimental, the article argues that Gibson's focus on connecting with a broad audience was a strength, allowing them to spread a message of empathy and gentleness far beyond traditional poetry circles. Their work resonated deeply with many who encountered it online and in performance.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Reports 30% Reduction in Spending on Asylum Seeker Hotels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:56:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has reduced its spending on hotels for asylum seekers by nearly a third, from £3 billion to £2.1 billion in the last fiscal year. According to newly published Home Office accounts, this saving was achieved primarily by moving asylum seekers into cheaper forms of accommodation, such as shared housing, and by renegotiating contracts. The average nightly cost per person has consequently dropped significantly. However, experts warn that the recent surge in small boat crossings since March could reverse this trend and lead to a renewed reliance on more expensive hotel accommodations in the near future.</p>

          <p>Following a significant 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, financial analysts are defending the company, with Jefferies upgrading its rating to a 'buy'. The sell-off was triggered by a slight reduction in the company's growth outlook, which analysts and CEO Robert Ford have described as an "overreaction" to a transitory headwind in its diagnostics business in China. Analysts maintain that the company's fundamentals remain strong and see potential for accelerated growth in 2026. The defense from the financial community helped the stock rally the following day, signaling renewed confidence in its long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study has revealed how invasive Burmese pythons are able to completely digest their prey, including the bones. Researchers identified a previously unknown type of cell in the snakes' intestines that is responsible for processing the massive influx of calcium from a consumed skeleton. These specialized cells manage the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, preventing a potentially harmful overload in the snake's bloodstream while allowing for the full digestion of its meal. This discovery helps explain how the pythons, which are a major threat to native wildlife in Florida, can consume animals larger than their own body mass.</p>

Usyk, who weighed in at a career-heavy 16st 3lb, repeatedly stepped in front of Dubois on stage, blocking him from the crowd and drawing cheers from his supporters. Dubois, who weighed 17st 6lb, appeared perturbed by the antics but stated he is focused and will win by any means necessary. The rematch at Wembley Stadium follows their previous encounter in 2023, which Usyk won by a ninth-round stoppage, making this a highly anticipated contest in the boxing world.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a major stake in the vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the lucrative Stabroek Block. Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it affirms standard industry practice that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. While Exxon disagreed with the ruling, it stated it will respect the decision and welcomed Chevron to the joint venture.</p>

          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that U.S. consumers' short-term and long-term inflation expectations have fallen to their lowest levels since February, before new tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year forecast also declined. This suggests consumers believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary, though the report notes that expectations still remain above late 2024 levels, indicating perceived risk. The data is seen as an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve, as well-anchored inflation expectations are a crucial factor in its policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is reviewed as a neo-Western thriller that masterfully captures the paranoia, misinformation, and outrage that flourished online during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The movie is set in a small New Mexico town where the lines between online conspiracy and offline reality blur, leading to real-world violence. The review praises the film's visual style, which integrates social media feeds and online content to create a sense of overwhelming digital noise. While described as nasty and cynical, the film is lauded for its eerily accurate portrayal of how digital life dominated and distorted reality during a period of intense social isolation.</p>

Contrary to the popular narrative that Richard III had his young nephews murdered, Langley's decade-long research project suggests both princes survived. Her team uncovered documents she argues are proofs of life, including evidence that a pretender to the throne, Lambert Simnel, was in fact the elder prince, Edward V. While her thesis challenges centuries of accepted history, it has been met with skepticism from some historians who find the traditional account more plausible.</p>
