          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported that its experimental daily obesity pill demonstrated significant weight loss in a late-stage trial, comparable to its popular Wegovy injection. The study found patients experienced an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks, a result that caused the company's shares to jump over 5%. This development positions Novo Nordisk to offer a crucial alternative for patients averse to injections and intensifies the competition with rivals like Eli Lilly, who are also developing oral weight-loss treatments. The pill is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a decision expected later this year.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team has received a major boost as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is set to return for their World Cup semi-final match against France. The reigning World Player of the Year has recovered from a concussion that sidelined her during the quarter-final victory over Scotland. Her return, along with that of prop Hannah Botterman, strengthens a formidable England side that is on a 31-match winning streak. The match against France is anticipated to be England's toughest challenge yet in the tournament, as they seek to avenge their 2022 final defeat and claim their first World Cup title since 2014.</p>

          <p>A new conservative organization, the Safety and Prosperity Oversight Coalition, has launched with the stated goal of promoting transparency, good governance, and conservative values. Led by veteran Republican political operative Chris Zeller, the group aims to hold both governmental institutions and the private sector accountable through audits, legal challenges, and public education campaigns. The coalition will focus on scrutinizing government spending and addressing corporate and public sector misconduct. The organization's launch is seen by some as a strategic effort to create a right-leaning counterpart to the influential watchdog groups on the left, aiming to apply similar pressure on major American institutions.</p>

The experience, which includes a private six-person dinner and a tour of Singapore's National Gallery, was sold at the museum's 10th-anniversary gala. The funds raised will support the gallery's mission to make art more accessible. The high-value bid reflects a common fundraising practice of auctioning meals with prominent business leaders, famously exemplified by the annual charity lunch with investor Warren Buffett, which once sold for over $19 million.</p>

          <p>Coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit, the UK government has announced it has secured £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. companies, which is anticipated to create over 7,600 jobs. The pledges include significant contributions from tech giants like Microsoft and Google, as well as a £90 billion investment from private equity firm Blackstone over the next decade. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the investments as a testament to Britain's economic strength. However, the announcement comes amid concerns about slowing domestic business investment and recent decisions by major pharmaceutical firms to halt UK investment plans, citing a challenging business environment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK has been marked by both royal pageantry and high-stakes political discussions. After being hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle for a lavish banquet, the president is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at his country estate, Chequers. The agenda for their talks includes finalizing a UK-US trade deal and addressing geopolitical issues. This visit is historically unusual, as U.S. presidents are not typically offered a second state visit, but the invitation was extended by the King on the advice of the government to further diplomatic and economic ties.</p>

          <h2>Huawei Unveils New AI Chip Systems to Challenge Nvidia's Market Dominance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has announced a new lineup of powerful AI computing systems powered by its in-house Ascend chips, directly challenging U.S. rival Nvidia. The company plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, which will group over 500,000 chips to overcome the limitations imposed by U.S. sanctions on advanced semiconductors. A company executive claimed the new system would deliver significantly more computing power than Nvidia's planned offerings. This move underscores China's strategic push for self-reliance in critical chip technologies and intensifies the global competition for leadership in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market.</p>

          <p>Nscale, a London-based AI infrastructure startup that emerged from stealth only last year, has rapidly become a central player in the European AI market. The company has secured nearly $700 million in fresh capital from Nvidia and has been named a key partner for major AI buildouts by Microsoft and OpenAI in the UK and Norway. Nscale's swift ascent is part of Europe's push for "sovereign AI," aiming to keep data and processing within the continent. The company, which provides a full-stack service of data centers, power, and GPUs, is now positioned as a potential "national champion" for AI infrastructure in the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Delaware have successfully developed a synthetic version of a molecule found in the guava fruit plant that shows promise in fighting liver cancer. The natural compound, present in the plant's leaves and bark, has known anti-cancer properties, but sourcing it naturally is not viable for mass production. By using a process called natural product total synthesis, scientists created a chemical "recipe" to replicate the molecule from widely available materials. This breakthrough could pave the way for developing more effective and accessible treatments for liver cancer, a disease with a low long-term survival rate.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City icon Kevin de Bruyne is set to make his return to the Etihad Stadium as his new club, Napoli, faces his old team in a Champions League match. The Belgian midfielder, who won 16 trophies during his decade at City, left in June after his contract expired and has since become a star player for the Italian champions. De Bruyne's arrival in Naples has been compared to that of Diego Maradona, and he has already scored two goals in his first three games. The match promises an emotional reception for the 34-year-old, who will be aiming to lead his in-form Napoli side to victory against his former club.</p>
