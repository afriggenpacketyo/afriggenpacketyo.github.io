          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a significant legislative package central to the Trump administration's agenda. Speaker Mike Johnson championed the bill, framing it as a pivotal moment that delivers on Republican promises and improves American lives, contrasting it with what he called Democratic "performances." The bill, referred to as the "big, beautiful bill," is now expected to be signed into law by the president. This legislative action follows a record-breaking speech by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries opposing the measure.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000, the initial monthly payments for a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) are currently almost identical due to similar average interest rates. However, the long-term cost can vary significantly because home equity loans typically have fixed rates, ensuring predictable payments. In contrast, HELOCs have variable rates that fluctuate with market conditions, which can lead to cheaper or more expensive payments over time. Homeowners are advised to consider their risk tolerance for this volatility before choosing a product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A majority of Germans support tightening laws around alcohol consumption for teenagers, according to a recent survey. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe the practice of allowing 14-year-olds to drink beer or wine with a guardian should be banned. Furthermore, just over half support raising the legal age for purchasing beer and wine from 16 to 18. This sentiment aligns with calls from doctors' associations and politicians to address the health risks associated with early alcohol consumption, as the country grapples with high rates of alcohol addiction.</p>

Using the recent U.S. strike on Iran as a case study, the article points out that despite these figures' vocal opposition to the attack, polling showed overwhelming support for Trump's decision among Republican and MAGA voters. The author posits that these "intellectual architects" are merely political entrepreneurs attempting to align their own agendas with Trump's brand. Ultimately, "Trumpism" is defined solely by Trump himself, not by the pundits who claim to interpret it.</p>

          <p>The Isle of Wight rock band Wet Leg is returning with their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," which marks a significant evolution in their sound and style. In an interview, frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discusses the band's meteoric rise and how their new music is more sonically expressive and raw, reflecting their growth as touring musicians. The album's themes are heavily influenced by love, a departure from their debut, though it retains their signature tongue-in-cheek lyrical style. The band is excited to perform the new material, which they feel was made to be played live.</p>
