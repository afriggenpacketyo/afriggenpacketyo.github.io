          <p>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has publicly advocated for the Cleveland Browns to start rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, currently third on the team's depth chart. On his 'New Heights' podcast, Kelce argued that starting Sanders would generate excitement and draw viewership, despite Sanders' recent rough preseason outing. His brother and co-host, Jason Kelce, defended the Browns' decision to start veteran Joe Flacco, prioritizing the team's best chance to win. The debate follows criticism and conspiracy theories regarding Sanders' playing time and performance, with some pundits suggesting intentional obstacles are being placed before him.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier denials from owner Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys are reportedly now open to trade offers for All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons, who has been disgruntled over his contract. Parsons, who has not fully participated in practice since last season, reportedly requested a trade amidst a standoff with Jones regarding a long-term deal. The star player, currently on a fifth-year option, filed a grievance arguing he should be classified as a linebacker for a higher salary. Parsons has also removed Cowboys references from his social media, signaling his dissatisfaction with his current team situation.</p>

The 24-year-old Italian continued his impressive hard-court Grand Slam winning streak, which now stands at 23 matches. Sinner showcased an efficient performance, breaking Popyrin's serve early in each set and capitalizing on strong returns, despite a lower first-serve percentage. He closed out the match 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 in just over two hours and is set to face Canada's Denis Shapovalov in the next round, maintaining his strong form after recent victories at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Seniors to Address Medicare Insurance Coverage Gaps</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:16:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seniors and older adults are increasingly concerned about financial stability due to persistent inflation and potential Social Security issues, making it crucial to address Medicare insurance coverage gaps. Traditional Medicare often doesn't cover all medical expenses, leading to out-of-pocket costs that can accumulate. To bridge these gaps, seniors can explore options like Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap) to cover deductibles and copays, reverse mortgages for homeowners aged 62 and older to access home equity without immediate repayment, or annuities to secure a consistent future income stream. These strategies offer ways to manage healthcare costs and provide financial peace of mind (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Intel's CFO David Zinsner announced the semiconductor giant received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, part of a deal where the White House took a 10% stake in the company. The investment comes as Intel considers seeking outside investment for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other firms and has been a source of investor concern despite better-than-expected second-quarter results. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the deal is still being finalized. Intel had previously warned that the government stake could elicit 'adverse reactions' from various stakeholders, including investors and foreign governments.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, a move that could significantly influence Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak. Woltemade, a 23-year-old Germany international, is expected to undergo a medical after a deal was struck for what is rumored to be a club-record fee. This acquisition could provide Newcastle with the second quality striker they sought, potentially opening the door for Isak's departure if Liverpool increases their bid. Woltemade's impressive performance over the last year, including 17 goals for Stuttgart and top scorer at the Under-21 Euros, highlights his immense potential.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock slipped despite beating earnings expectations, as investors grappled with robust AI demand offset by ongoing uncertainty regarding its future in China. The company's sales surged 56% to $46.74 billion, with CEO Jensen Huang noting 'tremendous progress' in AI and projecting $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. However, the Trump administration's block on H20 chip sales to China and the unfinalized deal to restart sales, which could generate $2 billion to $5 billion in revenue, cast a shadow. Analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia's long-term AI growth but seek clearer guidance on its China market strategy.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have dropped to their lowest point in 2025, averaging 8.22%, making them a more attractive borrowing option alongside HELOCs.

The fixed nature of home equity loan rates provides protection against market uncertainty, unlike variable-rate products.

While early adoption has been encouraging, analysts caution that initial selection may be limited and the initiative could impact Amazon's operating income due to thin grocery margins.
