The approximately $200 million cost will be covered by the president and other private donors, with construction set to begin in September. The new venue is intended to host large state functions for up to 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds. The administration stated the design will respect the architectural heritage of the existing building.</p>

          <p>Apple announced exceptional third-quarter earnings, with overall revenue growing by 10%, its largest increase since late 2021.

Sales in China also rebounded, growing 4% after previous declines, and the services division continued its steady expansion.

          <p>Ukraine's parliament has overwhelmingly voted to overturn a controversial law that would have limited the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after thousands of young protesters demonstrated across the country for nearly a week, demanding the government reverse course on a measure they saw as a threat to Ukraine's European integration. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had initially introduced the bill, acknowledged the democratic process, effectively making a U-turn in response to the significant public pressure.</p>

          <p>After announcing she will not run for California governor, former Vice President Kamala Harris has a wide variety of options for her next chapter. Political experts suggest her path could range from another presidential run in 2028 to taking up a specific cause like Al Gore did with climate change or moving into media like the Obamas. Harris stated she is a "devout public servant" but is also willing to pursue change through "new methods and fresh thinking," leaving her future in the public eye deliberately open.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal *Cell* has solved a long-standing mystery about the origin of the potato, revealing it evolved from a tomato ancestor. Researchers found that around 9 million years ago, a hybridization event occurred between an ancient tomato and a wild potato species from Chile. This interbreeding combined a gene from the tomato parent that tells the plant to form tubers with a gene from the wild potato that controls their growth, resulting in the starchy vegetable known today.</p>
