        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among child development experts suggests limiting screen time for children, especially in early years, to foster crucial developmental skills. Recommendations range from "screen-free until three" to supervised, limited daily use for older children, emphasizing that real-world interaction, play, and imagination are vital. Experts are concerned that excessive screen use replaces time needed for developing motor skills, social interaction, and language, though they acknowledge technology can also offer benefits like educational content and maintaining social connections. Parents are encouraged to monitor content and engage with their children about their digital activities.</p>

          <p>Footballer Jack Grealish is experiencing a career revival since joining Everton on loan, delivering man-of-the-match performances and multiple assists in recent games. His impressive form has contrasted sharply with his limited playtime at Manchester City last season, leading to discussions about his potential return to the England national team under manager Thomas Tuchel. Despite his recent success and praise from Everton's manager David Moyes, Grealish was omitted from the latest England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. His resurgence has positioned him as a key player for his club.</p>

Her improved performance sets up a highly anticipated fourth-round match against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka.

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced that he was recently diagnosed with Basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. In a social media post, he shared a photo of his face bandaged after having a cancerous growth removed and thanked his medical team for their prompt action. Ramsay, 58, used the announcement as a public service message, strongly urging his followers to use sunscreen, especially over the holiday weekend. Basal cell carcinoma is typically caused by long-term exposure to UV radiation from the sun and often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen in public for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media. He was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia. The speculation was fueled by a recent interview in which Vice President J.D. Vance discussed the need to be prepared for "terrible tragedies," which some interpreted as a comment on Trump's health. Concerns had also been raised earlier in the week about a bruise on his hand, which the White House attributed to frequent handshaking.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has made an improved offer of £35 million, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause, for Crystal Palace's captain and defender, Marc Guehi. Negotiations between the two Premier League clubs are ongoing, with Palace reportedly seeking an additional £5 million in bonuses to finalize the deal before the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, prompting Palace to consider a sale rather than lose him on a free transfer next summer. The club is actively seeking to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's move to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations to enhance detection and prevention, including more frequent testing of cooling towers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can reportedly detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds beyond the range of human hearing, sending the data to an AI system trained on thousands of patient records for analysis. A large-scale study involving over 200 GP surgeries found that patients examined with the AI stethoscope were significantly more likely to receive an early diagnosis for these conditions. This innovation is being hailed as a potential game-changer for early detection and treatment of heart disease.</p>

The article notes that while the film retains the gore and blunt parody, its polished production and star-studded cast, including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood, create a different experience from the gleeful "cine-garbage" of its predecessor. The story now features a more sincere emotional core and a direct environmental message, with Dinklage playing a janitor transformed into a mutant hero.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to $1 billion for the first time in over a year, following 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This prize ranks as the sixth-largest in the game's history. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant federal and state taxes. A 24% federal tax is withheld immediately, with winners likely owing more at tax time, and most states also levy their own income taxes on the winnings. (not investment advice)</p>
