          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to a controversial remark about receiving gifted rice, which sparked public outrage. The survey also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The government plans to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers to stabilize prices and make it available at 2,000 yen per 5 kg.</p>

          <p>Ozeki Onosato won the Emperor's Cup with a 14-1 record after losing his final match to yokozuna Hoshoryu, preventing a perfect tournament. The 24-year-old had already secured consecutive championships and promotion to yokozuna prior to the final bout. The Japan Sumo Association is expected to recommend Onosato's promotion to yokozuna, making him the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, Kisenosato, in 2017. Hoshoryu's victory improved his head-to-head record against Onosato, concluding his first full meet as a grand champion after an earlier injury withdrawal.</p>
