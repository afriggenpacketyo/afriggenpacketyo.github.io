          <p>Billionaire Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, argues that President Trump's tariffs disproportionately harm working-class Americans by acting as a regressive tax. While Griffin voted for Trump and has been a megadonor to Republican politicians, he has criticized Trump's trade policy, saying it risks spoiling the United States' brand. Griffin acknowledges a modest risk of stagflation due to inflationary pressures and economic slowdown caused by higher tariffs, but the economy's trajectory depends on Trump's overall economic policy, which includes trade, tax cuts, and deregulation.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that the U.S. may announce new trade agreements soon, as the administration faces pressure to strike deals with economic partners before a 90-day pause on tariffs ends in July. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that many deals could be wrapped up by the end of the year, with negotiations underway with countries including Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. While active trade talks with China have not yet commenced, Bessent is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation for trade discussions in Switzerland.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 and intended to land on Venus, is expected to make an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict it could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, with the potential for some parts to survive re-entry due to its design to withstand Venus' atmosphere. While the risk of impact on humans is low, space debris crashing back to Earth could pose a growing problem for aircraft, prompting concerns about potential catastrophic consequences.</p>

          <p>A Kentucky woman, Holly LaFavers, was surprised to find 70,000 lollipops delivered to her doorstep after her 8-year-old son, Liam, ordered them on her phone, costing approximately $4,000. Liam intended to use the lollipops as prizes for a carnival he wanted to host for his friends. Fortunately, Amazon refunded the $4,000, and LaFavers is donating the lollipops to charity. She is also adjusting her phone settings to prevent future accidental orders.</p>
