          <p>President Trump declared on social media that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire after escalating air assaults between the two countries. The agreement, according to Trump, involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, with the war officially ending after 24 hours. However, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, later denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement but stated that if Israel halted strikes by a specific time, Iran would cease its response. The announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, escalating the conflict that began when Israel launched strikes against Iran's nuclear program, citing intelligence of Iran's nuclear weapon advancements. The article notes that this all occurred after Iran fired missiles targeting a U.S. military base in Qatar, which were intercepted. </p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran. There were no reported casualties at the base, as Qatar's air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles. The U.S. strikes were in response to what the U.S. claimed was a significant advancement by Iran toward obtaining a nuclear weapon. Simultaneously, President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, after more than a week of aerial attacks following Israel's initial strike on Iran's nuclear program. </p>

          <p>This article explores the enduring mystery of D.B. Cooper, who hijacked a Northwest Orient flight in 1971, demanding $200,000 and four parachutes before jumping from the plane and vanishing. Despite extensive investigations, neither Cooper nor the ransom money has ever been definitively found, fueling numerous theories about his identity and fate. The article delves into the perspectives of Cooper enthusiasts, including authors and podcasters, who have become captivated by the unsolved case. The article also touches on the cultural impact of the Cooper legend, including a Manhattan bar dedicated to the hijacking, and the ethical considerations surrounding the glorification of a criminal act. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, named ‚ÄúMeteor-1,‚Äù which could accelerate AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to Nvidia‚Äôs advanced GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and U.S. export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing's advantages, such as high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, position it as a critical future direction. </p>

          <p>Oil prices declined after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent fell nearly 3%, returning to levels below those before Israel attacked Iran. The market sell-off indicates investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some suggesting a "peace through strength strategy." President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the prevention of any loss of life, and called for peace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas, Oklahoma, and Nevada have recently approved changes to their laws to attract corporations, challenging Delaware's dominance as the preferred state for incorporation. These changes include diminishing shareholder powers, offering more legal protections for businesses, and creating dedicated business courts. Billionaire Elon Musk advocated for these states after a Delaware judge struck down his compensation package from Tesla, leading Tesla and SpaceX to relocate to Texas, and Neuralink to Nevada. Concerns about a potential "Dexit" have prompted Delaware to pass legislation to protect its status, limiting shareholders‚Äô access to records and increasing protections for leadership. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. The judge issued an injunction preventing the administration from enforcing a proclamation that cited national security concerns. Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to the administration‚Äôs demands regarding governance and curriculum. The administration has accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. </p>

          <p>Chongqing, China, has evolved into a hub of international trade, thanks to the launch of two cross-border rail networks. One runs west to Germany, and the other extends south to Singapore, providing faster access to global markets. Chongqing aspires to become a central node in the global economy, connecting Asia and Europe via rail. The changes in Chongqing reflect China's deepening global trade footprint amid rising geopolitical risks, including potential decoupling from the United States. </p>
