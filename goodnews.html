          <h2>SMIC Shares Decline After Revenue Misses Expectations Amid Geopolitical Shifts</h2>

          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker SMIC fell nearly 7% after its first-quarter revenue missed estimates, despite a surge in profits. The company cited 'production fluctuations' for the shortfall, expecting the impact to extend into the second quarter. SMIC's capacity utilization reached nearly 90%, reflecting strong domestic demand for semiconductors, driven by government policies and changes in geopolitics. Despite these advancements, SMIC faces limitations in producing advanced chips due to U.S.-led export controls, hindering its ability to access critical chip-making equipment, even though it appears to be making some breakthroughs.</p>

          <h2>Trump Hints at Tariff Reductions on Chinese Goods as Trade Talks Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 01:01:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that the high tariffs imposed on goods from China may be reduced as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. Trump indicated that tariffs are 'coming down' from the new import taxes of up to 145% imposed on China since his return to the White House. The upcoming meeting signals a potential de-escalation of the trade war, though analysts caution that negotiations are likely to be lengthy and any initial tariff cuts may be minor. Meanwhile, China's exports to the U.S. have fallen, but its overall exports have risen, demonstrating resilience in the face of trade tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports saw a significant increase in April, primarily fueled by a rise in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently implemented tariffs. Exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year, surpassing expectations, while imports slightly decreased. The surge in exports to ASEAN countries compensated for a 21% drop in shipments to the U.S., highlighting China's ability to adapt to trade pressures. However, analysts expect trade data to weaken in the coming months, pending potential resolutions in trade negotiations with the U.S.</p>

The Dodgers, who have played few division rivals so far, are entering a challenging stretch with multiple series against division opponents, including the Diamondbacks, Padres, and Giants.

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The agreement, described as 'historic' by both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, seeks to alleviate the burden on British industries, particularly the car industry. While some tariffs will be reduced or eliminated, a 10% levy on most goods will remain, leaving the UK in a worse position than before the trade war. The deal also includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, though the government disputes claims of a US 'veto'.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration. The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates.</p>
