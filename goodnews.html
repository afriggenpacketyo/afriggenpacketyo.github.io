          <h2>Experts Weigh in on Mortgage Rate Outlook Following Fed's June Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 09:37:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that mortgage rates are unlikely to decrease immediately following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than direct Fed policy changes, and the 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering between 4.5% and 5%. Factors such as persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target and a robust job market are not creating pressure for the Fed to cut rates. Despite this, some experts suggest that buying a home now could be advantageous due to less competition and the potential for negotiating better deals with sellers. Refinancing remains an option if rates decrease later, and home prices are expected to continue rising. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Chip Roy is advocating for legislation that would grant Congress greater authority over federal spending, inspired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The proposed bill would provide lawmakers with real-time access to Treasury Department invoices exceeding $25,000, as well as data on payments to federal benefit recipients and employees. Roy asserts that this legislation would enable Congress to identify and address wasteful spending, continuing the mission of DOGE. This initiative follows Musk's departure from his government role and his criticism of congressional spending measures. The bill aims to enhance transparency and accountability in federal spending.</p>

          <h2>Private Equity Leaders Express Optimism About European Investment Opportunities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 09:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private equity bosses are increasingly optimistic about investment opportunities in Europe, reversing the negative sentiment from the previous year. This shift is attributed to factors such as falling interest rates, Germany's fiscal package, and increased political stability in countries like France, Germany, and the U.K. Despite lackluster appetite from institutional investors and subdued dealmaking, some executives believe that shifting money into Europe is a sound strategy. This optimism contrasts with concerns about volatile policymaking in the U.S., suggesting a growing perception of Europe as an attractive investment destination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting the potential for earning higher returns than the current inflation rate. It notes that while national average CD yields range from 1.70% to 2.00% for terms of one to five years, top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41%. The article advises looking at online banks for the most competitive rates and considering short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve. The piece suggests strategies for locking in the best CD rate, including laddering CDs to take advantage of high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, "And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America," argues that housing should be recognized as a human right to address the homelessness crisis effectively. The book examines the origins of the crisis, the systemic failures perpetuating it, and potential solutions like the "Housing First" model. Foscarinis contends that homelessness is a policy failure, not a personal one, and criticizes bipartisan policies that have contributed to the problem. The book advocates for enshrining the right to housing in law to enable effective interventions and asserts that the biggest barrier to ending homelessness is a lack of political will.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is driven by a fear of failure, which serves as a major motivator for his success, according to his biographer Stephen Witt. Huang's anxiety about the company's potential implosion pushes him to work harder and achieve more. Witt notes that Huang's motivation stems from negative emotions such as fear, paranoia, and guilt. Other CEOs are typically more upbeat, but Huang's constant self-criticism and discomfort with success contribute to his drive.</p>
