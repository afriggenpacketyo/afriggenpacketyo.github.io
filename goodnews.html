          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens of the UAE Team Emirates-XRG achieved his first career Tour de France stage victory with a successful breakaway in the 15th stage. Typically serving as a support rider for race leader Tadej Pogacar, Wellens was given the freedom to attack on the final climb and finished one minute and 28 seconds ahead of the next rider. This marks the fifth stage win for his team in this year's Tour. Pogacar maintained his significant overall lead in the general classification, expressing great happiness for his teammate's personal victory as the race heads into its final week.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030. This announcement follows the release of data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024, reaching a record high. The pledge marks the first time the government has set a specific target on spill numbers amid public anger over the state of the nation's waterways and executive bonuses at polluting firms. Reed stated that the industry regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing" and that regulation must change, though he ruled out nationalizing the water companies due to the high cost.</p>

          <p>Anna Rutherford, a 43-year-old lawyer and mother-of-three from Scotland, won the inaugural 100-mile Rat Race ultra-marathon in a remarkable time of 17 hours and 23 minutes. She finished more than two hours ahead of the closest male runner and five hours ahead of the next woman. During the race from Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh, she ran the final 50 miles alone and even briefly stopped to check on a man lying on a golf course. Rutherford credited her mental fortitude, inspired by other runners, and a diet of stock powder and pretzels for her incredible performance.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week in the stock market will be heavily influenced by the second-quarter earnings season, with key reports expected from industrial and healthcare giants like Danaher, GE Vernova, and Honeywell, as well as financial firm Capital One. Investors will be watching Danaher's performance in China and any updates on Capital One's acquisition of Discover. High expectations are set for GE Vernova, driven by AI data center demand, while Honeywell is projected to deliver a beat-and-raise quarter. The analysis suggests a potentially positive setup for Dover, which may revise its outlook upward given the improved trade truce with China (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for 'Neutral Ground' in a Divided America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:29:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that in an era of deep political division, finding "common ground" is less feasible than seeking "neutral ground." Recounting his experience surfing with his politically different brother-in-law, Litt argues that shared activities can build friendships and foster genuine discussion, even when disagreements on major issues persist. He encourages people to connect over shared interests rather than focusing on differences, allowing for relationships to form outside the political sphere. This approach, he posits, is more important than ever for bridging the divides in American society.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the most crucial skill for a child's lifelong success is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their feelings, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are vital for mental health and well-being.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. The meeting could occur on the sidelines of the summit, or potentially during a visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows a recent face-to-face meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was seen as a key step in stabilizing relations. After a period of tension marked by tariff threats, both nations have recently worked to de-escalate, including agreeing to a preliminary trade deal.</p>

          <p>The small desert town of Newberry Springs, California, located on the historic Route 66, is banking on a tourism revival for the road's 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s, a fate shared by many similar communities. Local residents and business owners are now banding together to prepare for an anticipated flood of visitors, planning history tours, events, and new accommodations. They hope the centennial will breathe new life into their community, which they describe as a slice of Americana "frozen in time," while preserving its unique rural character.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid conflicting data on the U.S. jobs market, this analysis argues that traditional metrics like unemployment and job creation are becoming obsolete. The rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the gig economy, and remote work creating time for side hustles means that "jobs" are no longer a clear indicator of economic health. The article suggests a more relevant measure would be tracking the number of people earning above a certain income threshold from all sources, adjusted for inflation. This shift would provide a more accurate picture of the labor market's health in an economy being reshaped by AI and new work structures (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events and media company Create & Cultivate, states that the biggest red flag in a job interview is a candidate who is unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company. She values candidates who have done their research and can offer genuine, constructive feedback on the business's current operations, such as its marketing strategies. Conversely, she is most impressed by applicants who can openly discuss their past mistakes and what they learned from them. For a fast-moving startup environment, Johnson looks for adaptable problem-solvers who can demonstrate their due diligence before even entering the interview.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir and interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, recounts her trailblazing career and the challenges she faced, including racism and sexism.

Moseley Braun reflects on her historic 1992 election and the current political landscape, where she sees progress being reversed. Despite the setbacks, she remains optimistic that Americans ultimately value democracy.</p>
