          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Common Parental "Lies" That May Hinder a Child's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist with over 20 years of experience outlines six common but potentially harmful statements parents make to their children, such as "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything." The article argues that while well-intentioned, these phrases can create unrealistic expectations, invalidate a child's feelings, and discourage them from seeking help. Instead, the expert suggests fostering resilience by redefining success, acknowledging difficult emotions, and teaching the difference between harmful dishonesty and acceptable white lies. The advice aims to help parents raise emotionally healthy and successful children by replacing these common fibs with more balanced messages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing announced a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, reporting a loss of $176 million compared to $1.09 billion a year prior, as revenue climbed 35% to $22.75 billion. The improvements are attributed to the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018, signaling a potential recovery for the embattled manufacturer. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," although the company still faces challenges, including production limits and delayed certifications for its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models. The positive results come despite a $445 million charge related to a Justice Department settlement over two fatal 737 Max crashes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karl Schlögel, a German historian specializing in Eastern Europe, has been awarded the 2025 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade for his insightful work on Russia and Ukraine. The prize jury highlighted Schlögel as one of the first to warn against Vladimir Putin's expansionist policies and for his continued advocacy for Ukraine's place in Europe. His research, which refocused on Ukraine following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, is praised for correcting prejudices and making history vivid and accessible. Schlögel stated the award is a great honor and emphasized that Germany must prepare to defend Ukraine, asserting that "Russia is the enemy."</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca's CEO, Pascal Soriot, has emphasized the company's strong commitment to the U.S. market following reports that the U.K.-listed firm might shift its listing to the United States. Soriot highlighted plans to invest $50 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research, aiming for the country to represent 50% of the company's revenue by 2030. This announcement came as AstraZeneca reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, driven by strong sales of its cancer and biopharmaceutical products. The company is strategically increasing its U.S. presence, partly in response to President Trump's calls to reshore manufacturing and potential transatlantic trade tariffs.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 09:54:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three successful strategies for maintaining productivity. The first involves implementing "productivity hacks," primarily by reducing the number and length of meetings and protecting focused work time. The second strategy is process engineering, where employees are empowered to make their tasks more efficient, a method particularly effective in manufacturing settings. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects, allowing them to reallocate time to more strategic goals. These changes have led to higher profits and lower employee turnover.</p>

          <p>A Welsh zoo is celebrating the birth of four rare Sumatran tiger cubs, the largest litter ever born in the United Kingdom. The arrival of the cubs at Manor House Wildlife Park in Pembrokeshire offers new hope for the critically endangered species, of which fewer than 400 remain in the wild. The births are part of a strictly managed European breeding program designed to ensure genetic diversity and the long-term survival of the species. The park's owner, Anna Ryder Richardson, described the event as a "once in a lifetime opportunity" and highlighted the crucial role zoos play in conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>During a visit to his Scottish golf resort, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney to discuss several key issues, including U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky and the conflict in Gaza. Swinney advocated for an exemption for Scotch whisky from the 10% tariff, highlighting its unique status as a product that can only be made in Scotland. The first minister also urged the president to use his influence to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting, which took place at Trump's Balmedie estate, also touched upon North Sea oil and gas taxation, with both leaders expressing concerns that the industry is being overtaxed.</p>

His work, which includes analyzing the drug supply to provide real-time information to users, has become a vital resource in understanding the overdose crisis. Dasgupta expressed immense relief over recent data showing a 27% drop in overdose deaths from 2023 to 2024, the first significant decline in years. He attributes the drop to a less deadly drug supply and better access to treatment and naloxone, feeling for the first time that efforts are headed in the right direction.</p>
