          <p>In an interview, Rutger Bregman, author of 'Moral Ambition,' discusses the importance of finding meaning in one's career by contributing to solving the world's pressing issues. Bregman critiques the conventional advice of 'following your passion,' suggesting instead that individuals should identify significant problems and determine how they can make a difference. He emphasizes that personal passion can develop from contributing to important causes and that there is a need for more moral ambition in today's world. The author encourages individuals to join or start groups dedicated to changing the world, even if it means being perceived as unconventional, drawing parallels to historical movements like abolitionism and suffragism. </p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The legislation requires two doctors to assess the patient's mental fitness and confirm their terminal illness. The vote follows similar proposals in England and Wales, with supporters arguing it's a progressive move to alleviate suffering, while opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The outcome is expected to be close, with First Minister John Swinney among those opposed to the bill. </p>

          <p>Proposed 'baby bonuses' from the Trump administration to incentivize childbirth have been met with criticism, as many women express concerns about the high cost of raising children in the U.S. Social media users have voiced indignation over the inadequacy of the proposed policies, citing unaffordable childcare, housing, and food costs. Critics argue that the administration's focus on incentivizing childbirth does not address the broader issues of supporting families and ensuring affordable access to essential resources. Some also express concerns that the pronatalist movement is intertwined with racism and ableism. </p>

          <p>Fueled by economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability, gold is experiencing a resurgence in popularity as investors seek safe-haven assets. The price of gold has increased significantly since Donald Trump's election, with central banks also contributing to the demand by diversifying their assets. Consumers are purchasing more gold bars and coins, while jewelry sales have decreased. Despite a recent price dip, analysts predict further increases, citing ongoing trade tensions and central bank buying. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% in a temporary trade deal, with China reciprocating by lowering tariffs on U.S. goods. This move comes after warnings of price hikes and shortages due to the high tariffs, which were effectively an embargo. Despite Trump's claims that China needs the U.S. more, the decision indicates America's reliance on trade with other countries. The temporary deal aims to alleviate economic pressure, though tariffs remain higher than before Trump's second term. </p>
