        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey reveals that family offices, the investment firms for ultra-wealthy families, are shifting their portfolio allocations towards public stocks and away from private equity. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity investments dropped to 21%, marking a significant change from 2023. Despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation, these firms maintain a pro-risk stance, often investing opportunistically during market dislocations. The survey also highlights a growing interest in artificial intelligence, primarily through public equities and ETFs, and a continued, albeit more selective, engagement with private equity secondaries.

          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and HELOCs are presented as more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. With the average homeowner holding significant equity, these products offer substantially lower interest rates, which are expected to decrease further if the Federal Reserve implements rate cuts. The article outlines the current average rates for these loans and explains the fundamental differences between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate HELOC. It serves as a guide for homeowners considering tapping into their home equity for financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard mathematician Liu Jun has clarified that his decision to leave the United States for a position at Tsinghua University in China was driven by personal and family reasons, not political protest. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu explained his deep connection to the Tsinghua campus, where he was born, was a primary motivator. His move had previously sparked speculation about its potential links to the political climate under the Trump administration or professional disillusionment. Liu's statement aims to quell such rumors, emphasizing the personal nature of his choice to return to his roots.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely stemming from U.S. tariff policies. Despite euro zone inflation being near the bank's 2% target, concerns about sluggish economic growth and the potential impact of trade disputes have led to a cautious approach. ECB President Christine Lagarde indicated a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting strategy without pre-committing to a future rate path. The bank slightly revised its 2025 growth forecast upward but acknowledged that lingering tariff issues could still weigh on demand later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles III, at Buckingham Palace during a rare trip to the United Kingdom, marking their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024. The private meeting for tea comes amid the King's ongoing cancer treatment and Harry's stated desire to rebuild strained family relationships.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark decision for gender equality, South Africa's highest court has ruled that a law preventing men from taking their wife's surname is unconstitutional. The Constitutional Court found that the existing legislation amounted to gender-based discrimination, upholding a challenge brought by two couples who were denied this right. The ruling overturns an archaic and patriarchal law, affirming the equality rights enshrined in the country's post-apartheid constitution. Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's decision, allowing husbands the same choice that wives have regarding their surname.</p>
