          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi outlines three limiting money beliefs that prevent people from increasing their income. These include the false notion that one should already know how to manage money, the expectation that success should come easily if one is talented, and the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start later. Sethi argues that earning more is a skill that requires learning, patience, and immediate, consistent action rather than waiting for a perfect moment. Overcoming these mental blocks is the first crucial step toward achieving financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative, identifying Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as the most promising initial sites for development. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's strategy of creating new towns to address housing shortages. However, the proposal faces challenges, including industry warnings about rising costs and criticism from some local communities who feel uninformed about the project's scale.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular trend on TikTok suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the bottoms of one's feet at bedtime can significantly improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels. However, health experts interviewed for the article express skepticism, noting there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims, especially regarding topical absorption through the thick skin of the feet. They suggest that any perceived benefits might be due to the placebo effect or the relaxing nature of a nightly foot massage routine. Experts recommend focusing on evidence-based sleep hygiene practices rather than unproven social media hacks.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos in the U.S. are installing personal air quality sensors to gather local data on pollution in their neighborhoods, which are disproportionately affected by toxic air. This grassroots effort, supported by organizations like the Hispanic Access Foundation, aims to fill data gaps left by official government monitoring, which often overlooks communities of color. By tracking pollutants like PM2.5 from nearby industrial sites and traffic, residents hope to use the data to advocate for stronger environmental regulations and enforcement. The initiative empowers communities to take action against environmental injustice and protect their health.</p>

          <p>Following their victory over Canada in the Women's Rugby World Cup final at a packed Twickenham stadium, members of England's Red Roses squad expressed their desire to use the win as a catalyst for inspiration. Players emphasized that their goal was not just to win the tournament but also to create a lasting legacy that encourages young girls to take up the sport. Captain Zoe Aldcroft noted the influence of other successful women's sports teams, like the Lionesses, in motivating them.

          <p>China is actively promoting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Africa as a tool of health diplomacy and a way to expand its cultural influence and soft power on the continent. A new TCM facility recently opened at a university hospital in Tunisia, and a similar training center was established in Chad, reflecting Beijing's strategic use of medical cooperation to build goodwill. For decades, China has sent medical teams to Africa, and the establishment of these permanent TCM centers in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Morocco represents a deepening of this strategy to strengthen cultural and diplomatic ties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite occasional large fires, the United States has seen a dramatic decrease in the frequency and lethality of urban fires over the past 40 years. Since 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate has dropped by approximately two-thirds, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This progress is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements in safety standards. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinklers, safer furniture materials, a decline in smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety codes in modern buildings.</p>

          <p>Swiss citizens are voting in a second referendum on whether to introduce a national electronic identity card, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous objections by making the e-ID optional and keeping the system entirely state-run, with data stored on users' phones instead of a central database. Supporters argue the system will streamline many bureaucratic and commercial processes online. However, opponents remain wary of potential privacy erosion and data misuse, reflecting Switzerland's strong tradition of protecting individual privacy from state and corporate intrusion.</p>

          <p>Following the Pentagon's decision to take an equity stake and provide a price floor for rare earth miner MP Materials, industry leaders believe the U.S. government must strike more deals to secure the nation's supply chain against Chinese dominance. The move signals a shift towards strategic capitalism to counter China's market manipulation of critical minerals like rare earths and lithium, which are vital for defense and technology. Other mining companies, including Energy Fuels and Lithium Americas, have seen their stocks surge on speculation that they could be the next targets for similar federal investment and support.

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, discovered by a Fort Myers resident during the cleanup after Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been preserved by Florida state archeologists. The 9-foot log boat is unique among the 450 ancient canoes found in the state because it is made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating is ongoing, the discovery adds another fascinating piece to Florida's rich history as a global leader in ancient watercraft finds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's recent dominance in women's rugby, culminating in their World Cup victory, is the result of strategic decisions made nearly a decade ago. The establishment of a new, professionally supported domestic league in 2016 and the introduction of full-time central contracts for players in 2018 were pivotal. These investments, initially met with financial concerns, dramatically raised the standard of play and created significant depth in the national squad. This long-term planning and financial commitment, partly driven by sponsor interest in the women's game, transformed the Red Roses from a major force into the undisputed world leader.</p>
