          <p>President Trump has pardoned reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been serving prison sentences for bank and tax fraud since 2022. The couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of millions and concealing income from their reality TV show to avoid paying taxes. The Chrisleys had sought a presidential pardon, alleging misconduct by the government and false testimony from a key witness. Their lawyer claimed they were targeted due to their conservative views and high profile, and their daughter had publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions.</p>

          <p>With negotiations to end the war in Ukraine faltering, the Trump administration is shifting its focus to the Middle East, seeking progress toward landmark deals. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that a temporary truce in Gaza is within reach, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. The administration also believes it is close to brokering a nuclear agreement with Iran, although key gaps remain. Trump has indicated that he will give Russia more time before determining if President Putin genuinely wants peace in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the largest police union in the country, has announced its support for key provisions of President Trump's "big, beautiful" budget bill. FOP President Patrick Yoes praised the bill's tax deduction for overtime pay and increase in state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which he said are important to the organization's members. The bill, which passed the House, faces opposition in the Senate, with concerns raised about its impact on the national deficit and its benefits primarily accruing to high-cost-of-living areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed reservations about a Boeing 747-8 gifted by Qatar, stating that the aircraft is too large to be his personal plane. While the plane was intended as a replacement for Air Force One, Trump indicated it would instead be refitted for military standard and used by the United States Air Force. The original offer from Qatar drew criticism, with some calling it "the definition of corruption." Trump's comments suggest a shift in the plane's intended use, from a personal perk to a national asset.</p>

          <p>President Trump is using his clemency powers to reward allies and supporters who echo his claims of political prosecutions, undermining Justice Department cases against them. Trump announced a series of pardons and commutations, including for individuals with ties to him or conservative groups. Many pardon seekers are demonstrating their loyalty to Trump and accusing the Biden Justice Department of targeting them. This approach has created a cottage industry of clemency lobbyists and lawyers offering to help shape such appeals.</p>

          <p>The government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, seeking to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, could make it easier for millions of homes in England to install heat pumps. Consumer groups caution that the changes may not help renters or leaseholders, and the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier. Older housing stock may also require upgrades to pipework and insulation, adding to the expense.</p>

          <p>Seven Colombian nationals have been arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, in connection to a string of "burglary tourism" home break-ins in Burbank and other Southern California cities. The suspects are believed to be part of a trend involving South American groups entering the U.S. on tourist visas and targeting wealthy residences, stealing jewelry and other high-value items. One of the suspects allegedly used a stolen French bulldog as part of the group's cover, walking it to blend in with the neighborhood while acting as a lookout. The suspects are being held on a $150,000 cash-only bond.</p>
