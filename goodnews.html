          <p>China has rapidly advanced in civil engineering, becoming a global leader in constructing mega-bridges that defy geographical challenges. A study highlights that by 2030, China will hold records for the longest suspension spans and tallest crossings. Projects like the Huajiang Canyon Bridge and the Zhangjinggao Yangtze River Bridge showcase innovative techniques, precision survey methods, and advanced modeling. The incorporation of artificial intelligence and automated equipment is expected to further enhance safety and efficiency in bridge construction.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 23:53:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles, aiming to decrease soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action follows newly appointed farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi's pledge to address rising rice prices, which have strained household budgets amid broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. Koizumi emphasized the urgency to alleviate public concerns, as supermarket rice prices reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, roughly double the previous year's level.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. Trump told reporters that the deal involves investment and partial ownership, but control will be maintained by the United States. This announcement followed Trump's earlier social media post highlighting the partnership, which he claimed would create 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the U.S. economy. Trump's approval came after a federal agency review of Nippon Steel's acquisition plan, with details of the potential scheme remaining undisclosed.</p>
