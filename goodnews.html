          <p>The New York Knicks defeated the defending NBA champions, the Boston Celtics, with a decisive 119-81 victory, securing their place in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby led the Knicks with 23 points each, completing a 4-2 series win. The Knicks dominated the game, especially in the second quarter, with a celebrity-filled Madison Square Garden crowd cheering them on. The Celtics, already weakened by Jayson Tatum's Achilles tendon rupture, could not withstand the Knicks' offensive power, setting the stage for a highly anticipated showdown against the Indiana Pacers.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas, revealing their origins in modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. By sequencing genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, researchers found that early settlers split into isolated groups, such as Amazonian, Andean, and Patagonian communities, adapting to diverse environments. The study corroborates archaeological evidence and identifies the closest living relatives of Indigenous North Americans as West Beringian groups. This research also highlights genetic traits that affect the health of modern South Americans, offering insights into their vulnerability to infectious diseases and the importance of tailored healthcare.</p>

          <p>Tempers flared at the US PGA Championship as Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry exhibited their frustration on the course. Lowry, angered by a ruling on an embedded ball, slammed his club into the turf and swore loudly, ultimately missing the cut. Hatton, after a poor tee shot, was heard swearing at his driver. Both golfers are likely to face fines for their conduct, highlighting the intense pressure and emotions involved in high-stakes golf tournaments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a complex and shifting set of tariffs on various countries and industries deemed threats to US interests. While many of the initial tariffs have been paused or reduced, some remain active, including a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts, 30% on Chinese imports, and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by the USMCA. Exemptions have been granted for goods covered under the USMCA and certain electronics from China. The future of these trade policies remains uncertain as Trump continues to threaten additional tariffs.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a flexible approach to courting Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies, as evidenced by the attendance of representatives from Haiti and St Lucia at a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan, these Caribbean nations participated in the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States Forum, signaling a pragmatic shift towards engaging with Beijing. Analysts suggest this participation does not necessarily indicate a change in allegiance but reflects a broader trend of countries pursuing more pragmatic diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership under a wartime law, citing concerns about due process. The ruling suggests skepticism among the justices regarding the migrants' protections and sends the case back to a lower court for further examination. This decision comes amid other news, including a transit strike in New Jersey, peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and ongoing humanitarian concerns in Gaza.

High winds blowing over dry farmlands carried dust into the air, creating a dramatic scene reminiscent of "something out of the history books."

However, some of the UAE's political choices in Africa have raised concerns, particularly regarding its involvement in conflicts and support for controversial groups.</p>
