          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, a notable increase from 2022. This rise is attributed to both increased submissions and Tripadvisor's more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews, where businesses offer rewards for positive feedback. The company employs a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to combat fake reviews. Tripadvisor identifies four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, with most paid reviews originating from Asia. The company acknowledges the ongoing challenge of detecting fake reviews but emphasizes its commitment to improving its systems and penalizing violators.</p>

          <p>President Trump agreed to extend the deadline for negotiating tariffs with the European Union until July 9, following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump initially threatened to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods starting June 1, citing frustration with the pace of negotiations. Von der Leyen stated that the EU is ready to move "swiftly" to agree a trade deal with the U.S. but needs until July 9 to reach a "good deal." The decision comes after criticism from European leaders, who warned that tariffs would harm both economies, and the EU threatened to introduce its own measures against the U.S.</p>

          <p>Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique is experiencing a resurgence in wildlife populations after decades of war and poaching decimated its animal inhabitants. American entrepreneur Greg Carr has dedicated years to revitalizing the park, reintroducing animals and investing in the local communities. Carr's vision extends beyond wildlife conservation to include human development, with initiatives focused on education, employment, and economic empowerment for the people living around the park. These efforts have led to increased ecotourism, carbon credit sales, and a self-sustaining model for the park that benefits both its animal and human residents.</p>

After an Italian expert recognized the mosaic, it was seized by prosecutors and returned to the Nemi Museum in Italy.

It took archeologists nine years to carefully recover more than a million pieces of the past, while an underground parking garage and modern building was built around them.

The sport is exciting and dangerous, and injuries to both horses and humans are common. Ken Real Bird says the roots of modern Indian Relay are in the horse-stealing raids that tribes once staged against White settlers and each other. Mason Red Wing feels a close connection to his horses, and he said that when he was younger, he didn't want to be Native American, but the horse helped him reconnect with his culture and be proud of who he is and proud of where he's from.</p>

          <p>Emotionally safe parenting is a new parenting framework rooted in what kids need most but rarely receive: emotional safety. With emotionally safe parenting, the goal is to be deeply attuned to your child's emotional needs. Emotionally safe parenting sets clear boundaries and encourages independence, and encourages parents to focus on emotional attunement, self-awareness and inner healing. Emotionally safe parenting isn't about being perfect, it's about modeling what healthy repair looks like, and communication is everything.</p>

          <p>Mumford & Sons closed this year's Radio 1's Big Weekend with a thrilling set full of new and old songs. The headline act played hits such as I Will Wait and Rushmere to entertain the crowd at Sefton Park in Liverpool, complete with fireworks and confetti. Over the three days, an estimated 100,000 music fans enjoyed around 100 performances across four stages. The day saw mixed weather at the festival site, with Tate McRae's early high-energy performance basking in the sunshine contrasted with fans braving a heavy downpour to watch Haim later on.</p>
