          <p>China is accelerating its efforts to construct the world's first nuclear fusion reactor capable of achieving net energy generation, named the Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best), located in Hefei, and is expected to be completed in 2027. The project involves assembling tens of thousands of components and is being led by Neo Fusion, a state-backed company. According to project engineer Song Yuntao, China has mastered the core technologies, and chairman Yan Jianwen noted the project's rapid progress, referring to it as 'China speed.' This initiative aims to commercialize a clean, safe, and near-limitless energy source.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The area in South Texas where Elon Musk's SpaceX operates has officially been incorporated as the city of Starbase, with residents, mostly SpaceX employees, voting overwhelmingly in favor. The new city will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners, holding power over planning and taxation, with SpaceX vice-president Bobby Peden set to be the first mayor. While some nearby residents have voiced opposition due to environmental concerns, Starbase's incorporation could lead to disputes with Cameron County over beach access during rocket launches. This development follows Musk's relocation of many of his business operations to Texas, citing favorable regulations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-person adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray,' which explores themes of narcissism and image obsession in the age of social media. The production uses elaborate camerawork and smartphone technology to portray Dorian's descent into hedonism and his fascination with the gap between his false perfection and true self. The play contrasts with another London import, 'Vanya,' offering different perspectives on self-expression and the performance of identity in a culture dominated by social media. The article examines how the play scrutinizes the superficiality embraced by Dorian and his peers and how it ultimately destroys the tender parts of a person.</p>
