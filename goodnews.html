          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a significant increase in sponsorships and stadium attendance, driven by the rising popularity of soccer in the United States. This growth is attributed to the sport's increasing cultural relevance, the approaching 2026 World Cup, and the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival in MLS. Brands are investing heavily in MLS, drawn by the league's younger, more diverse fanbase and the high engagement rates associated with live sports. Commissioner Don Garber reported over 12 million fans attended games in 2024, highlighting the league's expanding reach and influence within the U.S. sports landscape.</p>

          <p>Richard Irvine, founder of the Colonsay Smokery on the Scottish island of Colonsay, is looking to give away his business for free to a family willing to relocate and contribute to the island's community. Irvine hopes this initiative will attract younger residents to address the island's aging population and boost the local school's enrollment. The ideal candidate would possess entrepreneurial spirit and an interest in food, with the potential to expand the business and its online presence. Irvine aims to give back to the island he loves by providing an opportunity for a young couple or family to thrive.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Official Global Soccer Team Valuations 2025 reports that the world's 25 most valuable soccer teams are worth an average of $2.76 billion, with Real Madrid leading the list at $6.7 billion. The Premier League's lucrative broadcasting deals contribute to the high valuations of English teams, with its domestic and international rights worth approximately $4.4 billion annually. Improved stadium economics are expected to boost revenue for teams like Barcelona and Inter Miami. These valuations are far behind those of the NFL and NBA, but ahead of MLB and the NHL.</p>
