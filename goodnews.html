          <p>Perplexity AI is reportedly in advanced discussions to secure $500 million in funding, potentially valuing the company at $14 billion. The funding round is expected to be led by Accel, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto. This potential funding comes after earlier reports indicated Perplexity's ambitions to raise between $500 million and $1 billion, with a valuation target of $18 billion. Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine, competes with major players like Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, and the new funds could bolster its competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials and state-run media are portraying the initial trade agreement and 90-day tariff pause with the United States as a significant win for Beijing. They assert that China's firm stance and countermeasures were instrumental in securing the deal with U.S. officials in Switzerland, with relatively few concessions. The article reports that Chinese negotiators appear to have convinced the Trump administration to roll back most of the 145% tariff rate imposed by Trump, reducing them to 30%. In return, China pledged to roll back most of its counter-tariffs against the United States.</p>
