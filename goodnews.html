          <p>U.S. stock markets, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, surged to new record highs, driven by investor optimism about potential trade deals with China and India. This rally marks a significant turnaround from a recent bear market, fueled by calmer White House rhetoric on tariffs and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Despite the positive momentum, some analysts express caution, suggesting that market complacency regarding trade and tariff issues could pose future risks. The market also digested new data showing a slight increase in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal in Washington, aiming to end decades of conflict fueled by armed rebel groups in eastern DR Congo. The agreement calls for the disarmament of militias like M23, which Rwanda is accused of backing, and the FDLR, which DR Congo is accused of supporting. However, the deal lacks specific details on the withdrawal of thousands of Rwandan troops from Congolese territory, a major point of contention. While hailed as a diplomatic success, the ambiguity of the terms leaves critical questions unanswered, casting doubt on its long-term effectiveness compared to previous failed peace efforts.</p>

Representing parts of Queens as a state assemblyman, Mamdani ran a grassroots campaign focused on high visibility and direct engagement with voters, reminiscent of former mayor Ed Koch's famous "How'm I doin'?" approach. His victory represents a significant win for the progressive wing of the Democratic party in one of the nation's most prominent political arenas. The article suggests that while his progressive stance is framed as a challenge to Donald Trump, it may also present opportunities for the former president.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are exploring relief options like debt settlement, where creditors agree to accept less than the full amount owed. This article explains that while there's no official cap, settlement becomes less effective for debts exceeding $100,000, as creditors are more likely to pursue lawsuits for larger sums. The process requires saving a significant lump sum for settlement offers, and fees for professional services can be substantial. For those with overwhelming debt, alternatives like debt consolidation loans, credit counseling, or, in extreme cases, bankruptcy might be more practical solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. consumers are increasingly shifting their financial habits from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to a more cautious "revenge saving" approach. Driven by concerns over tariffs, inflation, and market volatility, the personal saving rate has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May. Financial experts note that consumers are paring back discretionary spending and prioritizing the creation of emergency funds to shield themselves from future economic shocks. This trend is also reflected in retirement savings, with 401(k) contribution rates hitting record highs as workers focus on long-term financial stability.</p>

Kuniskis acknowledged that past issues with pricing and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500 contributed to the brand's slump.
