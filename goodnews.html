          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a wave of spicy new menu items in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are leveraging bold, hot flavors as a low-cost, high-return strategy to boost sales amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily fueled by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests generate significant buzz. While effective, restaurants face the challenge of rapidly shifting youth trends, requiring constant innovation to maintain engagement.</p>

          <p>After a seemingly routine foot surgery, Amber Meade developed excruciating, debilitating pain that was eventually diagnosed as chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. For months, she faced misdiagnoses and immense difficulty with daily life, as even the lightest touch could trigger severe pain. She eventually found a specialized physical therapist and a multi-pronged treatment plan, including ketamine infusions, which have helped manage her symptoms. While not a cure, the treatment has allowed her to regain some functionality and improve her quality of life.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has partially limited the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The ruling upholds a lower court's decision that the government cannot ignore laws requiring it to hear claims for other humanitarian protections, such as "withholding of removal" and relief under the Convention Against Torture. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself, it affirmed that these other mandatory protections cannot be suspended by presidential proclamation. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by the ACLU challenging the policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how federal agents can conduct "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. This ruling stems from a lawsuit over raids in June where U.S. citizens were among those detained. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the decision for protecting constitutional rights against unreasonable seizures and racial profiling in their communities.</p>

The new terminal will feature light-filled spaces, 23 wide-body capable gates, and a resilient microgrid for independent power.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, named Endeavour, successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new four-person crew after a 16-hour journey. The international team includes two NASA astronauts, Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, alongside Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. Their arrival brings the station's total crew to eleven, allowing the previous Crew-10 members to prepare for their return to Earth next week. The mission, known as Crew-11, may be extended from the typical six months to eight, as NASA considers longer stays aboard the ISS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a position in Equinix, a global data center operator, following a significant drop in the company's stock price. The share price fell after Equinix announced higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast, which concerned short-term investors. Elliott, known for its expertise in the data center sector, likely sees long-term value in the company's expansion to meet growing demand from AI and hyperscalers. The firm may push Equinix to improve its market communications, optimize costs, and enhance shareholder returns through its operational and financial experience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 07:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As airlines, including now Southwest, move toward more complex boarding systems with assigned seating, travel experts say the primary reason to purchase an early boarding upgrade is to secure space for a carry-on bag in the overhead bins. With overhead space at a premium, passengers in later boarding groups risk having to check their bags at the gate. Travelers can gain priority boarding by paying for an add-on, holding elite status with the airline, or using a co-branded credit card. Booking premium economy fares also typically grants an earlier boarding position, though at a significantly higher cost.</p>

          <p>Following his treatment for bladder cancer, University of Colorado coach Deion Sanders received a neobladder, a new bladder constructed from a segment of his own small intestine. Surgeons explain that the procedure involves removing the cancerous bladder and reshaping a piece of the patient's intestine into a new reservoir, which is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because it uses the patient's own tissue, the body does not reject it. Sanders has been open about the recovery process, including challenges with incontinence, which medical experts say helps destigmatize the condition for many other patients.</p>

However, the path home is complex, with challenges including destroyed homes, a lack of job prospects, and the psychological trauma of war. Aid organizations are working to prepare for a large-scale return, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive government strategy for housing, employment, and social cohesion. For many, like Iryna Schestova who returned to Kyiv, the desire to be in their home country outweighs the difficulties of living abroad.</p>

The odds of a non-related couple being a compatible match are approximately one in 100,000. Jim's kidney function had dropped dramatically after complications from a procedure, and the couple was facing a potentially long and difficult wait on the national transplant list. Mirna's willingness to donate and the subsequent discovery that she was a near-perfect genetic match has given them a new sense of hope for their future together.</p>

          <p>An opinion column pushes back against the notion that the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship, won in the Orlando "Bubble," is somehow less legitimate. The author refutes comments from 76ers executive Daryl Morey, arguing that discounting the title ignores the immense courage and mental fortitude required to compete during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece emphasizes the challenges of isolation, daily testing, and the fear surrounding the virus at the time. It concludes that winning under such historic and difficult circumstances should be honored with an exclamation point, not an asterisk.</p>

          <p>The American-made animated film 'K-pop Demon Hunters' has become a massive hit in South Korea, celebrated for its detailed and authentic portrayal of Korean culture, folklore, and contemporary life. The movie follows a fictional K-pop girl group that fights evil, and its popularity is rooted in its keen observations, from dining etiquette to its use of traditional art motifs. Despite being an American production, its success in Korea highlights the increasingly fluid and global nature of the "K-wave." South Korean audiences have praised the film for capturing local idiosyncrasies with a level of accuracy rarely seen in outside depictions.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to unionize, joining a growing movement of coffee shop organizing across the United States. The workers at three Oakland locations and one in Berkeley voted 22-to-5 to join the Blue Bottle Independent Union. Key motivations for the union drive include seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the restoration of perks lost since Nestlé acquired the company. This victory follows a successful unionization effort by the same independent union at six Boston-area stores last year.</p>
