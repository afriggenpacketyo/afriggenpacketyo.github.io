          <p>Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from Jewish environmental activists who argue his policies weaken environmental protections, conflicting with the Jewish value of repairing the world (tikkun olam). Zeldin defended his policies as based on law and science, separate from religious interpretations, while others argued that smart regulations can align with Jewish values of protecting both the environment and the economy. The ceremony included the inscription of Hebrew passages related to the environment into a new Torah, highlighting the diverse interpretations of Judaism's stance on environmental stewardship. The article emphasizes the tension between religious observance and environmental responsibility in the context of political action.</p>
