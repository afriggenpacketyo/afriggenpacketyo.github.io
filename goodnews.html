          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, advocating for enhanced artificial intelligence cooperation among member states and cautioning against a "Cold War mentality" in international relations. Speaking to over 20 foreign leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, Xi emphasized China's commitment to fostering high-quality development and cooperation within the bloc. He highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education, positioning China as a global peacemaker amidst persistent trade tensions with the United States and other global conflicts. The summit aims to strengthen regional ties and economic collaboration, potentially increasing Beijing's influence and fostering multipolarity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in August, reaching a five-month high according to a private survey, which notably surpassed economists' estimates. This improvement was primarily driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand despite tariffs, though domestic demand growth remained subdued. Rising raw material costs led businesses to increase sale prices, stabilizing them after months of decline. While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector continued to shrink, indicating that the recovery might be a temporary relief rather than a sustained rally, with its durability dependent on export stability and domestic demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, effectively blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling followed an emergency injunction request from immigrant advocacy groups, who argued that the children, many with pending asylum claims and expressing credible fears of abuse and persecution, were being prepared for immediate repatriation. While Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo and U.S. Justice Department lawyers contended the action was for family reunification, advocacy groups disputed the voluntariness in several cases. This 14-day order prevents officials from sending the children back to Guatemala, underscoring the contentious legal battles surrounding U.S. immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin, signaling a renewed effort to normalize relations between the two Asian giants, despite past border conflicts and a significant trade deficit. This outreach is largely influenced by the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on Indian imports, pushing Delhi to seek alternative partnerships. While immediate outcomes include resuming direct flights and simpler visas, substantial roadblocks like border disputes and trade imbalances remain. India's pursuit of "strategic autonomy" by engaging China could complicate its relationships with Western allies like the Quad, highlighting a complex geopolitical balancing act.</p>

          <h2>Report Suggests Australian Teen Social Media Ban Can Be Effective, Despite Implementation Challenges</h2>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government suggests that its upcoming social media ban for under-16s, slated for December, can be effective, though various implementation technologies present inherent risks and shortcomings. The policy, designed to curb harmful social media impacts, mandates platforms to take "reasonable steps" to prevent underage accounts and deactivate existing ones. While popular with many parents, experts raise concerns about data privacy and the accuracy of age verification technology, particularly within the "buffer zone" around age 16. The report recommends employing layered methods and notes that tech providers are actively addressing circumvention, with companies facing substantial fines for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping officially opened the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, attended by leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi. The SCO, founded in 2001 as a Eurasian security bloc, has expanded to 10 member states and now addresses a broader scope of trade and economic issues, increasingly positioning itself as an Asian counterweight to Western influence. At the summit, leaders are expected to sign a declaration to strengthen security, economic, and cultural cooperation, with Xi specifically advocating for the establishment of an SCO bank. This initiative underscores a broader strategic effort to deepen regional integration and foster greater economic independence among member nations.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic made history at the US Open, becoming the oldest man to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slams in a single season, despite an injury scare during his match. Early in his dominant fourth-round victory against qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff, Djokovic experienced neck discomfort, briefly affecting his play and leading to two dropped games. However, the 24-time Grand Slam champion quickly regained control, ultimately securing a commanding 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 win in 109 minutes. This victory, marking his 64th Grand Slam quarter-final, extends his all-time record and keeps alive his pursuit of an unprecedented 25th major title. He is now set to face the No. 4 seed, Taylor Fritz, the last American man in the bracket, for a place in the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged almost 19% following a better-than-expected net profit in its fiscal first quarter, largely fueled by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a revival in its e-commerce business. Despite missing revenue estimates, net income jumped 78%, though this included gains from equity investments and asset disposal. The company's cloud division saw 26% revenue growth, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth, positioning Alibaba as a major player in AI. While core e-commerce profits fell due to investments in "quick commerce," investors are rewarding Alibaba's AI and cloud growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Part of NASA's Artemis program, the 35kg rover, set for a 2029 launch, aims to find water and measure radiation levels on the Moon's south polar region, a crucial step for future manned missions and sustainable exploration. The mission will also demonstrate Canadian technology, building on its space history. Engineers face significant challenges, including extreme lunar temperatures and the abrasive regolith. Discovering water on the Moon could have immense implications, potentially transforming it into a "petrol station" for spacecraft.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion, offering 30 hours per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" for working families. However, parents face long waiting lists, and nurseries report staff shortages limiting availability, with the sector needing an estimated 35,000 more staff. The funding rates are often lower than costs, leading nurseries to increase "consumable fees," causing confusion and financial strain for parents. This highlights significant implementation challenges despite the policy's positive intent to support working families.</p>

          <p>A global craze, fueled by social media, has caused demand for matcha to skyrocket, transforming the green powder into a lucrative commodity but also leading to severe supply shortages and price hikes, even in Japan. Japanese green tea exports, particularly powdered matcha, have quadrupled in a decade. Producers face challenges in meeting this demand due to labor-intensive cultivation and an aging farming community. The Japanese government is considering subsidies to encourage more tencha cultivation, while retailers ration supplies and prices double. This "matcha mania" highlights the economic impact of cultural trends and the challenges of scaling traditional production.</p>
