        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, heightening concerns about an impending slowdown. Production output saw a decline, while services and construction showed slight increases. Economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of 2025, prompting Finance Minister Reeves to address economic revival as a top priority ahead of the Autumn Budget. The Bank of England is also weighing fiscal uncertainties against persistent inflation, with expectations of holding rates steady in the near term. (not investment advice) The flat economic performance in July may not be enough to alleviate the Bank of England's inflation concerns, thus policy decisions remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained in a US immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia have returned to their home country. The return follows concerns raised by the South Korean president and Hyundai's CEO about the raid's impact on investment and factory operations. The departure was delayed due to a request from the White House, reportedly to assess the workers' willingness to remain in the US, with South Korea negotiating visa options for its workers in the US. The incident has sparked protests and concerns about future investments in the US, potentially delaying the factory's opening.</p>

          <p>European stocks are poised to open higher following data indicating that the UK economy's growth stalled in July. Futures tied to the Stoxx 50, FTSE 100, DAX, and CAC 40 indexes all show gains, while the UK's flat economic growth adds to the Bank of England's considerations for its upcoming monetary policy update. The European Central Bank recently left its key interest rate unchanged. In corporate news, Sabadell's board has recommended shareholders reject BBVA's takeover bid, and Ryanair may cut ticket sales to Spain amid a tax policy dispute.</p>

The satellite internet provision market is heating up, with plans for roughly 70,000 LEO satellites to launch between 2025 and 2031.

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill that allows for high-density housing near public transit hubs, overriding local zoning laws. The bill permits taller buildings near transit corridors, affecting single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile radius. Supporters argue it is necessary to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it strips local authorities of control. The vote follows opposition from the Los Angeles City Council, but support surged after a labor group reversed their stance in exchange for amendments.</p>
