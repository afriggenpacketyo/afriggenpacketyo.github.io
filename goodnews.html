          <p>A Denver jury has awarded $19.7 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 police shooting in a crowded downtown neighborhood. The civil lawsuit stemmed from an incident where officers opened fire on a man who had drawn a handgun. One of the officers, Brandon Ramos, later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned after a grand jury found he failed to account for the large crowd behind his target. Attorneys for the victims stated that the significant award sends a clear message about police accountability and the critical responsibility to protect innocent citizens during law enforcement operations, affirming that bystanders cannot be disregarded.</p>

Podcaster Johnathan Walton, one of her victims who chronicled her schemes and helped locate her, stated that the sentence was insufficient for a woman he described as an "inveterate con woman." Smyth was convicted in Northern Ireland of swindling over $155,000 from mortgage clients between 2008 and 2010. Walton's podcast detailed her extensive history of scams, including impersonating Jennifer Aniston and convincing him she was a wealthy Irish heiress.</p>

          <p>Indian opening batter Pratika Rawal has become a key player for her country at the Women's World Cup, a journey deeply rooted in the support of her father, Pradeep Rawal. A former university-level cricketer himself, he began training his daughter at age three, determined to help her achieve the dream he could not. In a culture where women's cricket has historically lacked support, his unwavering belief was crucial to her development. Now 25, Rawal has emerged as one of India's most promising stars, boasting an impressive batting average and showcasing the talent her father recognized when she was just a child, fulfilling his ambition through her own remarkable success.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are preparing for a new round of trade talks in Malaysia next week, aiming to de-escalate their ongoing tariff conflict. The negotiations were announced after President Donald Trump acknowledged in an interview that the current high tariffs on Chinese goods are "not sustainable," even as he defended his decision to implement them. These discussions occur in a tense economic climate marked by retaliatory actions, including China's export controls on critical rare-earth minerals and potential new U.S. restrictions on software. The primary objective is to forge a new agreement before a temporary tariff truce is set to expire on November 10. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Blood Test Shows Promise in Early Detection of Over 50 Cancer Types</h2>

          <p>A study has revealed exciting results for the Galleri blood test, which can detect more than 50 different types of cancer by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. In a North American trial involving 25,000 adults, the test successfully identified cancer in 62% of positive results, with over half of these cases caught at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers detected were types that currently lack any routine screening programs, such as ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer. While researchers believe the test could fundamentally change cancer screening, the full results of a larger NHS trial are anticipated next year to confirm its life-saving potential.</p>

          <p>Chen Ning Yang, a towering figure in theoretical physics and a Nobel laureate, has passed away at the age of 103. In 1957, Yang and his colleague Lee Tsung-Dao were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work challenging the law of parity conservation, which led to significant discoveries about elementary particles. Born in China, Yang pursued his advanced studies in the United States, working under Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago. He had a prolific and influential career, holding prestigious positions at institutions like Princeton and Beijing's Tsinghua University, leaving a profound legacy across multiple fields of physics.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport discovered she had a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney after a seemingly minor accident during a weekend trip to Butlin's. Charlotte Morjaria went to the hospital believing she had broken a rib after being playfully picked up during a game, but a precautionary CT scan revealed the hidden mass. The incidental finding led to a diagnosis of a rare form of kidney cancer, which had gone undetected despite symptoms like fatigue and back pain that she had attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free and credits the drunken holiday mishap with saving her life.</p>

His comments provide an international perspective on Trump's diplomatic approach ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Putin.

This innovation addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where many GPUs allocated to serve thousands of different AI models are often underutilized because only a few popular models receive the majority of user requests.
