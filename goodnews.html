          <p>President Trump has indicated that Vice President JD Vance is the most probable heir apparent to lead the MAGA movement. During a press event, Trump stated that while it is early, Vance is doing a "great job" and would likely be the favored candidate for 2028. He also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio as another potential contender, suggesting they might team up. Both Vance and Rubio, once critics of Trump, have since become staunch allies, though they have remained publicly noncommittal about their future presidential ambitions.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to drop in after-hours trading. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, just below the 49 cents anticipated, though its revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed forecasts. The company's AI business revenue saw a year-over-year decline, partly due to U.S. export restrictions to China, which cost it an estimated $800 million in sales. Despite these challenges, AMD's data center and gaming segments showed strong growth, and the company provided a positive sales outlook for the current quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is making a significant push to reduce its dependency on China for rare earth elements by reviving the Mountain Pass mine in California. With substantial funding from the Department of Defense, the effort aims to re-establish a domestic supply chain for these critical minerals, which are essential for everything from electric vehicles to advanced military technology. The mine has a troubled history, including a shutdown in 2002 and a bankruptcy in 2015 after a previous revival attempt. The Trump administration has intensified these efforts, viewing domestic production as crucial for national and economic security in the face of China's market dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced a new proposal aimed at simplifying the process for businesses to use drones for commercial purposes like delivery and inspection. Under the proposed rules, companies would follow a standardized approval process rather than seeking individual waivers for operating drones beyond the pilot's line of sight. The new framework would require commercial drones to meet certain industry safety standards, including collision avoidance technology, and would prohibit flights over large crowds. The move is intended to foster innovation and help the U.S. catch up with other countries in the deployment of commercial drone technology.</p>

The program provides grants to help state and local governments protect critical infrastructure before disasters strike.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to launch a pilot program to test coverage of expensive weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans with obesity who currently cannot afford the treatments, which cost about $1,000 per month. The plan, which could start in 2026, would be a major victory for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, as limited insurance coverage is a primary barrier to wider adoption. This development follows a similar proposal by the Biden administration that was later dropped, highlighting the ongoing debate over the cost and benefits of covering these popular GLP-1 drugs.

          <h2>Report Identifies US Metro Areas Where Home Prices Are Declining</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 17:04:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. metropolitan areas, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their peak prices in 2022, with declines of nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is largely driven by an increase in housing inventory in these regions, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience tight inventory and rising prices, with cities like Milwaukee seeing a 26% increase since 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent comments by President Donald Trump have fueled speculation on who will be the next Federal Reserve chair, with prediction markets showing a surge for Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke highly of both men, referring to them as "the Kevins," while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention. Following the interview, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave both Hassett and Warsh, who are seen as proponents of lower interest rates, a 35% chance of being nominated. The resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler opens a seat on the board, allowing Trump to appoint a new member who could later be elevated to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings: A $10,000 3-Month CD vs. a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 16:15:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of placing $10,000 into a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. While a top high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher rate and thus marginally more interest over three months, its rate is variable and could fall. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed rate, providing guaranteed returns but sacrificing liquidity, as early withdrawals incur penalties. With interest rate cuts potentially on the horizon, the guaranteed rate of a CD may be more advantageous, but the choice ultimately depends on an individual saver's financial goals and need for flexibility.
