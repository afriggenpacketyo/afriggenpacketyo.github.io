          <p>Ahmed Ebid, an Egyptian-born man residing in the UK, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in smuggling nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023, some of whom later entered Britain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) believes Ebid is the first person convicted in the UK for organizing boat crossings across the Mediterranean. Ebid himself arrived in the UK via a small boat in 2022 after serving time in Italy for attempted drug smuggling and applied for asylum, though his claim was never resolved by the British government. This case highlights the ongoing efforts to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking across international borders.</p>

          <p>Reese Hogan, a California track athlete from Crean Lutheran High School, received praise on social media after briefly posing on the first-place podium following her loss to a transgender athlete in the triple jump at the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section Finals. Hogan set a personal and school record but was defeated by more than four feet. This incident occurred after Hogan and other athletes were allegedly asked to remove their "Protect Girls Sports" T-shirts at a previous meet, sparking controversy. The Trump administration has since put California and Governor Gavin Newsom on notice, as the CIF is under a Title IX investigation for its policies regarding transgender athletes.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor from Northampton, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred through a social media post on X. Connolly's tweet, made on the day of the Southport attacks, called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, garnering 310,000 views before deletion. Judges at the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, stating there was no arguable basis to deem it manifestly excessive. Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred at Birmingham Crown Court and will serve 40% of her sentence in prison before being released on license.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred at least 2.1 billion years ago. The study, published in Nature, suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes, cells or organisms with a membrane-bound nucleus, are the foundation of complex, multicellular life. Understanding the origin of eukaryotic cells can uncover insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Sonora, Mexico, an innovative program is helping to conserve jaguars by compensating ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, turning them from perceived threats to valuable features of the ecosystem. The Northern Jaguar Project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats, incentivizing them not to kill the animals. This initiative has expanded the protected area for jaguars, as participating ranchers agree not to harm any wild animals on their property, helping to maintain a stable or growing population of jaguars in the region. The program has also fostered a shift in attitudes among ranchers, who are increasingly recognizing the importance of preserving the local ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Ted McPhail, stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, strong supplier partnerships, and ongoing productivity improvements. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, aiming for no single country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would need to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot's Q1 earnings missed expectations, but sales beat estimates, and the company maintained its full-year sales forecast.</p>

The series features shorter, faster-paced games on a smaller pitch, designed to attract younger fans and generate more social media engagement.
