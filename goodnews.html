        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an environment marked by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, while locking in high rates for the CD's term. National average CD yields as of May 5, 2025, range from 2.02% APY for a 1-year CD to 1.70% APY for a 5-year CD, though top-performing CDs offer significantly higher rates. To maximize returns, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and explore short-term CDs, which currently have higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve. A practical approach is to ladder CDs, buying CDs with varying terms to balance short-term gains and long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>
