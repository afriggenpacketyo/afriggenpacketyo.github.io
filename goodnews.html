          <h2>Canadian Prime Minister Affirms Sovereignty Amidst Trump's Acquisition Proposal</h2>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's suggestion of Canada becoming the 51st state, stating that Canada is "not for sale ever." Trump responded with "never say never," indicating his continued interest in the idea despite Canada's stance. The exchange occurred amidst discussions on trade relations, which Trump described as unfairly subsidizing Canada. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two countries, but reiterated Canada's unwavering position on maintaining its sovereignty, with the talks occurring due to Carney's anti-Trump platform which propelled him to power.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, significantly jeopardizing Martin's confirmation. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants involved in the January 6th Capitol riot, a move seen as controversial given that the D.C. Attorney's Office prosecuted those cases. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination faces an uphill battle in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where a tie vote would prevent the nomination from advancing. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled for the second time that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport alleged gang members is unlawful, specifically in the case of two individuals suspected of affiliation with the Tren de Aragua gang. Judge Alvin Hellerstein granted a preliminary injunction, stating that the AEA was "not validly invoked" and that the individuals were not given adequate due process. This ruling follows a similar decision in Texas, where a judge permanently blocked the administration from using the AEA for deportations, highlighting ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he considers to be one of the most important of his career, highlighting the critical role of the oceans in supporting the planet and combating climate change. The film documents the catastrophic decline in ocean life during Sir David's lifetime, showing how industrial fishing practices like bottom trawling are devastating marine ecosystems. However, the film also offers a message of hope, emphasizing the ocean's capacity to recover rapidly if given the chance, citing the resurgence of whale populations as an example of successful conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz stated that the company does not anticipate a return of toy manufacturing to America, despite President Trump's tariffs aimed at encouraging domestic production. Kreiz explained that while toy creation, design, and engineering remain in America, manufacturing in other countries allows Mattel to produce quality products at affordable prices. The company has been diversifying its global manufacturing to reduce dependence on China, with plans to source less than 40% of its product from the country by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed on a trade deal after three years of talks, which aims to boost trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export products like whisky and cars to India, while cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. UK consumers are expected to benefit from lower tariffs on goods coming from India, and some Indian and British workers will gain from a three-year National Insurance exemption. The British government has described the deal as the "biggest and most economically significant" bilateral trade agreement the UK has signed since leaving the European Union in 2020.</p>

          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney has pledged to deliver an extra 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries over the next year in a bid to end the 08:00 "lottery" for booking appointments. Swinney also announced that his government would permanently ban peak rail fares and end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains. The BMA union, which represents Scotland's doctors, said it did not believe the extra 100,000 appointments promised in GP surgeries would end the 8am rush to book an appointment. Swinney's statement, coming just nine months after the last programme for government, was light on proposed legislation, with the First Minister instead emphasising his government's record in government.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have been steadily declining in cost throughout the year, with rates currently averaging around 7.95%, a significant drop from their peak in September 2024. While predicting future interest rate movements is risky, economists believe that HELOC rates are unlikely to change drastically this week, as the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current federal funds rate. However, comments made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the Fed's meeting could influence HELOC rates, with optimistic statements about future rate cuts potentially causing a further decline.</p>
