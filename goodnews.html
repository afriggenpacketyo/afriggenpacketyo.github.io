          <p>Federal officials discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by President Trump during Florida visits. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the find, while the Secret Service stated it located "items of interest" during pre-arrival sweeps. Investigations revealed the stand, which appeared to be a hunting platform, had been there for months and was only discovered once the Secret Service resumed using that specific airport section after construction. Authorities confirmed no impact on Trump's movements and no individuals were present at the location.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring three significant factors influencing the stock market this week: escalating US-China tensions, concerns about credit quality, and the ongoing federal government shutdown, all posing risks to the broader economy. Earnings season is gaining momentum, with major companies like Danaher, Capital One, GE Vernova, Honeywell, and Dover scheduled to report results. Additionally, crucial economic data, including existing home sales and the Consumer Price Index, are anticipated, despite delays caused by the government shutdown. These elements will shape market sentiment and investment strategies in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike impacting numerous Kaiser Permanente clinics and hospitals in California and Hawaii has ended, with the union, UNAC/UHCP, indicating renewed momentum for bargaining. The union sought a 25% wage increase over four years and increased staffing, emphasizing patient safety. Kaiser officials, however, argued their employees already earn 16% more than industry peers and offered a 21.5% wage increase, asserting that wages are the primary point of contention. Both parties are scheduled to resume negotiations later this week.</p>

          <p>A North Korean soldier successfully defected to South Korea by crossing the heavily fortified land border, with the South Korean military taking him into custody. The soldier expressed a desire to resettle in the South, marking a rare occurrence given the extreme security of the Demilitarized Zone. This event is the first reported defection by a North Korean soldier via the land border since August 2024, highlighting the persistent tensions between the two Koreas. Most defectors typically travel through China due to the border's formidable defenses.</p>
