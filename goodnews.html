          <p>China's new Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, aims to bolster the country's private economy by providing legal recourse for firms.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a policy change described as "radical." The policy would force vaccines to undergo studies in which half of the individuals in a study receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether that includes the flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned the safety of vaccines and argued that placebo-based trials are needed to ensure vaccines aren't doing more harm than good.</p>
