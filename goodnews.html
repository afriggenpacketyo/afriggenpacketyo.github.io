Chasing a target of 103, the Brave reached it with 17 balls to spare, showcasing a dominant performance. Key contributions included Sophie Devine's impressive 3-15 and a crucial 61-run partnership between Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Laura Wolvaardt, who finished unbeaten on 33. This victory marks a significant turnaround for the Brave, who finished at the bottom in 2024, now leading the league on net run-rate and demonstrating strong form early in the season.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly considering integrating Douyin Pay into its mainland App Store, reflecting the growing dominance of mobile payment services in China. This potential move would align Apple with local payment giants like Alipay and WeChat Pay, enhancing its presence in the world's second-largest economy. Concurrently, supposed leaked images of the iPhone 17, particularly a Pro model featuring a large horizontal camera "island," have ignited widespread online debate on Chinese social media. These images, initially posted mistakenly by Casetify, have fueled speculation and discussion about the future design direction of Apple's flagship smartphone, indicating strong consumer interest.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 08:51:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are finding attractive borrowing options through Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, which offer significantly lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of August 8, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.25% to 8.41% for various terms, while the average HELOC rate is 8.13%. These rates are expected to decline further with potential Federal Reserve cuts. While both products utilize home equity, HELOCs offer a revolving credit line with variable rates, whereas home equity loans provide a fixed-rate lump sum. Borrowers should compare offers and understand the collateral implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China's significant investment and leadership in green technologies, such as electric vehicles and clean energy, represent a "China Shock 2.0" that differs from past disruptions. Unlike the initial "China Shock" focused on manufacturing, this new wave involves building entirely new industries and systems. The author contends that China is not a destabilizer but a builder, driving down global clean energy costs by installing massive solar and wind capacities. This perspective challenges reflexive protectionism, suggesting that the 21st century will belong to those who lead the green transition, with China currently underwriting it.</p>

          <p>The iconic Barbie doll was surprisingly inspired by Bild Lilli, a German pin-up doll created in 1952 for the Bild tabloid newspaper, initially targeting male readers. Lilli, described as a "sensual" and "sassy secretary" (interpreted by some as a high-class call girl), quickly became a popular plastic doll sold in tobacco shops and bars, not originally intended for children. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered Lilli in Switzerland in 1956 and subsequently bought the rights, transforming Lilli's aesthetic into the world-renowned Barbie in 1959. This origin reveals Barbie's roots in a sexualized caricature before becoming a dominant children's toy and cultural phenomenon.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Refinancing Demand Surges as Rates Drop and Adjustable-Rate Loans Gain Popularity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 08:03:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage refinancing demand jumped 23% last week, marking its strongest period since April, driven by a slight decrease in average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to 6.67%. This surge in refinancing, alongside a 25% increase in adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) applications, indicates homeowners are actively seeking savings despite the riskier nature of ARMs. The average ARM rate fell to 5.80%, making them relatively more attractive. While refinancing soared, applications for new home purchases saw only a modest 1% rise, suggesting that lower rates primarily benefit existing homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China have achieved a significant breakthrough in atom-based quantum computing by building the world's largest array of atoms for this purpose. Their artificial intelligence system can arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms, each acting as a qubit, into perfect patterns in just 60,000th of a second. This advancement overcomes a major hurdle in atom-based quantum computing, which is considered highly promising due to the inherent stability and control of neutral atoms. The milestone is hailed as a significant leap forward in computational efficiency and experimental feasibility within atom-related quantum physics.</p>

          <p>A Vox panel on entrepreneurship highlighted key lessons for aspiring business owners, emphasizing the importance of practicality, vision, and authenticity. Speakers stressed the need to be analytical as a creative, especially when starting with limited funds, prioritizing products that generate revenue over purely artistic endeavors. They advised against excessive external advice, advocating for confidence in one's own brand vision, as customers ultimately buy what the creators are most proud of. The panel also noted that showing the "messy behind the scenes" and being real on social media can foster audience support, as people increasingly prefer to support small, authentic operations.</p>

Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan hailed the project as "groundbreaking," anticipating it will significantly boost visitor rates to the venue, from 7% to over 10%. Engineers utilized AI-powered "outpainting" to expand the classic film's frames for the Sphere's unique display, aiming to make viewers feel present during its original production. Despite a recent revenue miss, analysts remain optimistic about the film's potential as a major catalyst for the Sphere's future success.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is investing over $3 billion to expand its U.S. operations, shifting production of refrigerators, gas ranges, and water heaters from China and Mexico to plants in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina. This move, expected to create over 1,000 jobs, aligns with the company's strategy to manufacture closer to its customers and is partly influenced by President Trump's import tariffs. The investment builds on previous reshoring announcements, aiming to modernize plants and ramp up domestic production. Once fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and distribution network since 2016.</p>
