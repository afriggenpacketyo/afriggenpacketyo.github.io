          <p>Dozens of White South Africans arrived in the U.S. after the Trump administration granted them refugee status, citing "egregious discrimination." The South African government denies these claims, arguing that the land seizure law respects private property rights and targets unused land. The Trump administration has also clashed with South Africa over foreign policy, including its criticism of Israel, leading to a halt in aid. One refugee group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, declined to assist with resettlement, citing a commitment to racial justice, while others have indicated willingness.</p>

He stated the gift would go to the Defense Department, not him personally, and would be decommissioned for his presidential library. Democrats and watchdogs suggest the donation violates the emoluments clause and creates an incentive regarding Qatar, where Trump's company has projects. Trump invoked a golf analogy to justify accepting the gift, while Qatari officials stated the plan isn't finalized.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra has filed to run for governor, setting the stage for a possible tense primary contest in the GOP. The race is open due to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds' decision not to seek another term. Feenstra's entry could set up a high-profile primary that may include Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird. On the Democratic side, Iowa state auditor Rob Sand has also entered the race for governor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record $16.3 billion in April, boosted by President Trump's trade war. Customs duties rose 86% from March and more than doubled from a year ago. This surge in tariffs helped reduce the budget deficit for April, although the year-to-date deficit remains high. High interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>
