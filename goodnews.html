          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit aimed at signing a Gaza peace plan, brokered by US President Donald Trump. While Starmer plans to commend Trump's role, UK claims of significant involvement in shaping the plan have been disputed by US and Israeli officials. The summit seeks to solidify a ceasefire and advance towards a lasting peace after two years of conflict. This diplomatic gathering represents a crucial step in regional stability efforts.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, formalizes the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays. This clarification, which merely formalizes existing legal practice based on religious freedom, sparked public debate and tabloid headlines suggesting "extra holidays" for Muslims. Legal scholars and Islamic community leaders affirm it's not a new entitlement but an affirmation of equal treatment, reflecting Germany's evolving cultural identity. The article examines how different states handle religious observances and the broader conversation on integration.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos secured a narrow 13-11 victory over the New York Jets in a London game, extending the Jets' losing streak to 0-6. Despite the Broncos' Bo Nix throwing an early touchdown and Wil Lutz kicking a late go-ahead field goal, the game was marked by an extremely poor offensive performance from the Jets, who managed just 82 total net yards and a dismal minus-10 passing yards. Quarterback Justin Fields was sacked nine times, ultimately sealing their defeat. The article underscores the Jets' struggles and the Broncos' hard-fought win.</p>
