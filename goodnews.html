          <p>Rosa Chang, a Korean-born artist, is teaching Maryland Institute College of Art students the centuries-old tradition of indigo and natural dyes. Her class, "Mindful Colors: Natural Dyes from Korea and Beyond," explores the relationship between color and nature, using plants like indigo and marigold to create various hues. Chang, who grew tired of the toxic fabrics in the fashion industry, emphasizes indigo's cultural significance, rich history, and medicinal benefits, including its use by samurais to protect wounds. The students are working on final projects to preserve the tradition and capture the hues and historical processes they have learned in the class.</p>

In a previous game, Rodr√≠guez had an unfortunate play where a ball bounced off his glove for a Grisham home run.

          <p>A recent spate of bird deaths in a Bay Area neighborhood, initially attributed to exploding birds due to power lines, has been investigated by authorities. Residents reported finding dead birds after hearing loud pops, leading to concerns about electrocution. However, PG&E and the Department of Fish and Wildlife found no evidence of electrocution. Instead, the birds showed injuries consistent with trauma, suggesting the possibility of foul play involving a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. The investigation into the bird deaths is ongoing.</p>

          <p>An ethics complaint against Kentucky Republican Daniel Cameron has resurfaced as he campaigns for a U.S. Senate seat, alleging he solicited campaign donations improperly during his 2023 gubernatorial run. The state's Executive Branch Ethics Commission is investigating whether Cameron used his position as attorney general to influence a business owner to hold a fundraiser and solicit contributions. Cameron denounces the action as political persecution, while the commission says he requested a specific minimum contribution of $30,000. If found in violation, Cameron could face a civil penalty of up to $5,000.</p>

          <p>Despite facing a $12 billion budget deficit, California is committed to keeping state-funded health insurance for undocumented residents, though there will be cuts. Governor Gavin Newsom made a stand for undocumented Californians, emphasizing that the state has provided more support than any other in American history. However, due to the budget shortfall, the state will cap enrollment for undocumented adults in 2026 and add a $100 per month premium. While some criticize these rollbacks, Newsom's commitment reflects the state's values and recognition of the economic impact of undocumented immigrants.</p>
