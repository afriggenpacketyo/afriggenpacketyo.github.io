          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced that second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, increased by 67% to 19.53 billion Danish kroner. Despite this surge, the figure slightly missed analyst expectations, causing a minor dip in the company's share price. Following a recent downward revision of its full-year outlook, the company has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and enhance its commercial focus. The incoming CEO has emphasized a sense of urgency to drive high performance and growth for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines how the throw-in, a common football set-piece, remains a largely underutilized tactical resource in the Premier League. It recalls the era of Rory Delap's long throws for Stoke City as a rare example of a team weaponizing the situation. The piece suggests several innovations, such as specialized training for long-throw specialists and developing complex set-plays similar to corner routines. It also highlights the incredible advantage of the offside law not applying to throw-ins, a loophole that is seldom exploited by top clubs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, in a significant strategic shift for the company. CEO Sam Altman described the models as "the best and most usable" in the world, marking a direct challenge to the growing number of popular open-source models from China, such as Alibaba's Qwen family. This move represents a return to OpenAI's origins, as its last open model was released in 2019. Analysts see this as a competitive response, although China is still considered to lead in the sheer quantity of available open models.</p>

          <p>Seattle's upcoming mayoral election in November will feature a contest between incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell and longtime progressive activist Katie Wilson. The two secured the top spots in the city's nonpartisan primary, with Wilson narrowly leading Harrell with approximately 46% of the vote to his 45%. Wilson, known for co-founding the Transit Riders Union, is running on a progressive platform, while Harrell is viewed as the establishment candidate. The race is set to be a significant political battle, as Wilson aims to prevent Harrell from becoming the first Seattle mayor to win re-election in two decades.</p>

The region was one of 12 province-level areas targeted by Beijing in September 2023 for having risky debt levels that threatened financial stability. According to a local budget review, Inner Mongolia has successfully consolidated its finances and implemented debt resolution efforts. This development marks a significant milestone in China's broader campaign to rein in the unsustainable borrowing practices of its local governments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article examines the significant challenges faced by crossover athletes, like Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit, who attempt to transition to the NFL. It identifies two primary hurdles: the complexity of the NFL playbook and the sheer depth of athletic talent available in American football. Experts note that learning a playbook is intellectually demanding, comparable to studying law, and requires rapid application on the field. Furthermore, while an athlete may be elite in their original sport, they often face hundreds of similarly athletic competitors in the U.S. who have a lifetime of football experience.</p>

          <h2>China Strengthens Coffee Bean Imports from Africa Amid Growing Domestic Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 02:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Driven by a surge in domestic coffee consumption and a zero-tariff policy for certain African nations, China is increasing its efforts to secure coffee bean supply chains from the continent. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this push, signing agreements in top-producing countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to invest in local processing and procure large quantities of beans. This strategy allows China to "lock in supply" and diversify its sources, leveraging its growing market power. The move reflects a broader Chinese strategy of securing new overseas commodity supply lines.</p>

          <p>McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has expressed confidence that his drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will not have a major falling out as they compete for the Formula 1 championship. With Norris closing in on Piastri's lead, Brown acknowledged that tension will likely grow but believes the mutual trust and open communication within the team will prevent a destructive rivalry. He anticipates they might "swap paint again" but is positive they will not deliberately run each other off the track. Brown emphasized the importance of their long-term relationship, as both drivers are signed to multi-year contracts with the team.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan player David Martínez scored twice to lead Los Angeles FC to a 2-1 victory against Tigres UANL in a Leagues Cup match.

The result severely damages the qualification hopes for Tigres, a top Mexican club, leaving them on the verge of elimination from the tournament.

          <p>In his second game back from a knee injury, Max Muncy led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals with a powerful offensive performance. Muncy went four-for-five, driving in four runs and hitting two home runs, providing a much-needed spark to a Dodgers lineup that had struggled in his absence. His return is seen as a crucial boost for the team, which had been in a midseason slump and made limited offensive acquisitions at the trade deadline. Other slumping hitters, including Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández, also showed signs of breaking out in the win.</p>

          <p>China is facing a shortage of launch rockets as it races to build satellite internet constellations to compete with SpaceX's Starlink, creating a potential conflict between national and local projects. The national priority project, Guo Wang, has recently accelerated its launch schedule, utilizing multiple state-owned Long March rockets. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, to seek launches from the private sector. Qianfan recently issued a tender for seven private rocket launches, highlighting the capacity constraints within China's state-run space program as it pursues its strategic goals.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early; they will be transferred to other institutions. The closure raises questions about the future of the property, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel before being converted into a prison.</p>
