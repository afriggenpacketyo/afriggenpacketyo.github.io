          <h2>Proxima Fusion Secures Record Funding to Develop Nuclear Fusion Power Plant</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round, the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date, with the goal of developing the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Investors Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital co-led the round, expressing optimism about the technology's potential role in the energy transition. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, involves jamming together two hydrogen atoms to form one helium atom, releasing massive amounts of power. Proxima Fusion's CEO, Francesco Sciortino, believes nuclear fusion is the "ultimate" source of clean energy and "inevitable" for humanity, with the funding enabling the company to pursue its goals for the next few years. The successful replication of nuclear fusion at an industrial scale could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy. </p>

Quantum computers use qubits, which can be zero, one, or something in between, to process vast amounts of data for breakthroughs in medicine, science, and finance. Huang believes the application of quantum computers to solve interesting problems is within reach in the coming years, marking an exciting time for the technology. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will celebrate its 250th anniversary with a festival and parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, which coincides with President Trump's 79th birthday. The event is expected to include approximately 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, and over 50 aircraft, with hundreds of thousands of attendees anticipated. The parade route will run along Constitution Avenue, and will feature different eras of the Army's history, showcasing corresponding uniforms and equipment. Army officials estimate the event could cost between $25-45 million, with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll stating that it presents an "amazing opportunity" to tell the Army's story and boost recruitment. The last military parade in D.C. was in 1991 to mark the end of the Gulf War. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seattle is striving to balance the need for increased housing density with the preservation of trees to address climate change impacts. A new state law requires more housing density, but the city is working to ensure trees are not sacrificed in the process. The Bryant Heights development exemplifies this approach, integrating 86 housing units while preserving over 30 trees. Preserving trees requires extra negotiations with the city, such as proving new construction will not harm them and using porous concrete for walkways to allow water to reach the roots. Despite efforts to preserve the urban canopy, Seattle's tree coverage has slightly decreased, prompting the city to plant more trees in parks and require care for newly planted trees. </p>

          <p>Homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses against disasters, with states developing insurance discount programs modeled after Alabama's. Alabama's program encourages homeowners to strengthen their houses against disasters, such as using stronger building materials to withstand storms. Homeowners can qualify for discounts of 20% to 35% off the wind portion of their insurance by meeting the FORTIFIED Roof standard. While such programs are newer in states like California, they offer smaller discounts, often less than 10%, for fire-proofing homes. Disaster experts emphasize the importance of retrofitting homes to withstand extreme weather, with insurance companies taking this into account when offering coverage. </p>

          <p>A fire-proofing demonstration in Anaheim showcased the effectiveness of wildfire defense strategies, offering lessons for Pacific Palisades and Altadena as they rebuild after the January fires. The demonstration pitted two tiny homes against a fire, one built to typical standards and the other employing fire-mitigation techniques. The unprotected home was quickly engulfed in flames, while the fire-prepared home remained unscathed due to a perimeter of cement pavers, gravel, and no bushes against the house. Fire-prevention specialists emphasize the importance of Zone 0, the first five feet of defensible space surrounding a structure, to stop a fire in its tracks. </p>

          <h2>South Korea Halts Propaganda Broadcasts to North Korea</h2>

          <p>South Korea's military has suspended its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea in an effort to "restore trust" between the two countries. The move follows the election of new president Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean ties. Pyongyang has historically considered these broadcasts an act of war and has threatened to destroy the loudspeakers. The broadcasts, which had been paused for six years before resuming last June, included news, information on democracy, and details about life in South Korea. While human rights advocates have criticized the suspension, residents along the border have welcomed the move. </p>
