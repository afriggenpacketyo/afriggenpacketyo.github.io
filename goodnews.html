          <p>Home Depot's stock experienced a significant rally despite narrowly missing analyst expectations for its fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by strong underlying business momentum. Management reaffirmed its full-year guidance, noting that 12 out of 16 product categories achieved positive comparable sales, marking the best performance in over two years. Investors are positioning themselves ahead of anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which are expected to stimulate the housing market, increase renovation activity, and shift consumer mindsets. The article suggests that delaying investment until rates actually decline may mean missing the opportune moment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A California family, Anteres Anderson Turner and Louis Turner, found a heartwarming solution to their desire for grandparental involvement by connecting with Janet Firestein Daw through the "Surrogate Grandparents USA" Facebook group. With their own parents either distant or uninvolved, the couple sought to recreate the supportive "village" they experienced in their youth for their twin boys, Caden and Cameron. Two years after their initial meeting, Firestein Daw, affectionately known as "Nana J," has become an integral part of the family, filling a lifelong void for her and bringing a profound sense of completeness to the Turners.

          <p>Despite previous skepticism from figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding the role of women in the military, all combat positions remain open to female soldiers, a policy proving crucial for recruitment in a competitive labor market. Unexpectedly, TikTok, an app Congress has attempted to ban on national security grounds, has emerged as a significant aid in attracting new recruits. This article explores the evolving dynamics within the US armed forces, highlighting how modern social media platforms are playing an increasingly important, albeit controversial, role in shaping the future of military personnel and their public image.</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour is set to make its highly anticipated return to Donald Trump’s iconic Blue Monster course at Trump National Doral in Miami for the Miami Championship in May 2026. This $20 million Signature Event marks the first time in a decade that the Tour will host an event at a Trump-owned property, following its departure in 2016. While the previous relocation was officially attributed to sponsorship issues, it coincided with Trump's initial presidential campaign. The return signifies a new chapter for the PGA Tour, expanding its elite event schedule and bringing top-tier golf back to a historic venue.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has reaffirmed its AA+ rating for long-term US sovereign debt, projecting that substantial federal revenue generated from President Donald Trump's comprehensive tariff policies will largely compensate for anticipated weaker revenue from his recently enacted tax-and-spending bill. However, the credit rating agency issued a cautionary note, indicating that the rating could face downward pressure in the next two to three years if escalating deficits persist or if political developments undermine the strength of American institutions, including the Federal Reserve's independence. Such factors, it warned, could potentially jeopardize the dollar's global reserve currency status.</p>

Lutnick underscored the critical importance of bolstering domestic chip production to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers like TSMC. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent further clarified that this stake would not compel US businesses to purchase Intel chips, emphasizing a focus on strengthening the national semiconductor industry.</p>
