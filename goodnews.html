          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. Japan ranked 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index, the lowest among G7 nations. The government plans to intensify efforts to promote gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making roles, focusing on local economies and small businesses and addressing the female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Faced with increasing import tariffs from the US, Chinese manufacturers are expanding their exports to Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Exports to these countries have risen by double-digit percentages in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factories in Southeast Asia for local sale or re-export to Western countries, including the US. While some exports may be transshipped to avoid US tariffs, factories often incorporate enough local content to declare re-exports as made in the respective Southeast Asian countries.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to curb the elevated prices of the country's staple food. This release, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons. The move is intended to supply smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops, as well as major retailers, with the farm ministry beginning to accept applications on Wednesday. The government hopes that the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices, addressing public frustration over the soaring cost of rice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have experienced a significant decline, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. The trend is particularly notable among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and increased awareness of the dangers of fentanyl. While the improvement is dramatic, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction services could jeopardize the progress.</p>
