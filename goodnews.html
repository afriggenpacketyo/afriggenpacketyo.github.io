          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a method for savers to protect their money's buying power. This article outlines current national average CD rates and contrasts them with higher rates available from online banks and for shorter-term CDs. It explains the concept of an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of the current rate environment. The piece emphasizes that CDs offer a safe, insured way to lock in returns that can outpace inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has successfully raised $10 billion in a combination of debt and equity, according to Morgan Stanley. This significant capital infusion will be used to develop infrastructure, including a massive supercomputer in Memphis, and enhance its AI chatbot, Grok. The funding intensifies the competition in the AI sector, positioning xAI to more directly challenge industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic. Musk aims to differentiate Grok as a "maximally truth-seeking" and "anti-woke" AI, which is integrated with the social media platform X to boost its adoption.</p>

          <p>While U.S. consumer spending on most luxury goods fell in the first five months of the year, the jewelry category has been a notable exception, consistently outperforming other sectors. A Citi report analyzing credit card data shows that spending on luxury jewelry surged 10.1% year-over-year in May, and it was the only luxury category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this resilience is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, its sentimental value, and the recent run-up in gold prices, making it a more attractive purchase than other high-end items.

The nationwide operation resulted in criminal charges against 324 defendants, including 93 doctors and medical professionals, with an actual loss to the government of about $2.9 billion. Officials noted the increasing complexity of these crimes, with some schemes run by transnational criminal organizations using stolen American identities to submit fraudulent claims for medical supplies.

          <p>A long-lost novel titled "Parting," written in 1932 by the then-24-year-old journalist Sebastian Haffner, has become an unexpected bestseller in Germany. The manuscript was discovered by the author's son after his death in 1999 but was only published recently, nearly a quarter-century later. Haffner, who fled Nazi Germany, is renowned for his incisive historical and political analysis, particularly his memoir "Defying Hitler." The rediscovered novel, an autobiographical love story set against the backdrop of the collapsing Weimar Republic, offers a lighter, more hopeful tone that contrasts with the doom of his later non-fiction works.</p>
