Petrova had been detained after customs officials questioned her about the samples at Boston Logan International Airport.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have been consistently rising and may continue to do so in June due to factors like slowing inflation progress, frozen interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Investors often turn to gold as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, potentially driving prices higher. Experts suggest considering fractional gold investments or dollar-cost averaging to manage the high price. While predicting gold prices is difficult, these factors suggest a potential for continued growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) experienced significant inflows after SharpLink Gaming Inc. (SBET) announced plans to raise capital to purchase Ether. SharpLink's rally evoked comparisons to MicroStrategy Inc., now rebranded as Strategy Inc., which famously transformed itself into a Bitcoin holding company. The potential for a similar strategy with Ether has intrigued investors, offering a catalyst for the cryptocurrency, which has underperformed Bitcoin this cycle. Whether SharpLink can replicate Strategy's success remains to be seen, but the announcement has sparked renewed interest in Ether ETFs (not investment advice).</p>
