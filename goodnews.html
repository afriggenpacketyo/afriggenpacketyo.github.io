        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea has unexpectedly canceled Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich following a significant hamstring injury to fellow striker Liam Delap during a recent match. The decision has reportedly angered Jackson, who was already in Germany for his medical examination when the club recalled him to London. This sudden reversal highlights Chelsea's precarious striker situation, as they were left with only one fit forward after a series of departures and Delap's injury. The club is now attempting to navigate the fallout of the collapsed deal while addressing the team's immediate needs for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The third-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes secured a 14-7 victory over the top-ranked Texas Longhorns, largely due to a formidable defensive performance that stifled Texas quarterback Arch Manning. In his first career road start, Manning struggled against the Buckeyes' defense, with the majority of his 170 passing yards coming late in the fourth quarter. The game remained a defensive battle until Ohio State scored touchdowns in the second and fourth quarters. This victory solidifies Ohio State's position as a national title contender, while Texas will look to rebound in its upcoming games after the tough loss.</p>

          <p>According to financial analyst Jim Cramer, cloud provider CoreWeave, Inc. is positioned as a major beneficiary of the high demand for NVIDIA's artificial intelligence GPUs. Cramer noted that CoreWeave's stock rose significantly following NVIDIA's strong earnings report, emphasizing the company's crucial role in acquiring and assembling NVIDIA's advanced chips for AI firms. He explained that companies cannot simply buy NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs directly but must often work through assemblers like CoreWeave. This strategic position makes the company integral to the AI hardware supply chain and a focal point for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rising cricket star Davina Perrin, who is just under 19 years old, delivered a sensational performance by scoring a century off only 42 balls in The Hundred tournament. Her innings of 101 from 43 balls, which included 15 fours and five sixes, guided her team, the Northern Superchargers, into the final at Lord's. This achievement makes Perrin the first Black British woman to score a professional T20 century. Her remarkable talent and composure have drawn high praise, with commentators suggesting she has the potential to become a dominant force in international women's cricket and an important role model.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex issue of determining safe screen time limits for children, synthesizing advice from pediatricians, psychologists, and media educators. For very young children, experts recommend minimal to no screen time, emphasizing real-world exploration and interaction for crucial cognitive and social development. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and supervised use, with recommendations increasing from 30 minutes in kindergarten to about two hours for older teenagers. Parents are advised to maintain open communication, set clear rules, and prioritize activities that foster imagination, motor skills, and social interaction.</p>

          <p>Health officials in New York City have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the disease.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. A UK-based study involving over 12,000 patients demonstrated that the AI tool significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The device analyzes subtle heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI for analysis. Experts believe this technology could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner and potentially saving lives, with plans for a wider rollout underway.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, stars Peter Dinklage as a janitor who transforms into a mutant vigilante after being exposed to toxic waste. This updated version retains the gratuitous gore and dark humor of the original Troma film but presents it with higher production values and a well-known cast including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The story centers on the hero, Toxie, as he seeks revenge on a corrupt pharmaceutical company. The review suggests that while the film is an entertaining and well-made homage, its polished nature may feel disconnected from the intentionally cheap and chaotic spirit of the original.</p>

Kidjo's powerful stage presence transformed classical and popular songs, including works by Ravel and Gershwin, with African languages and rhythms.

          <p>This article provides guidance on Social Security survivor benefits for individuals whose spouses have passed away. It clarifies that while you cannot collect both your own retirement benefits and survivor benefits simultaneously, you can strategically choose which one to receive at different times to maximize your income. For example, a surviving spouse can claim survivor benefits as early as age 60 and then switch to their own, potentially larger, retirement benefit at full retirement age or later. The article outlines the eligibility requirements and suggests consulting a financial advisor to navigate the complexities of these important decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
