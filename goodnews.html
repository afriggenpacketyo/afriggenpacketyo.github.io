Hageman was advocating for a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, citing concerns about sewage dumping by Mexico near San Diego, California. Critics quickly pointed out the geographical inaccuracy, as San Diego is over 1,200 miles away from the Gulf and faces the Pacific Ocean.</p>
