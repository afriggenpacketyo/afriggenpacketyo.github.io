          <p>Morocco is emerging as a crucial hub for Chinese companies seeking to bypass tariffs on exports to Europe, thanks to its free-trade agreement with the European Union. Chinese investment in Morocco's energy and electric vehicle sectors has surged, positioning the country as a key node in the evolving global trading system. However, this has created a delicate balancing act for Morocco, as it must navigate growing tensions between China and the United States to protect its economic and geopolitical interests. This New York Times article explores Morocco's strategic role and the challenges it faces in the midst of the trade war.</p>

          <p>Five top Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering at the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have been rescued and are now in the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the news, stating that the "Venezuelan heroes" were now safe following a precise operation. The activists had been running a presidential campaign from the embassy and sought asylum after Venezuela's attorney general announced warrants for their arrest. This article from The New York Times highlights the ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and the Trump administration's efforts to secure the activists' release.</p>

          <p>Criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison under a new bill. The legislation aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice and ensures they face the consequences of their actions. Victims' families have expressed support for the bill, stating that it provides a moment of recognition and reparation. The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>

          <p>The Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed in a recent fire, will now be included in the federally funded debris removal program, offering residents a step closer to returning home. The decision follows weeks of uncertainty for the owners and residents of the 158 homes, and the federal assistance will help clear the properties. The determination of who would pay for the debris removal has been a major factor in deciding whether to rebuild Tahitian Terrace, with the owners citing the high cost of cleanup.</p>

          <p>China's tourism sector is experiencing a surge, driven by growing interest in history and culture, even as overall consumption slows. Domestic tourist trips have increased significantly, surpassing pre-COVID levels, with young Chinese tourists prioritizing museums and cultural activities. The improved transportation infrastructure, including high-speed trains, is encouraging visits to smaller cities, and rural tourism is also on the rise. While retail sales remain tepid, the services sector, including tourism, is seeing faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to hold trade talks this weekend in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the focus will be on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal. The United States seeks to agree with China on future discussion topics, particularly regarding "strategic industries" like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and steel. This high-level in-person contact marks the first between representatives of the world's two largest economies since President Donald Trump imposed hefty tariffs on imports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dodgers suffered a 5-4 extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins, highlighting concerns about their overworked bullpen. With key relievers having already pitched multiple times on the road trip, manager Dave Roberts was forced to rely on less experienced arms. This decision ultimately led to a walk-off single by Jes√∫s Sanchez in the bottom of the 10th inning. The article emphasizes the need for the Dodgers to address their bullpen depth to avoid similar situations in the future.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has partnered with Throne Labs to install four "smart" public restrooms throughout the city as part of a pilot program. The units, which include a toilet, urinal, and sink, are accessed via QR codes or physical access cards. To prevent loitering, the restrooms have a 10-minute time limit, after which the doors automatically open. The city is evaluating the program based on usage data, user experience, and cost analysis to determine whether to continue using the smart toilets.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with President Trump, the Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, asserted his country's independence, stating, "There are some places that are never for sale." This came after months of Trump's rhetoric about potentially making Canada the 51st state. The meeting, while seemingly friendly, was laden with underlying tensions and awkwardness stemming from Trump's previous remarks and actions. Trump, while attempting to downplay the situation, covered a wide range of unrelated topics, seemingly avoiding the complications his previous statements had created.</p>

          <p>A plant in China's Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from China‚Äôs low-grade ore that was previously unusable. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This could significantly reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia. IB2, a green tech company, signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology.</p>
