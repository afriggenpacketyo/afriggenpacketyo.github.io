          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to investigate the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This research aims to better understand and predict "space weather," which can disrupt critical systems like GPS, communication networks, and power grids. The satellites will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The mission also deployed several other small satellites for various scientific and technological experiments, including testing 5G communications in space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In what is being called the largest operation of its kind, Mexican authorities have dismantled a massive extortion network with ties to a major drug cartel. The criminal group operated across 14 municipalities in the State of Mexico, controlling labor unions and extorting numerous companies and individuals. The crackdown, involving nearly 3,000 security personnel, led to eight arrests and the seizure of stolen goods, exotic animals, and vehicles. This operation highlights the government's effort to combat the pervasive issue of cartel extortion, which has expanded beyond drug trafficking into many sectors of the local economy.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Slovenian System That Forged Tour de France Champion Tadej Pogacar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:59:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovenia's remarkable success in sports, exemplified by cyclist Tadej Pogacar, is attributed to a robust national system that promotes physical fitness and literacy from a young age. According to Professor Gregor Jurak of the University of Ljubljana, the country's high-quality physical education in schools, strong parental involvement, and diverse geography create an ideal environment for athletic development. A national fitness monitoring program called SLOfit, in use since 1987, helps identify and nurture talent. This structured environment, combined with natural ability, is seen as the key to producing world-class athletes like Pogacar from a nation of just two million people.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has launched a "24-Hour Economy" policy aimed at transforming the nation's economy from import-based to self-sufficient and creating widespread employment. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping the economy active around the clock through a collaboration between public and private sectors. While the vision is to create over 1.7 million jobs and boost GDP, experts raise concerns about its feasibility. Hurdles include securing the necessary multi-billion dollar funding, overcoming infrastructure challenges like power supply, and ensuring private sector buy-in for such a major operational shift.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new range of beverages, including cold brews, refreshers, and flavored sodas, in over 500 U.S. restaurants. The move is an effort to attract younger consumers and compete with beverage-focused chains like Dutch Bros. and Swig. This strategy follows the company's decision to shutter its standalone CosMc's drink-centric locations, instead incorporating the successful concepts from the spinoff into its main restaurants. The test aims to gauge customer preferences and operational feasibility as McDonald's seeks to boost lackluster sales and drive more traffic during different parts of the day.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst forecasts and causing its shares to jump over 9%. The German lender affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from a stronger euro. While revenue from fixed income and currencies was strong, the origination and advisory division saw a decline due to market uncertainty. The positive results come as European banks navigate a lower interest rate environment and potential trade tariff turmoil with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed he is launching a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. In a joint statement, they called for "a real, democratic alternative" and invited supporters to an inaugural conference to shape the party's direction. The new entity is expected to position itself to the left of the current Labour Party, focusing on issues like wealth redistribution, nationalization of key industries, and a halt to UK arms sales to Israel. This move could potentially impact the UK's political landscape by splitting the left-leaning vote.</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed what they are calling a landmark free trade agreement, the largest such deal for Britain since Brexit. The agreement is set to lower tariffs on a wide range of goods, including British exports like whisky and cars, and Indian exports such as textiles and seafood. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the deal will create over 2,200 British jobs and sends a message that Britain is open for business. The agreement also includes closer collaboration on defense, technology, and tackling organized crime, though talks on financial services access are ongoing.</p>

          <p>After four decades, an arrest has been made in the 1984 murder of 18-year-old Terrance Arndt and the sexual assault of his female companion in Northern California. Police arrested 64-year-old Roger Neil Schmidt Sr. in Arizona after using forensic genetic genealogy to link his DNA to evidence from the crime scene. At the time of the attack, the two teenagers were parked in a car when the suspect shot Arndt and assaulted the female victim. The breakthrough in the cold case provides a long-awaited resolution for the victims' families and the community, which was deeply affected by the crime.</p>

          <p>Juliet Schor, a lead researcher on global four-day workweek trials, reports that the experiments have yielded surprising benefits beyond expectations. In studies involving hundreds of companies, employees not only experienced less burnout and better health but also reported a significant jump in their own productivity and well-being. This challenges the assumption that people would simply work faster; instead, the entire company's work process is reorganized more efficiently. Schor notes that despite these positive outcomes, widespread adoption is slow due to managerial reluctance to cede control and the perceived risk of such a radical change.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as backyard cottages or garage apartments. The legislation would authorize government-backed second mortgages specifically for ADU projects, a financing option that is currently rare. By allowing lenders to consider projected rental income and post-construction home value, the bill aims to help lower- and middle-income households build ADUs. Proponents argue this could help alleviate the national housing shortage by boosting supply, though local zoning restrictions remain a major barrier.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable target than the popular 10,000-step goal, is associated with significant health benefits. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, found that this level of activity was linked to a reduced risk of dementia, heart disease, cancer, and depression. The widely-known 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan and is not based on scientific evidence. Researchers hope these findings will encourage more people to use step-tracking as a practical way to improve their long-term health.</p>
