          <p>China is developing its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint for its national development, which will influence infrastructure spending and investment. While past plans, like the 2009 stimulus package, spurred economic growth through massive public works, they also contributed to local government debt. The upcoming iteration is expected to focus on more tech-driven and people-centric projects, as officials seek to balance continued investment with addressing financial pressures and evolving societal demands.

          <p>OpenAI's rapid ascent to a $500 billion valuation, driven by massive deals and product rollouts, is creating an unprecedented dominance in Silicon Valley. Unlike previous tech giants, OpenAI's private status and immense capital expenditure make its strategy opaque and challenging for startups to navigate. The company is investing across the AI stack, from data centers to consumer apps, leading to a "gold rush mentality" but also concerns about competition for niche players. This era is marked by extraordinary speed and capital exuberance, with OpenAI at its forefront. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision comes despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's previous assertion that he cannot imagine a second independence vote during his premiership.
