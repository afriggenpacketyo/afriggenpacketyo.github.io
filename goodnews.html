          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle. Initially, these robotaxis will operate with human safety drivers behind the wheel to manually gather data before the company validates the technology for fully autonomous services. This expansion follows Waymo's commercial operations in cities like Austin, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The company will deploy up to a dozen vehicles in each new city, utilizing its electric Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr models for the tests.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled on the penalties for Google's illegal monopoly in the online search market, ordering the company to end exclusive default search engine contracts but stopping short of forcing a sale of its Chrome browser. The ruling, by District Judge Amit Mehta, addresses the company's anticompetitive practices by requiring it to share some search data with rivals to foster competition. This decision concludes the remedies phase of a landmark antitrust case initiated by the Department of Justice in 2020, which found Google had unlawfully maintained its dominance in online search.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling on its landmark antitrust case. Investors reacted positively as the decision did not require Google to sell its lucrative Chrome browser, a penalty the Department of Justice had sought. While the ruling bars Google from engaging in exclusive contracts to be the default search engine, it allows the company to continue making payments for product placement. The market's relief reflects a sentiment that the penalties are manageable and not as severe as they could have been for the tech giant.</p>

          <p>Aircraft leasing company Air Lease has agreed to be sold to a group of investors, including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital, in a $7.4 billion deal that will take the company private. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, highlights a trend of consolidation within the airplane-renting industry. The leasing business has become crucial for airlines, owning over half the world's passenger jets, as carriers seek to conserve cash. The deal comes as a shortage of new aircraft has driven rental rates to record highs.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers at two of California's most prominent national parks, Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon, have voted overwhelmingly to form a union. The move to join the National Federation of Federal Employees comes amid significant turmoil within the National Park Service, which has faced unprecedented staff and budget cuts under the Trump administration. Organizers stated that the mass firings and difficult working conditions provided the necessary support for the unionization effort, which will now represent 600 employees including park rangers, scientists, and first responders.</p>

          <p>The rapper Drake has placed a $300,000 bet on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to win the US Open, a wager that would pay out over half a million dollars. Drake is famously associated with the "Drake Curse," a phenomenon where athletes or teams he supports often suffer unexpected losses. His betting history in tennis includes a losing wager on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in a previous US Open final. Despite his track record, the Canadian artist continues to place high-profile bets on major sporting events, adding a layer of cultural theater to the competitions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high interest rates making credit card debt increasingly expensive, managing a significant balance like $20,000 requires a clear strategy. Financial experts suggest several methods, including working with a debt relief company for management or settlement programs, which can negotiate lower rates. Another option is a debt consolidation loan, which combines multiple debts into a single payment, often at a lower interest rate. Individuals can also adopt payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" (paying highest interest first) or "debt snowball" (paying smallest balance first) to systematically eliminate their debt.

          <p>President Trump has announced his decision to relocate the headquarters of U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama. This move reverses a Biden administration decision to keep the command in Colorado Springs, which was made over concerns that a move could risk military readiness. Trump, joined by Alabama senators, argued the relocation to "Rocket City" would bring jobs and investment while helping the U.S. dominate space. The decision carries political undertones, moving the headquarters from a state that has become more Democratic to a reliably Republican one.</p>

          <p>Contrary to prevalent narratives of rampant violence, Chicago is experiencing a significant drop in violent crime this year. Robberies in the city have decreased by a third compared to the previous year, and the city is on pace to record its lowest murder rate in over a decade. While President Trump recently referred to the city as a "disaster," the data suggests a notable improvement in public safety. The article also notes that violence has historically been concentrated in specific neighborhoods, with tourist areas remaining largely safe from gun-related crime.</p>
