          <p>As the Latin Recording Academy prepares to announce its 26th annual nominations, industry experts are predicting a big year for artists like Bad Bunny and Natalia Lafourcade. Bad Bunny's album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” is being hailed as a decade-defining work for its artistic ambition and fusion of genres like salsa and plena. Meanwhile, Lafourcade's “Cancionera” is praised for its mature, mystical quality and is seen as a strong, if more traditional, contender. Other notable artists expected to receive nominations include Rauw Alejandro, Cazzu, and Fuerza Regida, reflecting a vibrant and diverse year in Latin music.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 season in the central Pacific Ocean. The storm is currently located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Honolulu and is not considered an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week. The storm is projected to continue moving westward, remaining well south of Hawaii, providing a safe distance from any potential impact on the islands.</p>

          <p>China's aviation authority is assessing the country's airlines' demand for new Boeing jets, signaling a potential warming of trade relations with the United States. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has asked carriers to update their fleet plans, specifically inquiring about overdue Boeing orders. This move follows a meeting between the CAAC director and a senior Boeing executive to discuss expanding cooperation. Industry insiders suggest that if a broader trade deal is reached between the two nations, the American aerospace giant could be a primary beneficiary of the improved diplomatic climate.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking to flee Gaza has achieved a significant legal victory in the United Kingdom. The High Court ruled that the foreign secretary must reconsider the government's refusal to help the family, who are living in a tent and are at "constant risk of injury or death." The family, who has a British relative, was granted permission to come to the UK in January but has been unable to leave Gaza. The Foreign Office had denied assistance based on a policy that limits such help to exceptional cases, a stance the judge said must be re-evaluated given the family's circumstances.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant rise after the European Union committed to purchasing $750 billion worth of energy from the United States.

The massive energy purchase is a key component of a broader trade agreement between the U.S. and the EU. EU President Ursula von der Leyen stated the deal will help diversify Europe's energy supply and reduce its long-standing dependence on Russian natural gas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California has admitted its largest-ever class of California undergraduates for the fall 2025 term, with offers going to 100,947 first-year students. The data also shows a 17% increase in admission offers to international students, a strategic move to offset potential enrollment declines due to fee hikes and stricter visa processes. The admitted class maintains strong racial diversity, with Latinos being the largest group for the sixth consecutive year. The growth in admissions comes as the UC system faces significant budgetary challenges, including a hiring freeze and deferred state funding.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 4% Rule and its Relevance to Annuities for Retirees</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 4% rule is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting they can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings over 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. An annuity might offer a higher payout rate, providing protection against outliving one's savings, but often lacks the inflation adjustments and flexibility of a traditional portfolio. Financial experts suggest a hybrid approach, using annuities for essential expenses and investments for discretionary spending, can balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has presented a European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal was developed in coordination with leaders from France and Germany following the breakdown of U.S.-led peace talks. Details of the plan have not been released, but it aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a pathway to a sustainable two-state solution. The move comes amid increasing domestic and international pressure on the UK to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, a step supported by over half of Labour's backbench MPs.</p>
