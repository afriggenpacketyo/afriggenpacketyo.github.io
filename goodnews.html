          <h2>Trump Softens Tone Towards Canada During Meeting with Prime Minister Carney</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:12:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump adopted a surprisingly amiable tone during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite previously criticizing Canada. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, citing personal connections and downplaying earlier rhetoric about potentially incorporating Canada as the 51st state. Carney, however, firmly asserted Canada's independence and rejected any suggestion of a merger, emphasizing the importance of the partnership between the two countries. The meeting covered various topics, including trade and global issues, but tensions remained evident beneath the surface, particularly regarding tariffs and border policies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a leading aluminium producer and consumer, relies heavily on imported bauxite due to the low quality of its domestic ore. However, French technology developed by Yves Ocello of IB2 offers a solution by transforming low-grade bauxite into high-quality material suitable for aluminium production. This technology neutralizes silica and sulphur, enabling the use of the Bayer process for refining high-silica bauxite. IB2 has signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement this technology, potentially reducing China's dependence on imported aluminium ore.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is not for sale after Trump romanticized the idea of the U.S. acquiring Canada. Carney used real estate terminology to emphasize that some places are not for sale. Trump, despite the rejection, insisted on the possibility and congratulated Carney on his recent victory. Discussions about trade and tariffs continued, with Carney emphasizing the need to convince the Trump administration that tariffs harm American jobs and the economy.</p>

          <p>Air traffic control audio captured the moment controllers lost radar and radio signals while guiding planes to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey last week. The outage lasted approximately 90 seconds, leaving controllers unable to see, hear, or talk to aircraft under their control. The incident occurred before massive delays and cancellations at Newark Airport. The FAA addressed staffing shortages as a contributing factor, stating that they continue to train controllers to be assigned to the busy airspace.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a new law that will make it a criminal offense to climb on the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. The law, part of the Crime and Policing Bill, aims to protect war memorials from desecration, with offenders facing potential imprisonment and fines. The decision follows several incidents of demonstrators targeting the statue in recent years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed his support for the new protection, emphasizing Churchill's significance as a national hero.</p>
