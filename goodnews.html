        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three men, who had been granted temporary leave to remain in the UK after claiming asylum, have been charged under the National Security Act for allegedly targeting journalists working for Iran International, a London-based media organization critical of the Iranian regime. The men are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service, specifically Iran, in carrying out UK-related activities, with one of the men also charged with intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that Iran must be held accountable for its actions and emphasized the need to strengthen national security powers. The defendants have been remanded in custody and are scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey on June 6th.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years in a reciprocal arrangement. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia. The EU has reportedly been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is considering a shorter duration. Universities and students have noted that Brexit has made studying in the UK less attractive, as EU students now generally have to pay international fees. The first talks since Brexit will include discussions on fishing rights.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have made advances in plasma excitation technology that can significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones, according to a new study. Wind tunnel tests showed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could boost an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 percent, a metric indicating superior flight efficiency. This technology could potentially extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones. The research was conducted by a team at the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC).</p>

          <p>During a tour of the Middle East, President Trump announced multibillion-dollar tech deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. These agreements involve the sale of advanced U.S. technology and concentrate power in the hands of a few tech CEOs. The deals, negotiated face-to-face with Gulf country leaders, break with the Biden administration's strict controls on selling cutting-edge tech to Middle Eastern powers due to their links with China. Elon Musk's presence on the trip highlighted his influence, as Starlink inked an agreement for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and avid runner, experienced years of worsening calf pain before finally being diagnosed with Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed by muscles and tendons. After an initial bypass surgery failed, Prindle found a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic who performed a surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles. The surgeries corrected Prindle's legs and have allowed her to return to a semblance of a normal life. Prindle hopes her story inspires others to push for answers when they know something is wrong.</p>

          <p>An original copy of the Magna Carta has been rediscovered in the files of the Harvard Law School library, where it had been resting for decades. Purchased for just $27.50 in 1946, the document was identified as an original through spectral imaging and other tests. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people, including royalty, had personal rights and that even kings had to abide by laws. The rediscovered document is dated to the final iteration of the Magna Carta in 1300, and is one of only 24 original documents that survive today.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is facing increased competition from other locations offering financial incentives, leading to a decline in film and TV production in the area. President Trump has proposed tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. to address this issue, but industry leaders are advocating for federal tax incentives to encourage domestic production. States within the U.S. are also competing for production business, with New York and New Jersey increasing their production incentives. The situation is dire, with concerns that California could lose its status as the entertainment capital of the world if action is not taken.</p>

          <p>Manvir Singh's new book, "Shamanism: The Timeless Religion," explores the widespread phenomenon of shamanism, defining a shaman as a specialist who engages with unseen realities through non-ordinary states to provide services like healing and divination. The shaman's journey is archetypal, involving encounters with demons, sky flights, and underworld plunges, ultimately returning with new capabilities. The author argues that shamanism is a "compelling technology for dealing with uncertainty," interceding on our behalf in the face of chaos. The connection between shamanism and conspiracy theory is explored, highlighting the belief in another order of reality populated with entities, where the shaman possesses the power to change the weather or reverse curses.</p>

Toyota and Honda project significant profit declines due to the 25% tariff that took effect on April 3. While raising prices could ease the pressure on profitability, the strategy risks driving away customers. Toyota will focus on local development and production in the medium and long term, and consider redirecting vehicles to other markets in the short term.

          <p>An "Alternative Device Fair" in Westport, Connecticut, showcased intentionally limited-functionality phones for families concerned about the impact of smartphones and social media, particularly on children. The devices, mostly generic-looking smartphones, offer restricted app stores and advanced parental-control features, blocking social media access. The event reflected a broader concern about social media's effects on children and teenagers, and a desire to push back against the trend of giving iPhones as elementary-school graduation presents. The options on display balanced the benefits of connectivity with protection from harmful content, such as violent videos, messages from creeps, and the urge to endlessly scroll.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board expresses its support for Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and his efforts to combat the rising popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD, known for its extremist views and ties to Russia, finished second in the recent parliamentary elections. The board emphasizes the importance of Merz's leadership in addressing key issues such as migration and the economy to prevent Germany from sliding into right-wing populism. The editorial also points to the need for stricter immigration policies and for Germany to address its lack of innovation and struggling economy.</p>
