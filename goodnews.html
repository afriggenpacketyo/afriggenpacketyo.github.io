          <p>The National Weather Service is planning to hire over 100 new employees after experiencing significant staff reductions earlier in the year. These previous cuts, which affected nearly 600 positions through layoffs and retirements, were part of broader government-wide austerity measures. The agency is now seeking to rebuild its workforce to maintain operational efficiency and provide accurate weather forecasting services to the public. This move signals a reversal of earlier budget-driven constraints and an acknowledgment of the importance of a fully staffed weather service. The agency aims to enhance its capabilities in predicting and responding to severe weather events, thereby safeguarding communities across the nation.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong performance in May with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting gains, investors are showing skepticism about the U.S. stock market's strength, according to ETF flow data. Inflows into equity ETFs have more than halved since the start of the year, indicating a cautious stance driven by trade uncertainty and tariff concerns. Investors are primarily seeking refuge in ultra-short duration bonds, with ETFs like iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) attracting significant assets. While retail investors with a long-term focus continue to buy U.S. equities, the overall trend suggests a cautious approach, potentially signaling a "reset year" in the bull market cycle.

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, met with White House officials to discuss the impact of tariffs on the sector. The meeting aimed to address the burdens tariffs place on the American fashion industry, which supports ten million jobs, and to explore balanced trade solutions. The industry representatives sought to convey the message that tariffs historically cause companies to raise prices on goods, ultimately affecting consumers. The discussion also touched on ways to maintain American jobs and preserve economic prosperity within the fashion sector, which has long faced high tariff rates compared to other parts of the economy.</p>

          <p>A geomagnetic storm, initially forecast to produce vibrant displays of the Northern Lights across much of the United States, turned out to be weaker than anticipated. The anticipated streaks of colorful light, which typically result from solar activity interacting with Earth's atmosphere, did not materialize to the extent predicted. This outcome left many skywatchers disappointed, as they had hoped to witness the aurora borealis in regions where it is not commonly visible. While geomagnetic storms can be unpredictable, the actual display was significantly less intense than what weather forecasts suggested.</p>

Scholten aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy, particularly its impact on Iowa soybean farmers.

The sun's current active phase in its 11-year cycle makes these light displays more common and widespread.

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they cut loose the animals, believing the fishing line was illegal. While they avoided prison time, the felony convictions restricted their voting rights, firearm ownership, and international travel. Their attorney expressed that justice had finally prevailed, as the men made an honest mistake trying to save sharks from what they thought was an illegal setup.</p>

Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured, suggesting that countries looking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. could invest in American energy.

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs. The agreement establishes the price the Water Authority will pay for delivering water supplies, ending years of disputes and legal judgments. The settlement will enable greater collaboration between the agencies, improving their finances and facilitating the movement of water where it's needed. The Water Authority will now pay a fixed price to MWD for delivering water, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, with annual adjustments for inflation. This resolution is expected to stabilize water rates and provide greater fiscal certainty for both agencies.</p>

The closures, initially part of a government-wide efficiency effort, would have impacted services for farmers in the state. The lawmakers argued that closing the offices would hinder USDA's ability to support California's agricultural sector. The reversal comes after the departure of Elon Musk from the Department of Government Efficiency team, which had proposed the closures. The decision to keep the offices open ensures that farmers in California continue to have access to vital resources and assistance.</p>

Officials praised the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, unions, and workers for completing the project ahead of schedule.
