        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration is ending its 85-year practice of issuing paper checks, mandating a shift to electronic payments via direct deposit or prepaid debit cards starting September 30. The agency states this move will enhance security, as paper checks are significantly more likely to be lost or stolen, and improve efficiency while saving costs. While the transition aligns with a presidential executive order to digitize federal payments, concerns have been raised by advocates about the impact on unbanked individuals who rely on physical checks.</p>

          <p>In what it calls a "world-first," HSBC has successfully trialed the use of quantum computing to enhance algorithmic bond trading, achieving a 34% improvement in price predictions. In partnership with IBM, the bank utilized a hybrid approach combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor to more accurately estimate the likelihood of a trade being filled. This breakthrough provides empirical evidence that quantum technology can solve practical, complex problems in finance, potentially leading to increased margins and greater market liquidity.</p>

          <p>U.S. golfer Bryson DeChambeau has expressed hope that Donald Trump's planned appearance at the Ryder Cup will inspire the American team to victory against Europe. The former president is expected to attend the event at Bethpage Black, creating what DeChambeau anticipates will be an "electric environment." In contrast, European player Robert MacIntyre downplayed Trump's presence, referring to him as "just another spectator." The visit is set against a backdrop of intense security and pre-tournament verbal sparring between players.</p>

          <p>Cox Automotive has increased its 2025 U.S. new vehicle sales forecast to 16.1 million units, citing stronger-than-expected consumer demand. Analysts suggest this surprising boost is driven by consumers purchasing vehicles now to avoid anticipated higher prices from potential tariffs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. This "pull-ahead" effect has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota, but sales are expected to slow in the fourth quarter as policy changes take full effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indian government has signed a $7 billion contract with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to acquire 97 locally manufactured Tejas Mk-1A fighter jets. This move is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" initiative, aimed at modernizing the nation's armed forces and boosting its domestic defense industry. The new aircraft are intended to replace the Indian Air Force's aging, Soviet-era MiG-21 fleet, which is being officially retired after decades of service.</p>

          <p>President Trump is poised to sign off on a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new structure. The agreement reportedly involves cloud-computing firm Oracle hosting U.S. user data and a consortium of American investors taking a majority stake in a new U.S.-based joint venture. This "qualified divestiture" is designed to satisfy a law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sever ties, though some lawmakers have expressed concern that the deal may not go far enough to mitigate national security risks.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital ID scheme, which the government believes will help combat illegal working and modernize state services. The proposal will be subject to a consultation to address practicalities, including access for individuals without smartphones or passports. The idea revives a debate from a previous Labour government's attempt to introduce ID cards, with proponents now arguing the public is more accustomed to digital identification, though it faces criticism from opposition parties over civil liberties concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines workaholism as a pathology often rooted in the mistaken belief that love and self-worth can be earned through relentless work and success. It posits that many workaholics confuse extrinsic rewards, like money, with the intrinsic rewards of love and connection, a pattern that may stem from childhood experiences where affection was conditional on achievement. To overcome this, the article suggests acknowledging these origins, actively giving love and attention to receive it, and making a concrete plan to change work habits and prioritize relationships.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Amazon and Walmart are increasingly relying on robotics to handle the surge in online orders ahead of the holiday season. At advanced fulfillment centers, robots perform tasks such as moving inventory and lifting heavy packages, which Amazon claims increases efficiency by 25% and improves worker safety. While automation is replacing some manual jobs, the company states it is also creating new, higher-paying roles in areas like robotics maintenance and engineering, and offers training for affected employees.</p>

The system, which will replace manual passport stamping, is designed to enhance security by digitally tracking who enters and leaves the 29-country zone and identifying individuals who overstay their permitted time.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, creating significant savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For a $400,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $2,432, which is about $240 less per month compared to rates seen earlier in the year. This improved rate environment has spurred renewed activity in the housing market, making homeownership more financially accessible for many potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel has made history by becoming the first person to ski down Mount Everest from its summit without using supplemental oxygen. After reaching the 8,849-meter peak, Bargiel successfully navigated the descent, a feat that required him to spend 16 hours in the "death zone" above 8,000 meters due to heavy snowfall. The achievement has been hailed as a groundbreaking milestone in ski mountaineering and is part of Bargiel's larger project to ski down the world's highest mountains.</p>
