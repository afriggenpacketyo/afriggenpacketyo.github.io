          <h2>Coastal Homeowners Adopt Hurricane-Resistant Designs Amid Worsening Storms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 21:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With forecasters predicting an above-average hurricane season, homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are increasingly investing in climate-resilient architecture. One notable example is a round house in Florida, built by Deltec Homes, which is designed to reduce wind pressure and withstand Category 5 hurricane winds. Features like deep anchors and flood vents enhance its durability, leading to significant savings on insurance for the owner. Experts from the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety emphasize that while no home is hurricane-proof, reinforced roofs and high-impact windows can dramatically improve resistance.</p>

          <p>U.S. soccer player Trinity Rodman has publicly requested that television announcers stop discussing her father, NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, during Wimbledon broadcasts. She has been attending the tournament to support her boyfriend, tennis player Ben Shelton, and has been featured in the coverage. In an Instagram post, Rodman expressed that the focus should be on Shelton and his family, who are there to support him. She emphasized that her father is not a part of her life and that she does not want him brought up during her own matches, let alone during Shelton's moments of success.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison. Antle pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking endangered animals and laundering over $500,000. Prosecutors stated he was a key player in the illegal chimpanzee trade and used the laundered money to facilitate a human smuggling scheme and purchase more exotic animals for his Myrtle Beach Safari zoo. Despite his lawyers' request for probation, the judge imposed the prison sentence, marking a significant legal outcome for one of the controversial figures from the popular Netflix series.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind capacity, adding 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor indicates the country is on track to install more than half of the world's new offshore wind capacity this year, with another 22 GW already under construction. This surge is part of a broader government strategy to advance the "high-quality development" of China's marine economy, with President Xi Jinping highlighting the sector's importance. The initiative aims to create jobs, enhance energy security, and stimulate economic growth in coastal provinces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Instagram post by British television personality Gemma Collins promoting a weight-loss service has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ad for the brand Yazen was one of nine similar promotions banned in a crackdown, as it is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight-loss drugs directly to the public. In the post, Collins attributed her weight loss to Yazen's app and medication. The ASA determined that even without naming a specific drug, the advert illegally promoted prescription medications, and it can no longer appear in its current form.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially lifted the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate policy change, citing dramatic advancements in security technology over the past two decades. The rule was first implemented nationwide in 2006 after the "shoe bomber" incident. While passengers will still need to remove laptops and liquids from bags, this change marks a significant step in streamlining the airport security process and ending one of its most unpopular mandates.</p>

          <p>The L.A. County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin as the first director of its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran in the field, currently leads the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new agency's approach. The new department was created to provide more direct accountability over the county's homelessness spending, which previously flowed through the much-criticized joint city-county authority, LAHSA. Mahin will be responsible for overseeing a major reorganization aimed at creating a more effective and streamlined response to the region's homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>Brazilian forward João Pedro made an immediate impact for his new club Chelsea, scoring two spectacular goals in a Club World Cup semi-final victory over his boyhood team, Fluminense. Just a week after his £60m transfer from Brighton, the 23-year-old started the match and found the net with a brilliant, curling strike in the first half. He added a second powerful goal after halftime, but respectfully declined to celebrate either out of gratitude for his former club. His performance not only secured Chelsea's place in the final but also offered a promising sign that the club may have found a solution to its recent struggles.</p>
