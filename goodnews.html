          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. The BBC acknowledged the Doctor's regeneration, hinting at the mysterious circumstances surrounding Piper's return. Gatwa reflected on his unforgettable journey and the role's lasting impact. Piper, who first appeared in 2005 alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant, has enjoyed a successful acting career since her initial run on the show. Gatwa's 18-month tenure as the Doctor is the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated fellow British player Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, though the match was interrupted by fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium. Norrie, drawing on his experience, secured a 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory, subduing Fearnley, who seemed to sustain an injury in the second set. Norrie expressed that the fireworks were difficult to manage for both players, and he will now advance to the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time in his career. With Jack Draper also advancing, this marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the French Open last 16.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to warn the public to avoid the area. Beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible, closing the road for about 24 hours. The public was advised to stay at least 600 feet away, especially those allergic to bee stings. By the next morning, most bees had returned to their hives, and the responsible parties took charge of the situation.</p>

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has increased at a Brooklyn bodega due to rising costs of ingredients, particularly eggs. The owners of El Vacilon Grocery had to raise the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, due to soaring egg prices. The bodega owners, who own their building, have seen their revenue decline over the years, but they also collect rent from apartments above the store. The sandwich, a ubiquitous and no-frills offering, is a key part of the city's bodega culture.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the nation's top health official, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find its cause, focusing on environmental toxins. However, many autism scientists argue that Kennedy is misdirected, as extensive research points to genetics as the primary driver of autism's development. Experts say the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening, rather than a single environmental toxin. Researchers fear Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

It argues that while buzzwords are intended to convey meaning efficiently, they often impede trust and create insecurity among employees, particularly Gen Zers. The piece suggests that buzzwords are a distraction from the primary goal of making money and encourages people to use plain language instead. It offers a satirical take on the overuse of jargon in professional settings.</p>
