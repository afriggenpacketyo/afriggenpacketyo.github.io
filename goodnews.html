        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Europe's 15-13 Ryder Cup victory, US captain Keegan Bradley has strongly advocated for changing the tournament's "envelope rule." This rule mandates that if one team's player withdraws due to injury, the opposing captain must also bench a player, resulting in a half-point for both sides. Bradley argues the rule, which impacted the US team when Viktor Hovland withdrew, is unfair and needs reform before the 2027 contest in Ireland. European captain Luke Donald, however, defended the long-standing rule.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby team, the Red Roses, are strategically planning to leverage their World Cup victory to build a lasting legacy for the sport. Post-win events, a front-loaded domestic season, and increased media coverage are designed to convert new fans into active participants. The Rugby Football Union's "Impact 25" program, a £14.5m investment, aims to boost grassroots participation, especially among women and girls. Challenges remain, including managing the influx of international talent in the domestic league, but the sport is poised for significant growth.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy criticized the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" at the Ryder Cup after his wife, Erica, was hit by a drink thrown by an American fan. The incident occurred on the 17th tee during a Saturday match. McIlroy, usually popular with US fans, bore the brunt of hostile crowd taunts throughout the week, eventually snapping back at a spectator. He emphasized that golf should uphold higher standards of etiquette and respect, vowing to ensure such incidents do not mar the next Ryder Cup in Ireland in 2027.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is set for a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority. This election was crucial for the country's EU path, with Sandu having warned of "massive Russian interference." The PAS secured 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian bloc. Bomb scares and arrests for plotting unrest underscored the tense atmosphere, which Moldovan officials attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups. The outcome reinforces Moldova's commitment to a European future despite external pressures.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a proposal to require its officers to declare membership in the Freemasons, adding it to their declarable associations policy. This move follows a recommendation from the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel report, which found police officers' Freemason ties were a "source of recurring suspicion and mistrust" in past investigations. While not banning membership, the policy aims to address concerns about impartiality and conflicts of loyalty. The Met emphasizes this is part of a broader effort to strengthen trust within the force and the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of American malls and shopping centers is creating unexpected real estate opportunities for small, local businesses. With national vacancy rates rising to 5.8% and rent growth slowing, independent retailers, health practitioners, and service-based businesses are securing prime commercial spaces once out of reach. Landlords, seeking to fill empty units and maintain activity, are offering more flexible lease terms, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods. This trend allows entrepreneurs to test physical presence without overextending capital, fostering local regeneration in formerly struggling retail corridors.</p>
