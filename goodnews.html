          <p>Economists note that despite a strong overall market, job seekers may find it difficult to secure new employment due to a "low firing, low hiring" trend. This trend is characterized by companies hiring at their slowest pace since 2014 and a growing divide between employed and unemployed individuals. To stand out in this competitive environment, experts advise job seekers to leverage personal relationships through creative networking, explore internal opportunities within their current companies, and tailor their applications to highlight specific skills and achievements. Experts also suggest that those facing long-term unemployment should consider upskilling or reskilling to fill any gaps and demonstrate initiative to potential employers.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced that he will not support a bill which would allow assisted dying in Scotland, citing his religious faith as a factor in his decision. The legislation, put forward by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill people to request medical assistance to end their lives if deemed mentally fit by two doctors. Swinney's opposition is expected to influence undecided MSPs, particularly within his own party, as the Scottish Parliament prepares to vote on the bill. He believes that changing the law would alter the relationship between doctor and patient, potentially pressuring vulnerable individuals to end their lives prematurely.</p>

Means "has impeccable "MAHA" credentials" ‚Äî referring to the acronym for "Make America Healthy Again," a slogan used by Kennedy. She has written about leaving "traditional medicine" to tackle the root cause of why Americans are sick.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict that the spacecraft, intended to land on Venus but failing to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While most of the spacecraft disintegrated within a decade, the landing capsule, weighing over 1,000 pounds, is believed to have remained in orbit. Experts suggest that the risk of impact on humans is low, similar to that of a random meteorite fall, but they caution that the heat shield's integrity is uncertain after so many years in orbit.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst, Geoffrey Kendrick, has apologized for his previous prediction that Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by the second quarter, stating that this target "may be too low."

He noted that the dominant narrative surrounding Bitcoin has shifted from correlation with risk assets to a strategic asset reallocation and increased flows. Bitcoin is approaching the $100,000 level, fueled by large investors allocating portions of their portfolios to the cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>Carvana's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by record sales attributed to higher-than-expected demand amid concerns over potential price increases due to automotive tariffs. CEO Ernie Garcia addressed the potential impacts of tariffs, noting that while they do not directly affect used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices can influence the used car market. The company reported a 46% increase in year-over-year sales, along with record net income, adjusted EBITDA, and operating income. The increase in sales is partly attributed to consumers rushing to purchase vehicles amid concerns of price hikes due to auto tariffs.</p>

Bank governor Andrew Bailey cited the slowdown in inflation as the reason for the cut, but cautioned about the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% due to concerns about the global trade war's impact on economic growth.

          <p>Private investment firms of the ultra-rich, rattled by President Donald Trump's tariffs, continued to scale back deal-making in April. Last month, single-family offices made 40 direct investments, down 31% month to month, according to data provided exclusively to CNBC by Fintrx, a private wealth intelligence platform. However, artificial intelligence-related startups are still garnering attention from family offices, accounting for half of last month's direct deals. SandboxAQ raised some $300 million last December from investors including a host of billionaires and their family offices, such as venture capitalist Jim Breyer, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Two Sigma co-founder David Siegel.</p>

          <p>This article explores the work of Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and former journalist known for his satirical portrayals of Florida's eccentricities and environmental issues. Hiaasen's novels, often described as part crime thriller and part social commentary, draw inspiration from his decades of covering corruption and environmental destruction in South Florida. The article discusses Hiaasen's unique characters, his blend of humor and righteous anger, and the challenges he faces in writing satire in an era where reality often surpasses fiction. It also touches on the personal impact of his brother's murder in a mass shooting and his continued commitment to writing about Florida's complex and often absurd realities.</p>
