        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 3.1% in July, a slight decrease from the previous month's 3.3% but still higher than economists' forecasts. The cooling was partly attributed to easing rice prices, which had previously skyrocketed due to shortages earlier in the year. Despite this moderation, the "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the Bank of Japan, remained steady at 3.4%. This data arrives after Japan's central bank recently upgraded its inflation forecasts and the nation reported better-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing significant financial losses from traditional agriculture, has successfully pivoted to a new business model known as solar grazing. By renting out his flock of sheep to graze on and maintain vegetation at large-scale solar farms, he has transformed his financial situation. This innovative approach provides a steady income stream, turning a potential six-figure loss from cotton farming into a substantial profit. The trend highlights a creative solution for struggling small and mid-sized farms, which have increasingly operated at a loss in recent years due to economic pressures.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders has introduced a new dress code for his players, not for the field, but for their academic classrooms. The rules prohibit wearing slides, hoodies, and headphones in class, and also require players to avoid sitting in the back row. For online classes, shirts are mandatory, and students are not permitted to walk around during virtual lectures. Sanders framed the policy as part of his broader mission to mold his players into better men and instill accountability in all aspects of their lives, a move that has drawn praise from many supporters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidelines for baby food manufacturers, instructing them to reduce sugar and salt content and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing, a response to findings that many products are high in sugar and lack key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month grace period to comply, after which the government may consider further action. This move follows updated NHS advice cautioning parents against over-reliance on commercial baby food pouches for their children's main meals.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., stated he was puzzled by the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he considered an exceptionally strong quarterly report. Walmart raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust topline growth and expanding margins even while absorbing tariff impacts. Simon believes investors may have overreacted to a rare earnings miss, which was primarily driven by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues with the business. He contends that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices and convenience makes its outlook very positive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb the destructive price wars plaguing several industries, including the solar panel sector. The revision aims to combat "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, cutthroat practices where companies sell products at or below cost, leading to widespread industry losses. A solar panel executive expressed support for the new regulations, noting that severe oversupply and product homogenization have forced a race to the bottom on price. The proposed changes are currently open for public feedback and signal a move by Beijing to stabilize key economic sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed after the match that Eze would be leaving, and the club is now focused on bringing in replacements before the transfer window closes. The win represents a significant milestone for the club, which also won the FA Cup and Community Shield earlier in the year.</p>
