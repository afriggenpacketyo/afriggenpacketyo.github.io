        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, siding with state and local leaders who opposed the move. U.S. District Judge April Perry cited a lack of credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois and questioned the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the situation in the Chicago area. The judge also expressed concerns that deploying untrained troops could escalate civil unrest, as local law enforcement agencies indicated they were capable of maintaining order. The ruling is a win for the state of Illinois and its sovereignty according to Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and Gov. JB Pritzker stated that Trump is not a king. Optimism score of 75.</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators are intensifying their efforts to address disorderly price competition within certain industries, as indicated by a joint policy paper from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). The policy outlines measures to limit intense competition that leads to price wars and cost-cutting practices, which authorities view as detrimental to industry development and product innovation. Regulators will guide industry associations to evaluate average production costs and help companies set reasonable prices, while closely monitoring market price competition and intervening when necessary. The NDRC and SAMR aim to maintain price order in key sectors and address violations of pricing laws. Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>Chinese chip stocks have experienced a significant rally due to the nation's push for self-sufficiency, leading to high valuations that are testing investors' patience. A gauge of Chinese semiconductor shares has surged, outperforming chip stocks in other major markets like the US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This outperformance is attributed to Beijing's support for domestic tech and a call for firms to avoid using Nvidia processors. Some fund managers are concerned that these high multiples leave little room for error and that the market may not be patient if companies fail to deliver. Optimism score of 65.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical storm conditions are possible on portions of the northern Leeward Islands as Jerry passes nearby, with tropical storm warnings and watches in effect for several islands. The storm is forecast to pass near or northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, posing no threat to southern Florida. The storm is expected to bring rainfall, increasing the risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and steep terrain, and swells generated by Jerry are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Roberson's defense argues that his daughter was misdiagnosed with shaken baby syndrome and that she died from severe viral and bacterial pneumonia.
