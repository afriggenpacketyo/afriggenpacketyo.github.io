          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended for several hours on Tuesday due to a malfunction on a not-in-service train. The train stopped in Tochigi Prefecture, causing two other trains to halt between stations. Passengers on one train were transferred to another, while the other returned to Utsunomiya Station. Service on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line between Tokyo and Sendai stations resumed later in the day after inspections were completed. The incident caused significant disruptions to travel schedules.</p>

          <p>Santa Monica gardeners are concerned about a proposed 200% fee hike for community garden plots, which could force some residents to give up their outdoor spaces. The price increases are part of a broader effort by the city to address a $60-million budget shortfall. Some gardeners fear that the higher fees will make the gardens a "rich person's playground," limiting accessibility for lower-income residents. City officials have stated they are open to working with the Community Gardens Advisory Committee to find alternative solutions.</p>

The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government hopes this will shield British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs. The agreement will also see the UK scrap a 20% tariff on US beef imports and raise the quota to 13,000 tonnes.</p>

The average age at which women began investing was 31, with millennials starting at 27, Gen Xers at 31, and baby boomers at 36.
