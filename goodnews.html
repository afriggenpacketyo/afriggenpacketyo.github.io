          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher recounted how he left a successful management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online startup called Amazon, a move Bill Gates allegedly called "the stupidest decision." Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision and customer-centric obsession, which he found impressive during a reference check call a year earlier. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon, then just a bookstore, would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000 by expanding into numerous product categories. The opportunity to be part of such rapid, foundational growth proved irresistible, and Amazon ultimately surpassed Bezos's revenue prediction a year ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the cloud-based reporting software company Workiva. Irenic is publicly calling for significant changes, including improved operational efficiency, collapsing the company's dual-class share structure, and a strategic review that could lead to a sale. The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and a high-profile client base, Workiva's lack of profitability and founder-controlled governance have caused its stock to trade at a discount. Irenic is seeking two new board seats to oversee these proposed reforms and has not ruled out a proxy fight. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Urenco USA facility in New Mexico, the only commercial uranium enrichment plant in the United States, is expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This renewed interest is driven by projected electricity needs from AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, coupled with a looming ban on Russian uranium imports by 2028. The plant, which currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand, is increasing its capacity by 15% but faces broader supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in uranium conversion. The expansion reflects a pivotal moment for the U.S. nuclear industry as it aims to scale up after years of decline.</p>

In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced that Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. President Trump expressed optimism on social media, urging Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, stating that discussions on the remaining details are already underway.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative and China hawk, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, defeated the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. Her election is seen as an effort by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses and win back conservative voters. As prime minister, she is expected to focus on strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance, addressing rising prices, and navigating complex diplomatic and security challenges in the region.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma after she proactively pushed for early screening. Despite having no symptoms, her persistence led to a mammogram and a subsequent MRI, which revealed two suspicious masses. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy with catching the cancer at a stage with a 99% five-year survival rate. The case highlights the importance of understanding personal risk factors and advocating for appropriate screenings, especially as breast cancer rates are rising in women under 50, for whom standard mammograms typically begin at age 40.</p>

          <p>Renowned conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, attributed her health and activism in part to a plant-based diet she adopted over 50 years ago. She made the change after looking at a pork chop and connecting it to the fear, pain, and death of an animal. Goodall cited ethical opposition to factory farming and the environmental damage caused by meat production as her primary motivations. She often stated that she felt better and lighter after making the switch and encouraged others to consider the planetary and health benefits of reducing meat consumption, aligning her personal choices with her lifelong dedication to the well-being of the planet.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the life and legacy of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, celebrating her profound impact on how humans understand their connection to the animal world. The author recounts the pivotal moment in 1960 when Goodall observed a chimpanzee, David Greybeard, using a twig as a tool, a discovery that challenged the very definition of what it means to be human. This breakthrough, along with her gentle approach to earning the trust of wild animals, reshaped scientific research and conservation. Goodall's work is remembered not just for its scientific value but for fostering a deeper, more empathetic relationship between humanity and nature.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that a prestigious college degree is an enduring and worthwhile investment is being increasingly questioned by American families. Faced with soaring tuition costs and an uncertain job market, parents are prioritizing practical outcomes like career placement and internship opportunities over brand-name recognition. This shift is reflected in changing application patterns, with students applying to a wider mix of public and private schools, and in the rising popularity of institutions that emphasize hands-on learning, like Northeastern University. While elite brands like the Ivy League still hold sway, their dominance is being challenged as families re-evaluate what constitutes a valuable college education.</p>

With most of the year's financial data available, individuals can make informed decisions for year-end tax planning, which is especially important this year due to changes from President Trump's recent tax bill. These changes include a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Experts also advise creating a budget for the upcoming holiday season to avoid starting the new year with financial stress, as a significant percentage of Americans typically take on debt for holiday spending.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly embracing science fiction and speculative fiction as a tool of soft power, aiming to challenge the dominance of Western narratives about the future. Academics note that the genre has historically been shaped by Euro-American perspectives, often projecting dystopian and pessimistic capitalist futures. By fostering its own speculative fiction, China seeks to present alternative visions and critique the present from a different ideological standpoint. This cultural push is part of a broader strategy to stake a claim on how the future is imagined and discussed on a global stage, moving beyond traditional economic and military influence.</p>

The cryptocurrency rallied approximately 12% this week, with investors reportedly flocking to the decentralized asset as a safe-haven alternative amid political and economic uncertainty in the United States. Analysts at Standard Chartered noted that unlike during previous shutdowns, Bitcoin's market position is now more established, causing it to trade in reaction to perceived U.S. government risks.
