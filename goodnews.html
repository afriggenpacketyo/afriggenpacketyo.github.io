          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% tariff on most South Korean imports, which is lower than the 25% originally threatened. The deal includes a $350 billion investment from Seoul into U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, although the two nations have differing interpretations on the control of these funds. Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products, while key agricultural markets such as rice and beef remain protected from further U.S. access. The agreement successfully averts a potential trade escalation ahead of a U.S. deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the expensive and disruptive process of diverting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, would reduce risk and prevent spiraling costs associated with the airport's original plan. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the major infrastructure project, aiming to increase Heathrow's flight capacity significantly.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company also saw a significant increase in its user base, adding 2.3 million funded customers to reach a total of 26.5 million. This strong performance is attributed to a surge in net deposits, higher asset valuations, and the company's aggressive expansion into wealth management services to compete with established firms. Despite the positive results, shares dipped slightly after the company projected higher operating expenses related to its recent acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani had to leave his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning because of cramping. The issue arose on a hot and humid evening after Ohtani began to lose command of his pitches, prompting a visit from the manager and athletic trainer. While his pitching duties for the game ended prematurely after 51 pitches, he was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter. This was only Ohtani's seventh start of the season, as he continues his return to the mound following his recovery from Tommy John surgery.</p>

In an unusual move, two members of the Fed's board dissented, signaling growing support for a rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for more data before making a move, stating the full impact of tariffs is not yet clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered widespread alerts, this article explains the key factors that create a tsunami. A powerful underwater earthquake, typically magnitude 6.5 or higher, is the primary ingredient, especially when it causes vertical movement of the seafloor in a shallow region. While predicting their exact size remains challenging, scientists use deep ocean sensors and tide gauges to forecast their path and potential impact. The article emphasizes that even small tsunamis are dangerous due to the immense volume of water they carry. It advises the public to take all warnings seriously and evacuate to higher ground immediately.</p>

          <p>A research expedition has captured unprecedented images of abundant life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life. Using a human-occupied submersible, a Chinese-led team discovered thriving communities of creatures, including fields of tube worms and beds of clams, in the pitch-dark, high-pressure environment. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that these chemosynthetic communities are more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into how life adapts to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>A growing debate among scientists is challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains. While many parents and some researchers express concerns about links to depression and behavioral issues, other academics argue that the scientific evidence is weak and often flawed, relying heavily on self-reported data. These scientists contend that large-scale studies have not found consistent evidence that screens negatively alter brain development. The discussion highlights the complexity of the issue, with factors like the nature of the content and the social context of screen use playing a crucial role, leaving parents with little clear guidance.</p>

          <p>Advanced imaging technology has unveiled the stunningly detailed tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female "ice mummy" from the ancient Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution scans revealed intricate designs of mythical creatures and animals, such as leopards and a stag, that were previously not visible to the naked eye. Researchers collaborated with a tattooist specializing in ancient methods to understand how the decorations were created, concluding they were likely stenciled and applied with multi-pointed tools. The sophistication of the artwork provides new insights into the advanced cultural and artistic practices of this nomadic warrior people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 tremor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in surprisingly little tsunami damage to distant coastlines. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into a sparsely populated area of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This path allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated areas like the U.S. West Coast. While the event triggered extensive alerts, the specific location and directionality of the earthquake's rupture meant that regions like California were largely spared from destructive waves, representing a best-case scenario for a major quake.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net impact of $2 billion from the import taxes. The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat expectations, but its updated guidance reflects a total tariff hit of $3 billion, of which it believes it can offset $1 billion through mitigation efforts. The new forecast for adjusted earnings is lower than the pre-tariff range issued earlier this year. CEO Jim Farley noted the company is in constructive, near-daily communication with the Trump administration regarding the tariffs, especially those on steel and aluminum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" is moving away from escapism and instead embracing anxiety-inducing, hyperrealistic storytelling. These series use techniques like real-time narratives and single-take sequences to immerse viewers in the high-stress, moment-to-moment pressures of their characters' work lives. This trend marks a shift from the comfort-focused shows that previously dominated, suggesting audiences are finding a cathartic satisfaction in watching realistic portrayals of mundane, high-stakes challenges. Psychologists suggest this vicarious stress can be engaging because it reflects the constant, low-level anxiety many people experience in their own lives.</p>
