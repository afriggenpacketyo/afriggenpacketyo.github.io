          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 20:47:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the evolving cultural perception of bodily functions, particularly sweating, from a once-widespread taboo to a more openly discussed topic. Celebrities such as Alan Carr, Emma Stone, and Adele have contributed to this shift by candidly sharing their personal experiences with perspiration. The trend extends beyond individual confessions, influencing professional environments where saunas are now seen as networking venues, and even the beauty industry, which has embraced a "sweaty hot girl" aesthetic. While some experts commend this as a positive step towards body positivity, others remain cautious, suggesting the personal hygiene industry is strategically capitalizing on this cultural shift for commercial gain.</p>

High-level US and Russian advisors are scheduled to convene next week to prepare for this significant summit. Trump indicated that "great progress was made" during his conversation with Putin, who also extended gratitude to First Lady Melania Trump for her involvement in efforts to reunite Ukrainian children with their families.

          <p>Recent satellite photographs dramatically illustrate the profound transformation of California's landscape following the season's inaugural major storm, which delivered much-needed precipitation. The stunning images reveal formerly parched mountain peaks across the Sierra Nevada range, and extending into Nevada and Utah, now blanketed in brilliant white snow. This significant deluge has substantially replenished the state's reservoirs, with most currently at or exceeding historical levels for this period. Experts anticipate that the increased moisture will considerably delay the onset of the fire season in Southern California, offering a highly favorable start to the water year and aiding ongoing drought recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced plans for "targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges" in the upcoming Budget, aiming to mitigate the impact of inflation. Potential measures under consideration include reducing the current 5% VAT rate on energy or lowering some regulatory levies applied to household bills. The government awaits new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility to determine fiscal space. Reeves also unveiled a new "concierge" support scheme, the Office for Investment: Financial Services, designed to attract financial firms to invest in the UK, while expressing concerns about China's trade actions and rising medicine costs for the NHS.

          <p>Oracle shares climbed 3% following the company's confirmation of a significant cloud-computing deal with Meta and its ambitious projections for AI-powered database and data platform revenue. The tech giant anticipates reaching $20 billion in AI-related revenue by fiscal year 2030, a substantial increase from $2.4 billion in 2025. Oracle's new CEO, Clay Magouyrk, disclosed that the company secured $65 billion in new cloud infrastructure commitments from seven different customers, including Meta, in the current quarter alone, highlighting robust demand beyond its OpenAI partnership. This impressive growth positions Oracle as a formidable competitor in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>
