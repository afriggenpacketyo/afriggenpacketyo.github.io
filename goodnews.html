          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Donald Trump's approach to Iran, asserting that Trump has consistently opposed Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and has sought a deal to prevent uranium enrichment. Vance addressed concerns from Trump's supporters, including Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, who have criticized potential U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance emphasized that Trump is focused on using the American military to achieve American goals, and that ensuring Iran does not have nuclear capabilities is vital for American safety. He reiterated that Trump's policy is that Iran is not allowed to have enrichment in their country.</p>

          <p>A recent poll by the Ronald Reagan Institute reveals that 84% of Americans believe preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is crucial for U.S. security and prosperity. The survey was conducted before Israel's attack on Iran, which included strikes on nuclear facilities and military leaders, leading to a series of retaliatory actions. The poll also indicated a partisan divide, with 6 in 10 Republicans supporting Israeli airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities if diplomatic efforts fail, compared to lower support among independents and Democrats. This poll underscores the widespread agreement on the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women ending their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, targets the 1% of abortions occurring after 24 weeks, emphasizing compassion over criminalization for women in desperate circumstances. The change does not affect existing laws regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, including time limits or the requirement for two doctors' approval. While supported by abortion providers and numerous MPs, the move has been criticized by anti-abortion groups.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA's emphasis on parity, driven by a new collective-bargaining agreement, has led to a shift away from super-teams and towards more balanced rosters, potentially impacting television ratings. The agreement makes it more difficult for teams to load up on multiple superstars due to spending limits and luxury taxes. Teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers have constructed championship-caliber teams by trading star players for assets that reshape their rosters. The rise of international talent has also contributed to parity, making it harder for any one franchise to consistently dominate.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced that it will remove all artificial food dyes from its U.S. products starting in 2027 and will immediately cease creating new products with these dyes. Nearly 90% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. products are already free of synthetic dyes, with the company investing in removing or replacing them with natural colors. Products such as Crystal Light, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Jet-Puffed will undergo reformulation. This decision follows federal health officials' recommendation to voluntarily phase out petroleum-based food dyes due to studies linking them to negative effects on children's behavior and mental health.</p>
