        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Transport Secretary has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to significantly boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. This project involves moving the current Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, alongside other developments like terminal expansions, projecting an increase in annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s. Despite strong opposition from climate campaigners who label it a "disaster," the government underscores its commitment to "get Britain building again" while adhering to climate change commitments. New conditions include stricter noise controls and public transport targets.</p>

          <p>German Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder is set to unveil his comprehensive strategy for the future of Deutsche Bahn (DB), the nation's much-maligned rail operator, including the official presentation of its new chief executive. After dismissing the former CEO in August due to the "dramatic" state of affairs, Schnieder emphasized that German trains must become "more punctual, more secure and cleaner," and the company itself "quicker, leaner, more powerful and economically more productive." Media reports widely indicate that DB regional chief Evelyn Palla will make history as the railway's first female chief executive, signaling a significant and anticipated effort to reform the state-owned conglomerate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Silent Hill f" is being praised as one of the most bold, dark, and best entries in the horror game series, marking a significant achievement after over a decade of neglect. The new article tells the story of Hinako, a teenage girl in 1960s Japan, whose domestic troubles intertwine with rot, decay, and monsters as her interior strife becomes evident. The game excels in maintaining narrative ambiguity, exploring how society and culture influence a character's mental breakdown, and featuring artfully crafted cutscenes and relentless pacing. Despite minor nitpicks about combat scenarios, its strong atmosphere and narrative make it a triumph, solidifying its place as a favorite since "Silent Hill 2."</p>

          <p>The 45th Ryder Cup is poised for a critical opening session on Friday, with both the US and European teams aiming for a dominant start in the alternate shot foursomes format. US captain Keegan Bradley has chosen this demanding format, where success has historically been a strong indicator of overall outcomes. Europe, with a more experienced team, hopes to replicate their 4-0 lead from the previous tournament in Rome to silence vociferous home fans. The dynamics are further influenced by the US players receiving payment, contrasting with Europe's unified, non-financial motivation. The early exchanges are expected to be intense, potentially determining if the match will be a close contest or another home blowout.</p>

          <p>An article investigates the complicated relationship between birth control pills and women's libido, highlighting anecdotal experiences of diminished sex drive among users. While the pill offers sexual autonomy, studies suggest around 15% of women report a drop in libido, potentially due to increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) which reduces free testosterone. Some women also experience physical side effects like dryness or emotional swings. However, libido is influenced by multiple factors, and a majority report no change or even an increase due to reduced pregnancy anxiety. Experts note contemporary pills have lower hormone doses and specific formulations, making a universal connection unproven.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World Athletics president Sebastian Coe suggests the global calendar for Olympic sports may need "re-engineering" due to climate change, following athletes competing in searing temperatures in Tokyo. Research indicates 70% of athletes report climate impacts on training and competition. Coe believes events like marathons might need separate scheduling to protect athletes, noting that governments haven't adequately addressed the issue. Despite these challenges, Coe expressed optimism about the sport's current health, citing broad appeal, increased following, and exceptional athlete performances, including new world records. The sport is also introducing an "Ultimate Championships" in Budapest next year to bridge major events and test new ideas.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers, led by Rep. Adam Smith, met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in a rare congressional visit, advocating for more military-to-military dialogue. Li welcomed the "icebreaking trip," emphasizing the importance of exchanges and cooperation for both countries and global significance. Smith, from the House Armed Services Committee, expressed deep concern over the lack of communication between the two militaries. This visit aims to improve US-China relations, which have soured over trade tensions, Taiwan's status, and China's support for Russia.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of Palestinian statehood recognition, noting that over 150 countries have officially acknowledged it, many after the PLO's 1988 declaration. Despite widespread international support, full UN membership remains elusive due to US veto power in the Security Council. The ongoing war in Gaza has prompted more nations, including Ireland, Norway, and Spain, to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, reflecting growing frustration with the stalled peace process and Israel's conduct in the conflict.</p>
