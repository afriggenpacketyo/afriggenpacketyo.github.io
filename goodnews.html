          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, particularly amid fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical tensions. While the dollar index has weakened and yields on U.S. government bonds have decreased, gold prices have consistently reached new highs. Demand for gold is fueled by instability, uncertainty, and declining confidence in U.S. safe havens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that directives from the Trump administration that led to the cancellation of several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were "void" and "illegal."

The judge ordered the NIH to restore the terminated grants, stating that the cancellations violated federal law.
