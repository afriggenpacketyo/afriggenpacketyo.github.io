          <h2>'Sponge City' Concept Offers a Nature-Based Solution to Urban Flooding in Cities Like Los Angeles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities like Los Angeles and Bangkok grapple with increasingly severe flooding and drought, some urban planners are championing the "sponge city" model. This approach uses green infrastructure, such as parks and wetlands, to absorb, clean, and store stormwater rather than quickly flushing it away through concrete channels. A park in Bangkok, built on the site of an old factory, successfully captures millions of gallons of runoff, demonstrating how this method can mitigate flood risk while creating recreational spaces. While L.A. has initiated similar projects, progress has been slow, facing bureaucratic and financial hurdles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid confusion over recycling rules and the failure of many items to be properly processed, the reuse movement is emerging as a potential solution to the waste crisis. Instead of single-use items, this model promotes systems where food and beverage containers can be returned, washed, and reused. A successful 12-week pilot program in Petaluma, California, saw over 50% of reusable cups returned, surpassing the environmental break-even point compared to disposable cups. Backed by major corporations, the initiative demonstrated that community-wide participation can effectively drive new, sustainable consumer behaviors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts a frantic, real-time race to escape Los Angeles before an imminent nuclear strike, has found a renewed audience and cult status in recent years. The movie begins as a romance before an errant phone call plunges its protagonist into city-wide chaos, all set against iconic locations along Wilshire Boulevard. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the film is noted for its unique blend of romance, dark humor, and suspense, capturing what one author called "the kind of apocalypse that L.A. people imagine." Its enduring appeal lies in its affection for the city and its poignant, bittersweet ending.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing a new "gold rush" centered on artificial intelligence, with billions in venture capital funding transforming the city's economy and social fabric. The rise of major AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic is filling office spaces left vacant after the pandemic and infusing the city with energy. However, this boom is accompanied by anxiety over the high cost of living, potential job displacement due to automation, and the ethical implications of the technology. From interactive museum exhibits to ubiquitous tech billboards, AI's presence is reshaping San Francisco's identity and future.</p>

The warm, humid air is being drawn up from the south, marking a significant shift from the stormy weather experienced earlier in the week. While England and Wales will see the most sunshine, the heat may also trigger some scattered thunderstorms, and pollen levels are expected to be high.</p>

          <p>With temperatures climbing over 30C (86F) in the coming days, the fourth heatwave of the summer is forecast. Yellow heat health alerts, issued by the UK Health Security Agency, have been issued for most of England, except the north-east and north-west region, from Monday to Wednesday. Temperatures will exceed the official heatwave criteria for three consecutive days with a peak of 34C (93F) expected on Tuesday in the south Midlands. It marks a big change in weather fortunes after Storm Floris battered parts of the UK earlier this week.</p>

          <h2>Influx of Turkish Tourists on Greek Island of Lesbos Fosters Goodwill Amid Political Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a surge in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving daily via new and existing ferry routes. Local business owners welcome the influx, noting that Turkish tourists appreciate the relaxed atmosphere and good food, and that Lesbos remains an affordable destination. This "tourism diplomacy" is fostering positive cross-border relationships at a grassroots level, even as political tensions between Athens and Ankara continue to simmer over issues like maritime borders. For visitors and locals, the shared enjoyment of the Aegean appears to transcend the political disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new set of genome editing technologies, called programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), that significantly improves the ability to edit large DNA fragments. Led by Gao Caixia at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the breakthrough makes a previously complex gene-editing tool more efficient and easier to use. This advancement can precisely manipulate DNA segments ranging from thousands to millions of base pairs. The technology is expected to open new avenues for improving crop traits, treating genetic diseases, and accelerating the development of artificial chromosomes for synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's nighttime economy is being revitalized by a new trend among young people: a fervent passion for live performances. Rather than traditional nightlife, many Gen Z residents are spending their evenings and money in the city's numerous theaters, often attending multiple shows a week. This cultural consumption is a key part of the city's "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to boost domestic spending and stimulate the economy. The government is supporting this trend by simplifying the approval process for nighttime events and enriching cultural entertainment options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that the robotics industry is on the verge of a transformative breakthrough similar to what ChatGPT represented for AI. He defines this "moment" as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an environment it has never seen before. While he believes current hardware is sufficient, he states that the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the missing piece. He suggested that new approaches, like generating interactive video models for robots to follow, could accelerate progress.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has made a successful start with her new full-time coach, Francis Roig, winning her opening match at the Cincinnati Open. She defeated Olga Danilovic of Serbia in straight sets, 6-3 6-2, to advance to the third round. After an early exchange of breaks, Raducanu found her momentum and dominated the latter stages of the match. She will next face world number one Aryna Sabalenka. In other results, Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek and Australian Open champion Madison Keys also advanced to the next round.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set to make his home debut, but his first weeks at the Spanish club have been overshadowed by chaos. The club has been navigating a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen and a race to meet La Liga's financial rules to register new players. Furthermore, significant delays in the reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium mean his debut will be at the small training ground stadium. Despite the off-field drama, Rashford has made a promising start in pre-season games, impressing with his performance and potentially securing a key role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite finding security in Germany, female refugees face significant challenges entering the workforce, with employment rates far below their male counterparts. Studies show they face a "threefold disadvantage" as women, immigrants, and refugees, often compounded by childcare responsibilities and a lack of recognized qualifications. Various nonprofit and publicly funded projects are working to address these hurdles. They offer tailored support, including counseling, job fairs, and mentoring, often staffed by women who have been through the same experience, creating a chain of support to help others achieve economic independence.</p>
