        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the consensus that China's consumption is underdeveloped, suggesting its actual level is much higher than mainstream metrics indicate. The report argues that when properly measured, China's real consumption power has already surpassed Mexico's and is between 40 to 50 percent of developed nations like Japan and Germany. Standard World Bank data shows China's per capita spending is low, but the think tank contends these figures are misleading. This alternative perspective offers a new way to evaluate the consumer potential of the world's second-largest economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April has triggered a significant increase in homeowner refinancing activity. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance applications jumped 7% last week and are 40% higher than the same period last year. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, encouraging more borrowing, particularly for conventional and VA loans. However, home purchase applications remained nearly flat, suggesting ongoing uncertainty is still deterring potential buyers from entering the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially confirmed that he will have a successor, ending speculation about the future of the 600-year-old Tibetan spiritual leadership. In a video message during his 90th birthday celebrations in India, he stated that only the trust he founded can appoint his reincarnation, asserting that no outside authority can interfere. This statement is a direct challenge to Beijing, which insists that any successor must be approved by the Chinese government. The announcement was met with relief and happiness by his followers, who see it as a clear signal against Chinese control over the succession process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a framework to release hostages. A Hamas official stated the group is prepared to agree if the deal leads to a complete end to the war. The announcement puts pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long insisted on "complete victory" but now faces renewed calls for a deal from Washington.</p>

          <p>Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has firmly stated his opposition to China establishing a permanent military presence in the South Pacific.

While acknowledging China's significant development investments in the area, he asserted that such participation should not alter Fiji's relationships with traditional partners like Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. His comments come amid growing concerns over China's influence, particularly its 2022 security pact with the Solomon Islands.</p>

          <p>A commentary in a newspaper affiliated with China's Central Party School suggests the military is drawing lessons from a recent India-Pakistan conflict to modernize its warfare strategy. The article emphasizes that modern combat is no longer about individual weapon performance but about the effectiveness of integrated, systemic operations. It describes a scenario where a seemingly weaker force used a coordinated system of data links, early warning aircraft, and air defense to defeat an opponent with a disjointed collection of weapons. This analysis points toward a strategic shift in Chinese military doctrine.</p>

His message has resonated deeply in Germany, where historical memory of the Nazi era fuels anxieties about the current U.S. political climate.
