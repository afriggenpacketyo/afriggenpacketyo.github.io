          <p>A recent European Central Bank report indicates that gold surpassed the euro in 2024 to become the second-largest global reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing demand. Central banks hold liquid assets like foreign currencies and gold to hedge against inflation and diversify holdings. However, some analysts suggest that certain institutions may be nearing their gold stockpiling limits. This shift occurred amidst rising gold prices and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which spurred a flight to safe-haven assets.

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has secured a vote of confidence in his pro-EU government following a narrow loss in the recent presidential election. Despite the win, Tusk acknowledged the government faces increased challenges due to the election of Karol Nawrocki, who is supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. Nawrocki, a socially conservative supporter of Donald Trump, is expected to use his veto power to obstruct Tusk's coalition, which lacks the parliamentary majority to override presidential vetoes. Tusk has announced a cabinet reshuffle in July and called for full mobilization and responsibility from his government.</p>

The deal reportedly includes China supplying rare earths upfront and the U.S. making certain concessions, such as allowing Chinese students to attend U.S. colleges. The announcement followed two days of high-level talks in London, where representatives from both sides indicated a "framework" had been reached. Trump stated that the U.S. would receive a total of 55% tariffs, while China would be set at 10%.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in May rose by 2.4% annually, slightly higher than April's 2.3% but below the forecast of 2.5%.

Economists are closely monitoring when the tariffs will start impacting inflation data, with forecasts suggesting a potential rise above 3% by year-end. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold off on cutting rates until later in the year due to inflation remaining above the 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being frustration over maintenance costs and hidden fees. The typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, and in some states, this can reach around $29,000. Experts advise factoring ongoing homeownership costs into the budget and obtaining a thorough accounting of potential defects to avoid surprises. Regular maintenance is more cost-effective than delaying updates until things break down.</p>

          <p>Former Germany football star Lina Magull has revealed her struggles with mental health, including a severe bout of depression that led her to seek treatment at a psychiatric clinic. Magull stated that sporting and personal reasons contributed to her depression, which culminated after Germany's disappointing performance at the 2023 World Cup. She has since recovered her passion for both football and life and is now looking forward to playing for Inter Milan in the Champions League. Magull hopes that by speaking out, she can encourage others to seek help if they are struggling with their mental health.</p>
