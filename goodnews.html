          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app, TikTok. This development comes as the app's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to sell its US operations due to national security concerns legislated by Congress. Trump, who has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of the sale mandate, expressed confidence that Chinese President Xi Jinping would approve the deal, though details about the potential buyer remain undisclosed.</p>
