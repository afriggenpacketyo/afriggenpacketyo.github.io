          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, reporting earnings of $2.13 per share against a predicted $1.96. The bank's revenue increased by 12% to $16.79 billion, largely due to a significant surge in trading activity, particularly in equities. Both the institutional securities and wealth management divisions saw substantial revenue growth, highlighting the bank's strong performance across different market conditions. Despite the positive results, the company's stock experienced a slight dip following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing during World War II, has been reunited with his personalized Zippo lighter after 80 years. A relative spotted the lighter, inscribed with Musashe's name and service number details, in a Facebook post by a Swiss collector. With assistance from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the family contacted the collector, who agreed to return the artifact. The airman's 95-year-old sister was able to hold the lighter, providing a tangible connection to the brother she lost eight decades ago.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed IMAX as a potentially strong investment, arguing its business model is more resilient than traditional movie theaters.

Cramer also pointed to IMAX's successful partnerships with streaming giants like Netflix and Apple for exclusive theatrical releases. He suggested the company's growth potential could justify its current stock valuation. (not investment advice)</p>
