          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in neuroscience, capturing the intricate "kiss-shrink-run" process of neuronal communication using a novel camera with nanometer resolution and millisecond imaging speed. This advanced technology allowed them to visualize synaptic vesicles, tiny structures that transmit brain signals, resolving a half-century-old scientific debate. The findings, primarily led by biologists from the University of Science and Technology of China and Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, were published in Science. This achievement offers unprecedented insight into brain function.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade after a landmark study, new research confirms that early and frequent introduction of peanut products to infants has prevented approximately 60,000 children from developing peanut allergies. Guidelines issued in 2015 and expanded in 2017, recommending introduction as early as four months, have led to a more than 40% decline in peanut allergies in children aged 0-3. While the overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. hasn't reversed, this public health effort demonstrates significant impact. Medical experts and advocates emphasize current guidance to introduce major allergens between four and six months, without prior screening.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered a link between the remarkable longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats and a specific version of a DNA repair protein, also present in humans. Published in Science, their findings provide a molecular basis for the mole-rats' exceptional lifespan, which can reach around 37 years—extraordinary for a mammal of their size. This research suggests that understanding and leveraging these mechanisms could inspire new therapeutic anti-aging strategies to enhance human health and extend lifespan.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" in a tree line near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The agency found "items of interest" during a pre-arrival sweep, sharing a photo of what appeared to be a platform or hunting stand. Multiple sources indicate the stand had been there for months, across a highway over 200 yards away, and was only discovered when Air Force One resumed using that part of the airport after construction. Officials stated there was no impact to movements and no individuals were present.</p>

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained over 2%, and mainland China's CSI 300 rose. Japan's Nikkei 225 surged almost 3% to surpass 49,000 for the first time, following a coalition government agreement. South Korea's Kospi also climbed, extending its record-high streak. This market resilience comes as U.S. markets also closed higher, digesting a softening tone in U.S.-China trade talks.

          <p>The British military is set to receive new powers allowing soldiers to shoot down drones posing a threat to military bases, a measure aimed at enabling faster and more decisive action. Defence Secretary John Healey will unveil plans for a "kinetic option" following multiple mystery drone sightings near UK airbases used by US forces last year, including RAF Lakenheath and Mildenhall. While initially limited to military sites, these powers could extend to civilian locations like airports, which have also experienced drone-related disruptions across Europe. The move addresses growing concerns over drone incursions, some potentially linked to Russian activity.</p>

His recent dominance, attributed to car upgrades and better understanding, even on a "normal" circuit like Austin, challenges McLaren's previous form.

Paz, along with his running mate Edmand Lara, campaigned on "capitalism for all," promising to stabilize the economy by tackling corruption and the black market, while slowly phasing out fuel subsidies.

He also notes the significant drop in LiDAR system costs, making them more viable.

Curator Hamza Walker emphasizes that the exhibit confronts the "Lost Cause" ideology, asserting that the statues celebrated white supremacy and slavery, not noble causes.

          <p>Experts suggest a simple language shift—replacing "I can't" with "I don't"—can significantly help individuals establish and maintain boundaries at work. Career coach Helen Tupper explains that "I don't" is more definitive and less open to negotiation, allowing people to assert their limits effectively. This advice is crucial for preventing burnout, a condition characterized by exhaustion, detachment, and reduced performance, as experienced by TV chef Lorraine Pascale. Sticking to firm routines and aligning goals with current capacity are also recommended to manage stress and foster a healthier work-life balance.</p>
