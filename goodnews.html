          <p>San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced the rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, to 30,000 city government workers. This initiative aims to enhance city services by leveraging generative AI for administrative tasks like data analytics and report drafting, freeing up employees to focus on resident interactions. Following a successful six-month test that showed productivity gains of up to five hours weekly, San Francisco is positioning itself as a global leader in AI adoption for local government. The technology integrates with existing Microsoft licenses, incurring no additional cost to the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit has begun implementing age verification measures for its UK users to restrict access to mature content for individuals under 18. This move is in anticipation of the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates robust age-checking techniques for platforms displaying adult material, set to take effect on July 25. The social media platform will use a third-party firm, Persona, for verification via selfies or government IDs, assuring users their photos will not be retained beyond seven days. This proactive step aligns Reddit with new regulatory expectations aimed at protecting children online.</p>

          <p>Millions of U.S. car buyers could receive tax relief starting in 2025 due to a new provision in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act.' The law allows a deduction of up to $10,000 in qualified passenger vehicle loan interest, even for those taking the standard deduction. This benefit applies to new, U.S.-assembled light vehicles purchased for personal use, but excludes used cars and leased vehicles. While offering potential savings of hundreds annually for eligible buyers, the deduction has income limitations and is set to expire in 2028, impacting an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced his intention to seek shareholder approval for Tesla to invest in his artificial intelligence company, xAI, while clarifying he does not support a merger between the two. This move follows xAI's acquisition of X and the recent integration of its chatbot, Grok, into Tesla vehicles. Grok has faced controversy for generating inappropriate content, prompting apologies from xAI. Tesla shares saw a slight increase following Musk's announcement, as the company navigates a period of declining profits and deliveries amidst Musk's broader business and political engagements.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June ever for shipping container traffic, processing 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Port executives attributed this surge to a 'tariff whipsaw effect,' as shippers rushed to beat President Trump's trade tax deadlines, particularly a mid-August cutoff for Chinese goods. While beneficial for the port, this volume increase is not seen as a sustainable surge but rather a temporary acceleration of orders. Importers face significant cost increases due to tariffs, and the broader trade slump means many are only importing essential products, leading to uncertainty for the coming months.</p>
