          <h2>Semaglutide Shows Promising Results in Reversing Liver Disease in Clinical Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Participants receiving semaglutide, traditionally a treatment for type 2 diabetes, experienced a significant reduction in liver inflammation and fat accumulation compared to those receiving a placebo. Researchers also noted improvements in liver fibrosis and blood measures, along with an average weight loss of 10.5%. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group, the findings suggest it could be a valuable treatment option for fatty liver disease, pending regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The survivors, including three women, a child, and the pilot, were found by local fishermen. They stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators and an anaconda, using leaking petrol to keep the predators at bay. The survivors ate cassava flour brought by one of the passengers while awaiting rescue. They were transported to a hospital and found to be in excellent condition.</p>

          <p>BBC reporter Nada Tawfik shares her experience of interviewing Prince Harry in California, noting his down-to-earth demeanor and willingness to address difficult questions. Despite a recent court loss regarding his UK security, Prince Harry was eager to share his feelings. Tawfik felt it was important to ask why taxpayers should pay for his security and why protection on a case-by-case basis made him feel at greater risk. The interviewer also acknowledges the scrutiny surrounding the Duke and the importance of giving him space to share his perspective.</p>

          <h2>Antivenom Made From Man Bitten Hundreds of Times Shows Promise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxins. This is likely to provide coverage for many elapids for which there is no current antivenom.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had strengthened due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to maintain the currency's trading band. This intervention occurred ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected. The HKMA stated that the strength of the Hong Kong dollar was driven by increased demand related to equity investment activities and the appreciation of regional currencies. The HKMA will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate power under the Communist Party. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering media outlets, and cutting 100,000 public sector jobs. The goal is to make the state more agile and redirect resources to achieve high-income status by 2045. The shake-up also addresses dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign. The reforms are taking place ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress, which will determine the country's top leadership.</p>
