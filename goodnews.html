          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stressed the central bank's dedication to preventing an ongoing inflation problem, despite criticism from President Trump. Powell indicated that policymakers would likely maintain their current stance until the impact of tariffs on prices becomes clearer.

Powell's cautious approach could intensify Trump's disapproval, who has publicly criticized Powell's handling of monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has revealed details about its upcoming Tianwen-3 Mars sample return mission, which includes a plan to use a helicopter drone for collecting surface samples while avoiding biological contamination. The mission aims to retrieve at least 500 grams of Martian material by 2031, searching for signs of life. The drone will be equipped with a robotic arm and claw to retrieve larger rocks from over 100 meters away, transporting them back to the lander for return to Earth. Returned samples will be processed in a high-level biocontainment laboratory.</p>

          <p>With college tuition costs continuing to rise, some schools are offering substantial financial aid packages to help bridge the gap for students. For the 2024-25 school year, tuition and fees plus room and board for a four-year private college averaged $58,600. Experts recommend focusing on the actual amount students and families pay after scholarships and grants are deducted. Grants are considered the most desirable form of financial assistance, as they typically do not need to be repaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's groundwater supplies received a substantial boost in 2024, with an estimated 2.2 million acre-feet of water added to aquifers. Local agencies reported that approximately 1.9 million acre-feet of water went underground through managed aquifer recharge projects. This recharge occurred while the state is implementing water-saving programs to curb overpumping in the Central Valley. While the amount of replenishment was significant, it was less than the previous year due to extreme weather conditions.</p>
