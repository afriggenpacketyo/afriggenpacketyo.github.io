        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is re-evaluating the prominent "black box" warnings on menopause hormone therapy medications, which list risks such as stroke and breast cancer. Many medical experts now argue that the initial research from 2002, which led to these warnings, was flawed because it focused on older women and overstated the dangers for those who begin treatment closer to menopause. This potential change reflects an evolution in scientific understanding, suggesting that for many, the benefits of alleviating severe menopausal symptoms could outweigh the risks when therapy is properly timed and dosed.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer pushed back against the notion that the best days are over for the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, which include Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. He argues that these companies continue to be strong investments due to their great management, immense cash reserves, and unparalleled scale, which allows them to innovate and fend off competition. Citing examples like Apple's recent FDA clearance for its watch and a major stock buyback at Tesla, Cramer suggests that these giants remain compellingly valued and are positioned for future success.

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a proposal the Securities and Exchange Commission is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, echoing sentiments previously expressed by figures like Warren Buffett. While supporters believe it would foster better long-term management, critics argue that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency and timely information for investors, potentially causing more market difficulties.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal with China that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a nationwide ban set to take effect. The social media app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has faced scrutiny over concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or spread propaganda. While details remain undisclosed, any agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner, a politically sensitive issue given the app's massive popularity among young voters.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 18:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's board of directors is proposing a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth nearly $900 billion, designed to incentivize him to remain focused on the company. The plan requires Musk to grow Tesla's valuation to an unprecedented $8.5 trillion and meet other operational goals, which would in turn grant him a stock package increasing his ownership stake to around 25%. This move is seen as a direct response to Musk's public statements that he might divert his attention to his other ventures if his stake in Tesla was not increased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will create a legal "duty of candour" for public officials and bodies during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, championed by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, aims to end a "culture of cover-ups" by imposing criminal sanctions for dishonesty and ensuring legal funding for those affected. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law would change the balance of power, ensuring the state can no longer hide from the people it serves.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The introduction of the "Hillsborough Law" is the culmination of a nearly four-decade struggle for justice by the families and survivors of the 1989 stadium disaster that killed 97 people. This article explains that despite a 2016 inquest ruling the deaths were unlawful, a lack of accountability and a "culture of reputational defensiveness" from public authorities prolonged the suffering. The new law was conceived to address these injustices by creating a legal duty of candour for officials and ensuring equal legal funding for victims in future state-related disasters.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out an AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short audio summaries of products based on catalog descriptions, web information, and customer reviews. This tool aims to simplify the shopping experience by distilling vast amounts of text, but it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific insights found in human-written reviews. While potentially beneficial for accessibility, critics worry that blending marketing language with user feedback without attribution could dilute the authenticity that shoppers rely on to make informed decisions.</p>
