          <h2>Clownfish Found to Shrink in Response to Ocean Heat Waves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that clownfish are shrinking in size as an adaptation to survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures caused by climate change. Scientists measured clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea during a severe heat wave in 2023 and discovered that most of the fish got shorter over a period of months. This downsizing may help them cope with higher energy demands in warmer conditions and increase their chances of survival. The study highlights the complex ways in which marine life is adapting to climate change, even as coral reefs face devastating consequences from heat waves.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to help cover restructuring costs related to plant closures and job cuts. The struggling automaker may also book an additional 60 billion yen in restructuring costs this fiscal year. This decision comes after Nissan posted a significant net loss due to impairment losses and restructuring expenses. The company is streamlining its global operations to return to profitability, facing pressure from declining sales and U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies. Judge Susan Illston stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates. The order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. This ruling underscores the importance of Congressional oversight in the functioning of federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Charles Leclerc set the fastest time in the first practice session at the Monaco Grand Prix, despite complaining about his Ferrari's handling and colliding with Lance Stroll. Leclerc, who won the race last year, finished ahead of Max Verstappen and Lando Norris. His session was eventful, including taking an escape road and hitting Stroll's Aston Martin at the Loews hairpin, resulting in damage to his front wing and Stroll's rear suspension. Stroll also received a one-place grid penalty for the race.</p>

          <p>The Championship play-off final is anticipated to increase US investment in English football, driven by financial motives rather than reputational ones. US investors are attracted to the global game due to limited investment opportunities in US pro sports, fueled by factors like NBC's Premier League coverage and popular TV shows. These investors believe that English football has untapped revenue potential in media rights, ticketing, and sponsorship. With valuations differing between American football clubs and English football clubs, the latter provides an attractive opportunity for investment and growth.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn higher returns than inflation, with leading accounts providing strong interest rates that can be locked in for the term of the CD. These investments are generally FDIC or NCUA insured, making them safe for balances up to $250,000. Strategies to get a good CD rate include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve.

          <p>The article discusses current mortgage and refinance interest rates, highlighting the challenges faced by potential homebuyers and homeowners due to high rates and limited inventory. The average rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages are 6.08% and 6.89%, respectively, while refinance rates are 6.21% and 6.91%. Strengthening credit profiles, comparing lenders, and considering loan terms are crucial for securing a good rate.

          <p>Savings accounts, particularly high-yield options, offer a safe and effective way to store emergency funds and boost savings with competitive interest rates. High-yield savings accounts may offer rates up to 11 times higher than regular savings accounts. Online banks often provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs, making it easier for individuals to maximize their savings.
