          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK as the leader of its "Doge team" after resigning for two days, citing exhaustion from 11 months of building the party. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regretted his actions, attributing them to overwork. Yusuf explained his initial departure was due to exhaustion and a desire to reassess his priorities after dedicating nearly a year to the party. He will now take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media to promote Reform UK's policies. Optimism surrounding the party's future appears to have influenced his decision to return.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore cuts to police hiring made by the council. The deal ensures that council leadership will identify funds for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days, reversing a reduction in the number of officers hired in the coming fiscal year. Restoring the police recruits will require the council to allocate an additional $13.3 million for the coming year, with costs growing to about $60 million in 2026-27. The agreement aims to balance budget constraints with public safety concerns.</p>

These include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing and compensating former returnees from French Indochina, and addressing a "double debt" to Haiti.

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly half of Americans are making a significant mistake regarding Social Security, as many are not saving adequately for retirement. Ramsey's research indicates that a substantial portion of Americans are not currently saving for the future, and even among those who are, few are setting aside enough to afford a secure retirement. To address this, Ramsey recommends creating a savings benchmark, setting a higher savings rate, and prioritizing retirement savings to ensure a more comfortable financial future.
