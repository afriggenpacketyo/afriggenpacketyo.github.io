          <p>The government is considering implementing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, with proposals including a two-hour cap on individual social media apps and a 22:00 curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said he is examining the "addictive nature" of some apps and smartphones. Online safety campaigners have criticized the government for delaying the enactment of new laws to protect children. The government has said that it will be taking action to ensure age-appropriate material is supplied by platforms, otherwise criminal sanctions will be placed against them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships, starting with tone of voice or attitude, which often signals contempt. Other common issues include family relations, household chores, and communication styles, each reflecting deeper misalignments and unmet needs. The article suggests strategies for moving past these conflicts, such as naming the effect of a sour tone, reassuring one another in family disputes, acknowledging the uneven distribution of labor in chore-related arguments, and using a "five-second rule" to prevent communication from spiraling. Addressing these issues can lead to stronger, more fulfilling relationships.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the lead-up to last week's Holyrood by-election. Sarwar claimed the SNP's tactics pushed voters toward Reform UK, a charge Swinney refuted by citing Labour's collapsed vote share and his party's data showing a surge for Reform. Scottish Labour unexpectedly won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat, defeating the SNP. The first minister also indicated that he would consider a cabinet reshuffle in due course following the defeat.</p>

However, the author suggests that President Trump's policies have ironically diminished this threat. As the US shifts away from nation-building efforts and imposing its values on other nations, the fear of American subversion through peaceful means has receded in China, now a rising power challenging America's global dominance.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist addresses a reader's dilemma about ethical non-monogamy, where the husband is interested but the wife is not. Drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy of love, the columnist emphasizes the importance of freedom and supporting a partner's flourishing while cautioning against masochistic self-sacrifice. The advice centers on open communication, setting boundaries, and cultivating secure attachment within oneself and the relationship. The article suggests exploring non-monogamy only if both partners genuinely feel ready and interested, and it suggests a temporary relationship structure can help to ease into non-monogamy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs is challenged by the aviation industry's struggle to hire skilled workers. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and the industry faces a shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field, with base pay averaging between $80,000 and $90,000 a year at GE's engine plant in Lafayette, Indiana. The administration plans to raise wages and ramp up hiring to address these shortfalls.</p>

          <p>The article describes a visit to Paris, drawing parallels to Mark Twain's "The Innocents Abroad" and highlighting the city's intimidating atmosphere. The author discusses feeling like an "idiotic, disorganized, disheveled crumb bum" in Paris due to the language barrier and the city's beauty. Despite the intimidation, the author found joy in the butter, describing its rich, deep yellow color and creamy texture. The author also recounts an encounter with other Americans in the hotel lobby who were trying to figure out a way to transport butter home in their luggage.</p>
