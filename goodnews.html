          <p>Vice President Vance has publicly stated his continued support for President Trump while also acknowledging Elon Musk's frustrations with the president's budget bill. Vance emphasized his loyalty to Trump but described Musk as an "incredible entrepreneur" who has valid concerns about government spending. Musk, who previously led the Trump administration's cost-cutting DOGE initiative, has criticized the budget bill for potentially leading to unsustainable debt. Trump has responded by suggesting Musk would face consequences if he supports Democratic candidates and has threatened to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts. The situation presents a complex dynamic between key figures in the political and business spheres.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justice Clarence Thomas has long advocated for American law to prioritize individual rights over group affiliations, a principle that seems to be gaining traction within the Supreme Court. His views, rooted in the Declaration of Independence's promise of judging individuals as individuals, have been consistently expressed throughout his career. The recent Supreme Court decision in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, which rejects heightened evidentiary standards for majority-group plaintiffs in Title VII discrimination claims, reflects this shift. While proponents of DEI may hope the Ames decision has no bearing on their programs, Thomas clarifies that the decision is relevant, as such initiatives have often led to overt discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are reportedly scrambling to adhere to President Xi Jinping's austerity orders as inspectors conduct checks on their offices and spending habits. The campaign, which began in 2012, aims to curb overspending, improve the Communist Party's image, and combat corruption. Analysts suggest the effort is also intended to ensure resources are used efficiently in China's competition with the United States. The campaign's effectiveness is questioned due to media control and the difficulty of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>
