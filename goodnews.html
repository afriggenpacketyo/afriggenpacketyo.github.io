        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's global expansion comes amid increased competition and scrutiny over trade practices, including being placed on a U.S. watchlist due to suspected military links, which CATL denies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite trade war tensions with the U.S., China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and a Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest investors are moving away from U.S. dollar assets due to the trade war, and China's economic recovery is making it an attractive destination for investment. The weakening U.S. dollar is also contributing to the stability of the Chinese yuan.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others to study the behavior of seaweed at depth and assess the environmental impact. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, compared with 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China cut its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, reducing the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. The move is aimed at boosting the economy, supported by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced deposit rates, paving the way to lower key lending rates. Analysts expect further policy easing, forecasting additional lending rate reductions by year-end as part of a broader stimulus package.</p>

The agreement's details, including costs and specifics for defence cooperation and travel, are still being negotiated.
