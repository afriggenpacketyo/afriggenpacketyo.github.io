          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that equity prices appear to be "fairly highly valued" by many metrics. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell explained that the central bank monitors overall financial conditions to ensure its policies are achieving their intended effects. His comments follow a recent market rally spurred by the Fed's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate, which has pushed major stock indices to record highs. Despite noting the high valuations, Powell also stated that he does not believe this is a period of elevated financial stability risks, suggesting a balanced view of the current market environment.</p>

          <p>Lisa Jeanine Findley has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for orchestrating a sophisticated scheme to fraudulently sell Graceland, the historic home of Elvis Presley. Findley pleaded guilty to mail fraud, admitting to creating a fake company and forging documents to claim that Presley's late daughter, Lisa Marie, had used the estate as collateral for a non-existent $3.8 million loan. She then threatened to foreclose and auction the property unless the Presley family paid her $2.85 million. The judge described the plot to defraud the estate, now inherited by Riley Keough, as a "wild" and "highly sophisticated" scheme.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has sold out all passes for both of its weekends just three days after they went on sale. This marks a return to the rapid sellouts seen before the pandemic, following several years of slower sales for the major music event. The 2026 festival will be headlined by Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Karol G, and Anyma. The quick sales are a positive indicator for promoter Goldenvoice and the broader concert industry, which has seen some other festivals struggle or cancel in a soft market, suggesting strong demand for premier live music experiences.</p>

          <p>The popular online competition, Fat Bear Week, has officially begun, allowing the public to vote for the brown bear that has best prepared for winter hibernation by packing on the most weight. Hosted by Katmai National Park in Alaska, the single-elimination tournament pits 12 bears against each other, with voters observing them via live webcams as they feast on salmon from the Brooks River. Last year's champion, Grazer, is back to defend her title against contenders like Chunk. The event, which started as a small one-day contest in 2014, has grown into a global phenomenon that educates millions about the park's ecosystem.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that it is accelerating its plans for the Artemis II mission, which will send four astronauts on a flight around the Moon for the first time in over five decades. The agency is now targeting a launch as early as February 2026, ahead of its previous April schedule, citing that preparations are proceeding well. The 10-day mission is a critical step in NASA's program to return humans to the lunar surface. The push comes amid a renewed sense of a "second space race," as China advances its own lunar program with the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2030.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) that had been frozen. The judge ruled that the administration likely violated federal law by not providing specific procedures or explanations for the funding cuts, which were related to allegations of civil rights violations. The administration has been using its control over federal funding to pressure elite universities over issues like campus antisemitism and diversity initiatives. This ruling concerns hundreds of medical research grants, including studies on Parkinson's disease and cancer recovery.</p>

          <p>Health experts and regulatory agencies from around the world are strongly refuting the Trump administration's recent claims linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. The European Medicines Agency, the UK's regulatory body, and Australian health officials have all issued statements affirming that there is no new evidence to change current recommendations and that the medication remains a safe option for pregnant women. These international bodies join numerous U.S. medical groups in pushing back against the announcement made by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., emphasizing that robust scientific studies have not established a causal link.</p>
