          <p>Five mainland Chinese companies, including Muyuan Foods, BASiC Semiconductor, FS.com, Shanghai Seer, and Worldwide Logistics, have filed preliminary listing applications with the Hong Kong stock exchange. Muyuan Foods, a major pork producer, seeks to raise up to US$1 billion for global expansion. The filings mark the initial step in the Hong Kong IPO process, contributing to a sevenfold increase in IPO fundraising in Hong Kong compared to the same period last year. Hong Kong's IPO market has become a popular destination for Chinese start-ups, with the exchange raising nearly 90% of last year's full-year proceeds in the first five months of 2025.</p>

          <p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Polish voters to elect Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate backed by Donald Trump, in the upcoming presidential election. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in Poland, Noem described Nawrocki as a leader who would strengthen the U.S.-Poland relationship and protect conservative values. CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp framed the election as part of a global battle against "globalists," emphasizing the importance of winning elections to preserve freedom. The conference took place in a staunchly conservative region of Poland, which serves as a hub for U.S. and Western weapons sent to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. following a surge in China, though it's not yet included in federal variant-tracking dashboards. The variant has been detected in several states and is designated a SARS-CoV-2 variant under monitoring by the World Health Organization. While it may spread more easily, current data suggests it does not lead to more severe illness than other variants. Current COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant. However, the Trump administration is limiting access to vaccines, raising concerns among experts about potential impacts on public health.</p>

          <p>Wolves forward Matheus Cunha reportedly desires a move to Manchester United, despite the club's lack of Champions League football next season. Cunha views United as a significant club and is excited by the challenge of revitalizing their fortunes. The move could benefit all parties, with Cunha joining a bigger club and Wolves receiving over ¬£60 million to reinvest. United, who may allow Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to leave, need to bolster their attacking options after a poor scoring record last season. Cunha has scored 27 goals in 65 Premier League appearances and is seen as someone who can make an immediate impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A record number of puffins, 43,626, have been recorded on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, despite global populations declining rapidly. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales attributes the increase to an abundance of food and a lack of predators on the island. Skomer Island, managed by the WTSWW, is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills. While puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction globally, the thriving population on Skomer Island is considered a conservation success story, but continued protection is needed.</p>

Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, achieving the required benchmark of back-to-back championships as an ozeki. He joins Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university.

          <p>Democratic centrists are debating whether the party's representatives should use less "elite, highly educated" language when speaking to voters. Some argue that terms like "oligarchs," "food insecurity," and "social equity" alienate middle America. They suggest using more plainspoken language to connect with voters. Others argue that using nonprejudicial language is a good thing and that language evolves. Some believe that Democrats trip over themselves trying to say exactly the right thing, which can make them appear less authentic.</p>

It aims to have over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes and to cultivate at least 100 specialized service providers.

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law obliging 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries. Under the system, companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance, and they must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold from companies with a surplus. The goal is to incentivize companies to reduce emissions, but the costs may be passed on to consumers in the form of price hikes.</p>
