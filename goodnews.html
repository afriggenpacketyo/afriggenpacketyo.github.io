          <p>Chinese court astronomers documented details of a dying star's explosion in 1408, providing valuable insights for modern astronomers. The astronomers, during the Ming dynasty, observed a new star and described its size, color, and brightness in a formal report to the emperor. This rediscovered account confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow and temporary brightening caused by a dying star. The unprecedented details helped researchers narrow down the star's possible position, contributing to a better understanding of celestial events and historical astronomical observations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has fallen from 78% to 62%. This decline follows a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, stemming from disagreements over the president's spending bill. Despite the drop, Musk remains popular among Republicans, with 80% rating his work with the Department of Government Efficiency as either excellent or good. </p>
