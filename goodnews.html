          <h2>Medical Expert Warns Binge-Watching Television Can Negatively Impact Brain Health</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist and brain imaging specialist is cautioning against the common habit of staying up late to binge-watch television shows. According to the doctor, sacrificing sleep for entertainment prevents the brain from performing its essential nightly "cleaning" process, which can impair memory and decision-making skills the following day. He stresses that prioritizing an adequate amount of sleep is crucial for improving focus, energy, and overall cognitive function. The expert also notes that pre-bedtime screen exposure can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and increasing stress levels.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer urged investors to separate their political feelings about President Donald Trump from their financial decisions. He argued that despite reasons to dislike the president's persona, the market has shown resilience, driven by individual investor optimism and pro-business policies. Cramer pointed to factors like deregulation, a favorable environment for mergers, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence as forces that could continue to propel stocks higher, regardless of inflationary tariff policies. He suggested that while professionals are bearish, individual investors' faith in business is driving a powerful bull market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which is being described as his most raw and improvisational work to date. The album moves away from polished pop, instead featuring spacey, R&B-influenced grooves and a murky, unpolished production style that reflects a tumultuous period in the artist's life. The article reviews the album as a messy yet beautiful project, where Bieber explores themes of faith, love, and the pressures of fame with endearing frankness. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album aligns with a modern pop trend of embracing idiosyncratic and less-streamlined musical visions.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has emphasized that improving the nation's weather forecasting systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, plans to send bipartisan recommendations to President Trump for upgrading weather infrastructure, including Doppler radar and NOAA's computing power. Cantwell argued against proposed budget cuts to agencies like NOAA, stating that the investment is minuscule compared to disaster recovery costs. She highlighted that more accurate forecasting, as seen with tornado warnings in the Midwest, can save lives and prevent future tragedies.</p>
