          <p>Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies shared her experience of surviving a serious motorcycle accident, posting photos from the hospital on Instagram to warn her followers about road safety. The 21-year-old royal, who recently attended the Cannes Film Festival, crashed headfirst into a wall while riding a motorcycle and was in intensive care. She emphasized the importance of wearing full protective gear, especially a helmet, which she credits with saving her life. Maria Carolina expressed gratitude to the medical team at Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace for their expert care during her recovery, which happened days after she attended the Monaco Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his contributions to the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's time as a special government employee concludes. Trump stated that Musk's work has been unparalleled in modern history, despite DOGE's savings falling short of the promised $1 trillion. Musk, who was limited to 130 days of service, will remain involved as a friend and advisor to the president. The White House claims DOGE's efforts have saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest potential costs to the government due to lost productivity and workforce changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores the connection between therapy culture and declining fertility rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has created an impossible standard for parenting, leading to a dread of parenthood. The piece argues that the expectation for parents to be accountable for their children's mental health and happiness well into adulthood contributes to the trend of childlessness. The author posits that the high standards to which the current generation holds their own parents may be a reason why they are hesitant to become parents themselves.</p>

Musk's departure comes 130 days after Trump returned to office, the maximum allowable through his status as a special government employee, though Trump states he'll remain involved.</p>

          <p>Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins, and other name-brand products, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging. Mondelez alleges that Aldi "blatantly copies" the distinctive packaging of its brands to mislead customers into buying the supermarket chain's products. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling products that Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks. Mondelez claims that Aldi store-brand items have similar packaging design elements to its own popular snacks, such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, and Wheat Thins.</p>
