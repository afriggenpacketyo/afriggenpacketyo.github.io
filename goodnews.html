          <p>With the Powerball jackpot recently climbing to nearly $1.8 billion, a new analysis of government data reveals where Americans spend the most on lottery tickets. Residents of Massachusetts lead the nation, spending an average of $915 per person annually, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year. The data also shows that lottery sales can be a significant source of state revenue, accounting for up to 3% in some states.</p>

Additionally, Apple's annual hardware event on Tuesday, where the iPhone 17 is expected to be unveiled, will be closely watched for its potential impact on the tech sector and broader market sentiment.

          <p>Max Verstappen claimed a commanding victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, continuing his strong form. However, the race was marked by a controversial moment for the McLaren team, as Oscar Piastri was instructed to cede second place to his teammate, Lando Norris. The order was given after Norris lost the position due to a slow pit stop, prompting a debate about fairness but ultimately resulting in a team-directed swap on the track.</p>

The project aims to showcase the potential of fungal bio-materials as a biodegradable and environmentally friendly alternative to the plastics commonly used in marine recreation.</p>

          <p>This article posits that concerns over the recent elimination of the "de minimis" trade exemption, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, are largely overstated. The author argues that while some small businesses that rely on international goods will be negatively affected, the vast majority of small businesses in the U.S. are service-based and will not feel a direct impact. The piece suggests that the focus should instead be on broader economic indicators like income growth and consumer spending power. (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A major international study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people has revealed a consistent and long-standing pattern: individuals in couples often share the same psychiatric diagnoses. Researchers examined data from Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States across generations, finding significant spousal correlations for disorders like depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Potential reasons for this phenomenon include mutual understanding from shared experiences, similar environmental backgrounds, or the narrowing of dating pools due to social stigma.</p>
