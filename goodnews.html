          <p>The article provides advice for consumers who are struggling to keep up with their credit card payments. Missing payments can lead to late fees, increased interest rates, and damage to one's credit score, with the severity increasing at 30, 60, and 90-day delinquency marks. The article recommends taking immediate action by making minimum payments, contacting the credit card company to negotiate, and setting up payment reminders to avoid future issues. The piece further suggests exploring options like balance transfers or personal loans to consolidate debt and aggressively tracking budgets to allocate more funds towards debt repayment (not investment advice).</p>

She expresses a desire for growth and healing for the shooter, Dylan Roof, rather than harboring hatred.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has defended President Donald Trump's approach to Iran, asserting Trump's consistency in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Vance stated that Trump has encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with Iran to achieve this goal, emphasizing that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. These comments come amid growing divisions among Trump's supporters, with some, like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, opposing U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance assures that Trump is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has defended his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs, reversing his earlier stance where he accused those calling for one of jumping on a far-right bandwagon. The inquiry comes after a report highlighted poor data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators and suggested officials had "shied away" from the issue. Starmer stated that the national inquiry "must go wherever it needs to go, whether that's a question of ethnicity or the role of public officials". The report also calls for adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 to face the most serious charge of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was unlawful. The judge stated that the cuts, which targeted research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, represented unlawful discrimination. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit.

The blackout was triggered by a voltage surge in southern Spain, which led to small grid failures and a chain reaction of protective shutdowns.

Platforms like Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock have shifted to complement, rather than compete with, linear TV. Netflix has emerged as the clear winner in the paid subscription service category, with a viewing gain of 27% over the past four years.</p>
