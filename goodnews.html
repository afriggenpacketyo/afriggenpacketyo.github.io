        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a controversy over a sandal design. The move comes after critics pointed out the strong resemblance of a Prada sandal to the traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappal, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, representing Kolhapuri artisans, engaged in talks with Prada, including a senior executive from the company. This initiative is being viewed as a potential model for respectful collaboration between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from conducting certain immigration raids in several Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prohibits federal agents from making detentive stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The decision comes in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU and other groups, which argued that recent enforcement actions involved unconstitutional racial profiling and other violations of rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform without their consent. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright misuse of training data will proceed. The case is a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over intellectual property.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are increasingly establishing a global footprint, driven by growing demand from Chinese companies expanding abroad and encouragement from Beijing. The number of overseas Chinese legal offices has grown significantly, responding to a preference among Chinese businesses for legal support from trusted domestic lawyers. While they are successfully serving their compatriots, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions. This expansion marks a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry as it navigates the complexities of the international market.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted an emergency ban preventing air passengers from carrying substandard portable power banks onto flights. The move follows several incidents where defective units caught fire during air travel, increasing public scrutiny of the product's safety. Under the new rule, portable lithium-ion batteries lacking the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark are barred from domestic flights. The regulation has caused some confusion among travelers and highlighted the safety risks associated with the widely used electronic accessories.</p>
