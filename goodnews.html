          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived in Canada on a symbolic visit, showing support for the country amid political tensions. The visit comes after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested annexing Canada, a notion firmly rejected by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. King Charles's visit, his first since becoming king, includes opening Parliament, a duty last performed by Queen Elizabeth 68 years ago. The visit also comes as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer attempts to navigate trade and war in Ukraine with Trump.</p>

          <p>Trainer David Hayes expresses optimism about Chateauneuf's prospects in the Class Three Seine Handicap at Happy Valley, despite a less-than-ideal barrier draw. Chateauneuf is coming off a recent victory and Hayes believes the horse's trackwork suggests he has maintained his form. Hayes also provided positive updates on Rubylot, who finished second in a Group One race, and superstar sprinter Ka Ying Rising, who is preparing to return to competition in October. Hayes remains in contention for the trainers‚Äô title.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, has returned home to Tehran. Panahi's winning film, *It Was Just Accident*, depicts torture in Iranian jails. His return follows multiple imprisonments in Iran and a 15-year absence from Cannes due to a travel ban. Panahi's win has sparked a diplomatic row between French and Iranian officials, with France praising the film as a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime.</p>

          <p>High-end jewellery designers are incorporating subtle, hidden details into their pieces, transforming them into personal narratives and symbols of memory and artistry. Swiss jewellery house G√ºbelin incorporates rubies into less visible areas of their creations, while other houses like Van Cleef & Arpels use techniques like the Mystery Setting to conceal metal and create seamless surfaces. Designers are also incorporating personal elements like hair and wood into their pieces, offering wearers a private connection to their jewellery and a reminder that true beauty lives beneath the surface.</p>
