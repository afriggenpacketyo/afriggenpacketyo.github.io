          <h2>Former Official Urges China to Boost Household Income to Stimulate Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 20:00:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former senior Chinese official, Yang Weimin, suggests that China should prioritize increasing household income to drive economic growth over the next five years. Yang, who previously helped draft five-year plans, believes weak consumer demand is primarily due to insufficient income. He specifically mentioned the need to raise the share of household disposable income in national income and boost consumer spending's share of total demand. This proposal comes ahead of a Communist Party meeting where members will discuss China's next five-year plan, which is expected to emphasize income, GDP growth, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation. The emphasis on household income suggests a shift towards a more consumer-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Actor Tim Allen expressed being deeply moved by Erika Kirk's forgiveness of her husband's alleged killer, Charlie Kirk. Allen shared on X that Kirk's memorial speech inspired him to forgive the man who killed his own father in 1978. Allen, who was 11 at the time of his father's death, stated that he had struggled for over 60 years to forgive the drunk driver. Erika Kirk's forgiveness at her husband's memorial service sparked widespread admiration, as she said that her husband wanted to save young men like the one who took his life, expressing forgiveness in line with Christian values.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank, addressing concerns raised by far-right Israeli officials who have pushed for annexation in response to Western countries recognizing Palestinian statehood. Trump made these remarks after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss resolving the Gaza conflict. The U.S. President also met with leaders from several Arab and Muslim countries at the UN to discuss the war in Gaza, where the Arab and Muslim countries made it clear to the president the danger of annexation of any type in the West Bank, and the risk that poses, not just for the potential of peace in Gaza, but also to any sustainable peace at all.</p>

          <h2>Oil Giant BP Steps Out of Takeover Speculation</h2>

          <p>BP's shares have risen significantly since April, outperforming many rivals, effectively removing the company from the spotlight as a potential takeover target. This improvement is attributed to a strategic reset, leadership changes, cost-cutting progress, and recent oil discoveries. Earlier in the year, BP was subject to takeover speculation, with companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil mentioned as possible suitors. BP's CEO insists the company is focused on growth, and analysts cite the selection of a new chair with turnaround experience as a positive catalyst. The company's recent financial results have also exceeded expectations, further bolstering investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Victims of the January 7 fire storms in California will receive up to one year of mortgage relief under new legislation signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Assembly Bill 238 allows borrowers to suspend mortgage payments for up to 12 months without penalties by attesting to financial hardship caused by the fires. The law prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating or executing foreclosures during this period. This relief provides support to homeowners rebuilding after the disaster, easing the financial burden of making mortgage payments on uninhabitable properties. The bill aims to help stabilize those affected by the fires.</p>
