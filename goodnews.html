          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in March 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft was stranded in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back ever since. Experts predict the re-entry will occur around May 10th, but the exact location remains unknown, though it will be between 52 degrees north and south latitude. Despite the spacecraft's protective heat shield, which was designed to survive the Venusian atmosphere, there is a small chance some parts could survive the re-entry and reach the surface, although the risk of injury on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association after being sanctioned for remarks made to a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan questioned the player's gender and raised concerns about fairness and safety with the referee, leading to a six-match ban for improper conduct. An FA appeal board later found the initial hearing unfair, quashed the ruling, and ordered a new process, but the case was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan states the case has significantly impacted her life and feels the FA put her through unnecessary stress.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, partner of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions for a new AI-driven biotech startup called Haemanthus, aiming to improve medical testing. Holmes, currently serving an 11-year sentence for fraud, is reportedly advising Evans on the project, though her exact role is unclear. The company is focused on Raman spectroscopy, a technology with potential applications in diagnosing diseases like ALS and cancer. Haemanthus hopes to reduce the cost and expand the availability of this technology, but is still in the early stages of development, and Holmes is not planning to take a formal role helping Evans run the company.</p>

          <p>Mexico is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following an executive order by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The Mexican President, Claudia Sheinbaum, argues that the change affects Mexican territory and sovereignty, as the gulf is shared between the U.S., Mexico, and Cuba. Google's policy is to follow the official names used by each country, resulting in the Gulf being labeled differently depending on the user's location. The lawsuit comes after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Gulf of America Act to codify Trump's order.</p>

The proposals also include extending the waiting period for migrants to apply for permanent residency and implementing tougher English language requirements.
