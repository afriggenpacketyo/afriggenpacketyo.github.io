          <p>China's central authorities have issued new guidelines for local governments on the implementation of artificial intelligence, explicitly warning them not to grant AI models access to sensitive data or state secrets. The document outlines approved uses for AI, such as answering public inquiries, monitoring infrastructure with drones, and assisting with administrative tasks like drafting documents. This move aims to improve government efficiency while establishing strict safety protocols, requiring thorough evaluations and training in AI ethics and security before any systems are deployed for official use.</p>

          <p>Doncaster electrician Josh Padley has successfully transitioned into a full-time professional boxer after a life-changing, albeit unsuccessful, fight against world champion Shakur Stevenson. Despite taking the bout on only four days' notice and suffering his first career defeat, the high-profile opportunity earned him a significant payday and a multi-fight contract with a major promoter. Padley, who previously treated boxing as a hobby, credits his readiness to seize the unexpected opportunity for his ability to quit his day job and fully dedicate himself to the sport.</p>

These projects aim to fill critical manufacturing gaps in Africa, which currently imports approximately 70 percent of its essential medicines despite bearing a quarter of the world's disease burden.</p>

          <p>Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has established himself as the clear frontrunner for the Premier League's Golden Boot award after scoring nine goals in his first seven games of the season. An analysis of his performance shows that he is not only scoring frequently but is also receiving a significantly higher number and quality of scoring chances compared to his rivals. His expected goals (xG) figure from normal play is more than double that of any other player, making him a strong favorite even if his finishing were only average.</p>

          <p>Speaking publicly for the first time since his release, British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah described the process of learning to live again after spending over a decade as one of Egypt's most prominent political prisoners.

While he plans to return to the UK, Abdel Fattah stated that his days of street activism are over, though he remains committed to fighting for a better world.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 01:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Social Democrats are pushing to close a legal loophole by criminalizing verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as 'catcalling.' Currently, such behavior is not explicitly covered under sexual offenses legislation and is rarely prosecuted under existing insult laws. Proponents argue that targeted, unwanted harassment is a form of violence that intimidates victims and restricts their access to public spaces. The debate follows similar legal changes in other European countries like Belgium, France, and Spain, which have already enacted laws against street harassment.</p>

The joint action, to be coordinated with the US, aims to provide substantial financial support to Ukraine and compel Russia to enter negotiations to end the war. (not investment advice)</p>

The checkup, which the White House called routine, comes as the 79-year-old president prepares for an upcoming trip to the Middle East.</p>
