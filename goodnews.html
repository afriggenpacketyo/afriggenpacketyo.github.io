          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender high school athlete, competed in the California track and field championships, facing both support and protests. The event drew national attention, including criticism from President Trump, who threatened to pull federal funding. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) implemented a policy change to allow an additional athlete to receive a medal in events where a transgender athlete placed. One person was arrested following an altercation between protesters and counterprotesters, but the events continued without disruption as coaches and participants voiced their support for Hernandez. The competition proceeded despite the controversies.</p>

She notes that tariffs can affect the Chinese tech sector directly, making it harder to compete in the US market, and indirectly, causing firms to look to other markets and deepen trade with Europe. In response to the chip embargo, many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models, a cost-effective and collaborative way to develop advanced technologies when resources are tight. Despite challenges, Chinese firms are expected to continue pushing hard to make their products more competitive.</p>
