          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), experienced a major outage that disrupted numerous popular websites and applications worldwide, including Snapchat, Roblox, and even Amazon's own services like Ring and Alexa. The issue originated in its eastern U.S. region, causing widespread error rates and latency for its vast client base. AWS engineers worked to mitigate the problem, reporting significant signs of recovery within hours. The incident highlights the global economy's heavy reliance on a few large cloud infrastructure providers, where a single failure can have a cascading impact across the internet.</p>

          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. He suggested that moderate Democrats may soon vote to reopen the government, allowing for policy negotiations to resume through regular order. However, Hassett also warned that if the impasse continues, the Trump administration might consider imposing "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to cooperate. The shutdown stems from a partisan conflict over federal funding, particularly concerning the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual "Carrie Bradshaw index," which identifies the U.S. cities where a person with a median income can afford to live in a studio apartment alone. The index is based on the rule that rent should not exceed 30% of gross income. This year, Wichita, Kansas, ranked as the most affordable city, where median wages are 75% higher than what is needed for an average studio. The report noted that several cities in Texas, including Dallas and Austin, have become unaffordable this year, reflecting shifting rental markets and population influxes.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed companies involved in the rare earth supply chain experienced a surge as the Trump administration signals a stronger industrial policy to combat China's control over the critical minerals market. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced plans to set a price floor for rare earths to prevent market manipulation. This has fueled investor speculation that the government will back more domestic miners, following a deal already struck with MP Materials, the largest U.S. producer. These minerals are essential for high-tech manufacturing, including electric vehicles and defense systems. (not investment advice)</p>

Domestically, his administration finalized a long-negotiated economic partnership with the European Union to boost investment and growth.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the U.S. should mandate Medicaid coverage for GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs, such as Ozempic, to address the nation's obesity crisis affecting over 100 million adults. While the high cost of these medications presents a significant budgetary challenge for states, the author contends that these expenses are overstated. The piece suggests that long-term healthcare savings, opportunities for price negotiation with pharmaceutical companies, and the expected decrease in drug prices over time would offset the initial investment. Denying coverage to low-income populations on Medicaid creates further health inequalities.</p>

He identifies three key abilities that make individuals more employable and effective: being receptive to critical feedback, cultivating social awareness by focusing on others' needs, and demonstrating adaptability by stepping outside one's comfort zone. These components of emotional intelligence allow professionals to navigate workplace dynamics effectively, close the gap between self-perception and reality, and foster continuous personal and professional growth.</p>
