          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate, citing concerns about his competency due to worsening dementia. Menzies was sentenced for a 1986 murder and had chosen to be executed by firing squad. His lawyers argued that his cognitive decline is so severe he cannot understand why he is being executed, a standard for competency established in U.S. Supreme Court precedents. The court has ordered a lower court to reevaluate Menzies' mental fitness, acknowledging the suffering of the victim's family but emphasizing their obligation to uphold the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, a 42-year-old London Assembly member, has been elected as the new leader of the UK's Green Party, promising a more confrontational, "eco-populist" approach. With a background as an actor and hypnotherapist, Polanski represents a shift from the party's more established figures, aiming to connect with voters on an emotional level. He advocates for radical policies like a Universal Basic Income and has signaled a willingness to collaborate with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's new left-wing party. His victory poses a new challenge to the Labour Party as he seeks to build a broader "Green left" movement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers with the USDA are experimenting with an unconventional method to protect cattle from gray wolves: drones equipped with loudspeakers. The drones blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and clips from films like "Marriage Story" to haze the predators and interrupt their hunts. This creative, nonlethal approach is being tested on ranches near the California-Oregon border as wolf populations recover and conflicts with ranchers increase. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, early results show that the novel and varied sounds can successfully frighten the wolves away, offering a potential tool for human-wildlife coexistence.</p>

The new venture will launch in 16 states, primarily those where traditional sports betting is not yet legal. In these markets, users trade on the outcomes of sporting events without a traditional bookmaker, with odds fluctuating based on market activity. The partnership allows Underdog to enter a rapidly growing industry, leveraging Crypto.com's federally registered derivatives exchange to navigate the complex regulatory landscape surrounding whether these markets constitute gambling.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard members and U.S. Marines for domestic law enforcement in Los Angeles. The 1878 law prohibits using the military for such purposes, and the court found the deployment to counter immigration enforcement protests was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer issued an injunction blocking the administration from using military troops for civilian law enforcement activities in the state. The ruling represents a significant legal check on executive power, though the judge has temporarily stayed the decision to allow for an appeal.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back customers who have reduced their spending due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The new value menu, launching September 8, will feature deals such as a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move comes after the company's CEO acknowledged a significant drop in traffic from low-income consumers, who are facing increased financial pressure. By re-emphasizing affordability, the fast-food giant aims to boost sluggish sales, particularly during breakfast hours, and better compete for diners on a tight budget.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have arrested three dockworkers in Sydney after discovering over 1,100 pounds of cocaine hidden inside a shipping container. The drugs, with an estimated street value exceeding $107 million, were concealed behind a false wall. The arrests are part of a broader investigation targeting "trusted insiders" within supply chains who use their positions to facilitate drug smuggling for organized crime groups. The men, two of whom were forklift drivers, face potential life sentences if convicted, highlighting law enforcement's efforts to combat large-scale narcotics importation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, financial experts advise that now is a crucial time for savers to strategize their use of certificates of deposit (CDs). They recommend locking in current high rates before they drop, as even a small rate cut could quickly lead to lower returns on savings products. Other suggested moves include considering no-penalty CDs for greater flexibility and using a "CD ladder" strategy to balance access to funds with earning potential. Experts also stress the importance of shopping around at different banks and credit unions to find the best available rates and terms. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that new tax legislation from the Trump administration could create a "golden opportunity" for more investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate in 2025. The 0% rate applies to individuals and couples below certain taxable income thresholds, which may be more attainable due to new deductions. This could allow investors to engage in "tax-gain harvesting" by selling profitable assets without incurring taxes, or to sell and rebuy assets to reset their cost basis for future tax benefits. The strategy is particularly useful for those in lower-income years or for rebalancing portfolios tax-efficiently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark U.S. legal case, Russell Marubbio has been convicted of a 1987 sexual assault based on DNA evidence that distinguished him from his identical twin brother. Typically, identical twins are genetically indistinguishable, but scientists at Parabon Nanolabs used advanced techniques to identify rare, subtle mutations in the DNA. This "ultra-deep sequencing" allowed investigators to definitively link the crime scene sample to one twin over the other. The conviction marks the first time this specific type of genetic analysis has been successfully used in a U.S. court, setting a new precedent for solving crimes involving identical twins.</p>

          <p>Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global, contends that the traditional investment model centered on public stocks and bonds is "broken" and that investors should look to private markets for better diversification and returns. He argues that the public stock market has become dominated by a few mega-tech companies and passive index funds, no longer reflecting the full breadth of the economy. Rowan believes that private credit, which has grown exponentially as bank lending has become more regulated, offers a more effective way to invest in corporate America. He suggests that private markets are not inherently riskier than public ones, just less liquid. (not investment advice)</p>

While local broadcast groups like Nexstar and Sinclair have been pushing for consolidation to compete with Big Tech, filings show the national networks also want the ability to expand their station portfolios. These networks argue they face the same competitive pressures and should not be treated differently from independent station owners.

The loan was secured more than a month after the all-cash purchase, a practice known as delayed financing. This has led to speculation, though real estate experts suggest it is not necessarily a sign of financial trouble. Instead, it could be a strategic financial decision to maintain liquidity for other investments or for tax and estate planning purposes, allowing the homeowner to leverage the property's value while keeping cash free.</p>
