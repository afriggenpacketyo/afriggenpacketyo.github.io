          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from clinching the National League West title following a 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team overcame a struggling bullpen, which surrendered a late-game lead for the second consecutive night. Crucial to the win were scoreless relief appearances from starters Roki Sasaki, in his return from the injured list, and Clayton Kershaw, who pitched his first relief inning since 2019. Tommy Edman drove in the decisive run in the 11th inning to secure the important victory.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, jumped 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut after the company raised $1.2 billion in its initial public offering. The successful IPO reflects the company's aggressive expansion into international markets, including Europe and the Middle East, and highlights the continued investor interest in Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers. Analysts note that Chery's strategy of establishing local manufacturing in various countries helps mitigate risks from the high tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs by the U.S., Canada, and the EU.

Forecasters are also closely monitoring a second weather system in the northeast Caribbean, which has a high probability of developing into a tropical depression later this week.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's policy of requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration agents to receive certain FEMA grants is unconstitutional. The decision sides with 20 states that sued the Department of Homeland Security, arguing that critical emergency preparedness funding was being illegally withheld to enforce the administration's immigration agenda. The judge found the policy to be "arbitrary and capricious," stating that states would suffer irreparable harm from the loss of disaster funds, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts against "sanctuary" jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have unsealed a superseding indictment charging 26 individuals, including high-ranking members of the Sinaloa cartel, with involvement in a major drug trafficking and money laundering conspiracy.

This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread its massive computing costs over time while ensuring a dedicated revenue stream for Nvidia, though it has fueled investor concerns about the circular nature of capital within the AI industry.

The data underscores China's dominant role in the global solar supply chain and its growing influence on Africa's energy infrastructure transition.</p>

This initiative offers a sustainable alternative for a generation of farmers nearing retirement, preserving their land's ecological value for public benefit.</p>

          <p>A jewelry store in San Ramon, California, which had been robbed previously, utilized innovative security measures to thwart a recent heist by a large group of armed suspects. As between 20 and 25 individuals smashed display cases, the store's security system activated, locking the front door and temporarily trapping them inside. Although the suspects eventually shot their way out, the delay allowed law enforcement to track their getaway vehicles using helicopters and drones. The enhanced security, combined with a tracker in a stolen watch from a previous robbery, has led to multiple arrests.</p>
