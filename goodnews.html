        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after recent floods, reducing the count from nearly 100 to just three. This positive development follows extensive verification efforts by state and local agencies, which confirmed many reported missing were actually safe. The devastating floods, which occurred around July 4, resulted in a statewide death toll of 134, with 107 of those fatalities in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the widespread tragedy as recovery efforts continue across the affected areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a Wisconsin murder case, modern technology played a crucial role in both exonerating an initial suspect and convicting the actual killer. After Nicole Vander Heyden was murdered, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was arrested but later cleared when his Fitbit data corroborated his alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the crime. Investigators then used DNA from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Burch's location data from his Android phone's Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene, where the body was dumped, and near where her belongings were discarded, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a top advisor to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after a six-month tenure. Fulcher stated the decision was his own and that he had planned to serve for this duration before moving on amicably. During his time, he advised on personnel and policy, contributed to reviews of major acquisition programs, and supported initiatives to redirect funds toward military readiness. The Department of Defense confirmed the departure and expressed gratitude for his service, though a replacement has not yet been named.</p>

Despite the challenging weather conditions that interrupted play, England established an early lead and maintained control throughout the game, finishing with a final score of 40-5.

          <h2>UK Government to Introduce New Law Targeting Mass Attack Plotters</h2>

          <p>Following the deadly Southport attack, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to target individuals who plan mass violence but lack a specific ideological motive required for terrorism charges. The proposed legislation would allow police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, such as researching a target, closing a legal gap. This change aims to treat the plotting of mass attacks by lone, violence-obsessed individuals with the same seriousness as terrorism, giving law enforcement more tools to prevent future tragedies before they can occur.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the United Kingdom over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help mitigate learning loss, especially for disadvantaged students, and ease the childcare and financial burdens on working parents. However, many teachers oppose the idea, viewing the long holiday as essential for rest and preparation. The discussion also considers the impact on family vacation costs and the potential effects of increasingly hot summers on the school calendar, with varied opinions from parents and pupils.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has stated that savers are missing out on financial rewards due to an overly cautious approach to investing in stocks and shares. The government plans to encourage a shift from low-interest cash savings accounts toward investments by sending targeted information and launching a new promotional campaign. While a controversial proposal to cut the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs has been paused, the goal remains to channel more of the public's savings into the UK economy. Experts note that overcoming risk aversion, especially among women, will be a significant challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of private, members-only clubs is gaining popularity in India, catering to the country's growing class of young entrepreneurs and creative professionals. Unlike the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas reserved for old money and established figures, modern clubs like Soho House offer a more relaxed and contemporary environment. These spaces serve not only as social havens but also as networking hubs for a new, self-made elite. This trend reflects India's economic transformation and the rising demand for exclusive spaces that prioritize personal accomplishment over family legacy.</p>
