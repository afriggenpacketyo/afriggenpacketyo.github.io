          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move that could impact how artificial intelligence models are trained. Website owners using Cloudflare's services, which handle a substantial portion of global internet traffic, will now have to explicitly opt-in to allow their content to be used by firms like OpenAI and Google. This action aims to return control and potential revenue to content creators who are losing traffic to AI-generated answers and summaries.</p>

A coalition of local activists, former prison employees, and religious groups are citing the facility's troubled history, which includes violence, understaffing, and alleged abuse, as reasons for their opposition. The conflict represents a notable local pushback against the private prison industry's expansion under the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>In an effort to bolster foreign investor confidence amid ongoing trade disputes with the U.S. and E.U., China has introduced new tax incentives for foreign companies. The policy allows firms to deduct 10% of their onshore tax liability if they reinvest their China-earned profits back into local operations. This move, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is a key part of Beijing's broader strategy to signal economic openness and retain foreign capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California system is officially studying a potential switch from its traditional quarter system to a semester-based academic calendar for all its undergraduate campuses. Proponents believe the change would better align the universities with most other U.S. institutions, simplifying transfers and improving access to internships. However, the proposal faces significant hurdles, including an estimated cost between $288 million and $371 million and concerns from faculty about increased workload and potential disruption to student learning during the transition period.</p>
