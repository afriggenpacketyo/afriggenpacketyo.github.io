          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Muscat for the fourth round of indirect talks with the United States regarding Iran's nuclear program, just before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Araghchi expressed hope for a "decisive" outcome, but emphasized that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and non-negotiable, particularly enrichment achieved through the "blood of our scientists." He also stated that the constant change of American's positions is a problem with the negotiations. The article highlights the sensitive nature of these discussions and the firm stance taken by Iranian officials.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo defended owner Marinakis's post-match intervention following a draw against Leicester, attributing it to "confusion" over a substitution. The owner was reportedly frustrated after a player substitution did not proceed as expected due to a player's injury. Nuno emphasized that Marinakis's passion drives the club's growth and improvement, and that his actions reflect a shared frustration and high expectations. He praised the owner's commitment and desire to make the club better.</p>

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "a great deal of productivity," while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested the differences between the two countries were not as large as thought.

          <p>A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme have taken place in Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said the discussions in Muscat were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as "difficult but useful". The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme.</p>
