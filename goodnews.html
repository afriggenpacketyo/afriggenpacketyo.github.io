          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors are recommending investors adjust their portfolios to balance risk and potential earnings. Unlike previous rate-cutting cycles during major economic crises, the current cuts are occurring in a relatively strong economy, creating a unique environment. Advisors suggest strategies such as locking in intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds and maintaining a well-diversified equity portfolio without chasing high-flying sectors. The key is to remain disciplined and prepared for shifts in market performance as economic conditions evolve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly refuted claims by David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, that the company promotes a "woke" agenda. Amodei stated that Anthropic's policy goals, such as establishing a uniform federal approach to AI regulation, align with the Trump administration's objectives. The dispute arose after Sacks criticized the company for what he termed "fear-mongering" to achieve regulatory capture, particularly concerning state-level AI laws in places like California. Amodei emphasized the company's commitment to ensuring AI benefits all Americans and maintaining the nation's leadership in the field.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released a white paper detailing significant changes to higher and vocational education, raising questions from students and educators. University tuition fees and maintenance loans are set to increase with inflation annually starting in 2026. For post-GCSE students, new "V-level" qualifications will be introduced from 2027 to streamline and replace the current landscape of vocational courses like many BTecs. The government aims to improve the quality and perception of vocational training, though concerns remain about university finances and the impact on students from lower-income backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Japan has elected Sanae Takaichi as its first-ever female prime minister, a significant milestone for the nation. Takaichi, 64, is known as an ultraconservative member of the Liberal Democratic Party, drawing comparisons to Margaret Thatcher and holding hawkish views on China and immigration. Despite her socially conservative stances, which include advocating for traditional gender roles, her rise from a non-political family is notable in Japanese politics. Her leadership is expected to continue the conservative legacy of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and she has already indicated a friendly posture toward U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

While the Education Department is closed, many services can still be accessed through the Studentaid.gov website, including applications for repayment plans and loan consolidation. Additionally, loan servicers, which are government contractors, continue to operate normally for tasks like processing payments and forbearance requests. Borrowers can also seek assistance from nonprofit organizations and state student loan ombudsmen for more complex issues during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a dramatic surge, rising over 80% on Tuesday after a 127% jump the previous day. The rally was triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a short squeeze against investors betting against the stock. This marks a significant turnaround for the company, which had seen its stock price fall to penny-stock levels after peaking in 2019. The renewed speculative interest in Beyond Meat reflects a broader trend of retail traders re-engaging with volatile "meme" stocks in the current bull market. (not investment advice)</p>

The transfer agreement, which also includes another seriously ill British national, was signed by senior ministers from both countries.

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American to lead New York's Central Synagogue, is sharing her perspective on faith and belonging in her new memoir, "Heart of a Stranger." Born to a Jewish American father and a Korean Buddhist mother, Buchdahl explains how her experience feeling like an outsider shaped her belief in "radical compassion." She argues that empathy, cultivated from this feeling of not belonging, is a core Jewish value and the key to true faith. Her message of inclusion and understanding has resonated widely, especially amid rising antisemitism and political polarization.</p>

With no reported deaths and fewer injuries this year, there is cautious optimism about the whales' future. However, conservation groups stress that the species remains dangerously close to extinction and urge the government to strengthen protections against vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement.</p>

The ruling comes after students and families, represented by the ACLU, filed a lawsuit claiming their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were removed. The removals followed executive orders from President Trump and memoranda from the Secretary of Defense prohibiting materials promoting "gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." The judge determined the removals were based on "improper partisan motivation" rather than pedagogical concerns.</p>
