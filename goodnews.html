He also mentioned that deals negotiated by Greer and Howard Lutnick will be presented to the President once the China matter is resolved.

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury investments, with ultra-short bond ETFs attracting significant inflows, as evidenced by the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) being among the top ETFs in investor flows this year. This trend aligns with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway doubling its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries. The preference for shorter maturities reflects concerns about volatility and a desire for stable yields, with the 3-month T-Bill currently paying above 4.3% annually.</p>
