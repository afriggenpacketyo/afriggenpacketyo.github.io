        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to increase the number of regular donors to over one million, ensuring a stable blood supply. Supplies have been critically low, especially for O negative blood types, leading to an "amber alert" last year which impacted patient treatment. The NHSBT is particularly emphasizing the need for more black donors, who are more likely to possess blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease. Only a small fraction of the population donates regularly, and while donor registrations increased in 2024, only a quarter proceeded to donate. The NHS aims to prevent a "red alert" scenario, where demand exceeds capacity, by increasing donor numbers. </p>
