          <p>A coalition of 30 major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has formally called on the UK government to create a national strategy for stablecoins to prevent falling behind the United States in financial innovation. In an open letter to the Finance Minister, they argued that the UK should view stablecoins as a financial infrastructure to be embraced responsibly, rather than as a risk to be contained. The group believes a proactive and coordinated national strategy would significantly bolster the UK's position as a global financial hub and generate new revenue streams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting a Texas law that would have required every public school classroom in the state to display the Ten Commandments. The ruling states the law likely violates the First Amendment's establishment clause, which separates church and state, as it could unconstitutionally pressure students into religious observance. This decision marks the latest setback for such legislation, following similar legal challenges that have blocked laws in states like Louisiana and Arkansas, potentially setting the stage for a future Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>The business of securely erasing data from used and discarded IT equipment, known as IT asset disposition (ITAD), is experiencing rapid growth due to heightened cybersecurity concerns. With a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste produced globally in 2022, ensuring that sensitive personal and corporate data on old devices is properly destroyed has become a critical service. ITAD providers utilize methods like physical shredding, specialized software wiping, and degaussing to prevent data breaches, as improperly handled assets are now a common source of costly data loss.</p>

          <p>Google has officially launched its new Pixel 10 series of smartphones, which heavily integrate the company's Gemini AI assistant to compete in the increasingly AI-driven device market. The new lineup includes several models at various price points and introduces AI-powered features like "Magic Cue," designed to anticipate user needs by surfacing relevant information contextually. This release strategically positions Google to challenge Apple, whose own AI suite is considered by some critics to be less advanced, and aims to showcase the full potential of its Android software.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues AI Conversations Will Create New Revenue for Google and Publishers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 11:53:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An op-ed by Taboola CEO Adam Singolda posits that generative AI, despite reducing traditional search traffic, will usher in a more valuable economic era for both Google and online publishers. The author argues that high-value conversations facilitated by Large Language Models—on topics like travel, health, or commerce—are worth significantly more than simple search clicks, potentially transforming Google's revenue model. This shift also presents a major opportunity for publishers to host their own AI conversations, leveraging their established trust and expertise to guide users through complex decisions.

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has turned down an improved £40 million bid from Newcastle United for their striker, Yoane Wissa. The offer reportedly consisted of a £35 million initial payment plus £5 million in performance-related add-ons, an amount that ultimately fell short of Brentford's valuation of the 28-year-old player. Wissa, who scored 19 league goals last season, has reportedly expressed a strong desire to join Newcastle and recently signaled his interest in a move by removing his association with Brentford from his social media profiles.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a groundbreaking "superfood" supplement that could help save honeybee populations from the severe threats of climate change and habitat loss. The new food provides all the essential nutrients bees require, particularly key lipids called sterols that are vital for their development but have historically been very difficult to synthesize. In laboratory trials, bee colonies that were fed the new supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that successfully reached adulthood, offering a major breakthrough for global agriculture.</p>
