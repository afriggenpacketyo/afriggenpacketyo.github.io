          <p>Donald Trump defended his administration's plan to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 as a gift from Qatar to replace Air Force One, calling it a transparent transaction. Critics from both parties have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and violations of gift rules for US presidents, citing the US constitution's prohibition on government officials accepting gifts from foreign states. Trump stated the plane would be a temporary gift to the Defense Department, while Qatar has disputed the reports, calling them inaccurate. The current Air Force One planes have been in service since the 1990s, and Trump has sought to replace them since his first term.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK has announced that it is laying down its arms and disbanding after a 40-year insurgency against Turkey. This move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the organization to dissolve itself. Ocalan, who has been imprisoned since 1999, stated that there is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit of a political system. The decision is seen as a potential step towards a terror-free Turkey, though the specifics of what Ocalan and his supporters will receive in return remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Royal experts suggest Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal stems from adhering to royal protocols and avoiding the rebellious path taken by Princess Diana. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age, Kate was more mature when she married Prince William, allowing her to better navigate the pressures of royal life. While Diana modernized the monarchy by making it more personal, her struggles with press scrutiny and marital problems played out publicly. Kate, on the other hand, has maintained a focus on duty and receives strong support from both the palace and her family.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a fintech app designed to support UK-based immigrant communities in saving money collaboratively through traditional methods like "money circles". The app aims to address the lack of financial services tailored to immigrant communities, who often face discrimination and rely on informal savings systems. Bloom Money allows users to create and participate in rotating savings circles, providing a digital and regulated platform for these practices. Mohanty emphasizes the importance of building wealth within immigrant communities and fighting for a more diverse formal financial system.</p>

The release is part of ongoing mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, reopen crossings, and resume aid delivery. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office acknowledged Hamas's plan, stating that the US has informed Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of other hostages.
