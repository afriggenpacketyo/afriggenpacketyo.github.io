          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking some of President Trump's trade tariffs has a limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, the article states. The tariffs ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While the UK has reached an agreement with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this deal has yet to be implemented. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on goods like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal, creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>

Despite a three-month pause, the United States still imposes a 10 percent baseline "reciprocal" tariff on Japanese products.

          <p>The author reflects on an experience in Prague where a stranger corrected her child's behavior, contrasting it with the more individualistic approach to parenting common in America, the article describes. Historically, child-rearing involved more communal oversight, with neighbors and strangers feeling empowered to correct a child's misbehavior. The author argues that this collective approach can be beneficial, as it reinforces lessons and helps children understand the expectations of polite society. While acknowledging potential drawbacks, the author expresses openness to more direct involvement from others in guiding her children's behavior.</p>
