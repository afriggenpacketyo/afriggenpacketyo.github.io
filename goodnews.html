          <p>Following the death of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan at age 71, the sports world is reflecting on his monumental career that propelled professional wrestling into a global phenomenon. Key moments being remembered include his legendary bodyslam of Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III, which is considered a pinnacle event in WWE history. Other career-defining matches include his "Icon vs. Icon" bout with The Rock and his shocking heel turn to form the New World Order, which reshaped the landscape of wrestling for years.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a "historic" free trade agreement, which is projected to increase their annual bilateral trade by more than $34 billion in the long term. The deal will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including British scotch whisky and automobiles, and Indian textiles and agricultural products. Finalized after three years of negotiations, the pact is seen as a strategic victory for both nations, aiming to boost wages, lower consumer prices, and strengthen economic ties between the world's fifth and sixth largest economies.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 07:01:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a UK-first initiative, the Welsh government will provide people with conditions like coeliac disease with pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining food on prescription from a pharmacy. The move aims to "de-medicalise" the process and give individuals more choice and dignity. While the amount on the cards will vary, advocates hope it will help offset the significantly higher cost of gluten-free products.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are preparing for a pivotal second Test match against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with an opportunity to win the series 2-0. A victory would mark the first time the Lions have gone 2-0 up in a series in 28 years. Despite being strong favorites, the team is focused on avoiding the complacency that appeared late in their first Test victory. The Wallabies are expected to be more aggressive, bolstered by the return of key players like Will Skelton and Rob Valetini.</p>

          <h2>Push to Remove Artificial Dyes from US Foods Gathers Momentum</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A movement to eliminate artificial food dyes in the United States, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is gaining traction, with the dairy industry recently pledging to remove them from ice cream by 2028. Citing health concerns like hyperactivity in children, the initiative follows actions by major food manufacturers and several states. While public health advocates largely support the move, it presents significant challenges for companies, who must find stable, naturally-derived alternatives without alienating consumers accustomed to vibrant, artificially-colored products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a dramatic and historic decrease in its murder rate, which is on track to reach its lowest point since the 1960s. Following a spike in 2020, murders fell by a record 12% in 2023 and are down roughly 20% so far in 2025. Analysts point to a multi-faceted approach, highlighting cities like Baltimore, where federal funding from the American Rescue Plan has been used for community investments and "focused deterrence" programs that offer services to high-risk individuals, potentially contributing to the nationwide trend.</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has ordered Google to pay the equivalent of $12,500 in compensation to a man who was photographed naked in his yard by a Street View camera. The man, a policeman, argued that his dignity was violated when the image, which showed him from behind, was published online, leading to ridicule. An appeals court overturned a lower court's dismissal, ruling that the image was a "blatant" invasion of privacy because he was within his private property, behind a wall over six feet high.</p>

          <p>As skin cancer rates rise, health experts are emphasizing the importance of using sunscreen while also addressing public concerns about the safety of some ingredients. Scientists differentiate between "organic" sunscreens, which use carbon-based molecules to absorb UV light, and "physical" sunscreens with mineral filters like zinc oxide. While some long-approved chemicals have been detected in the bloodstream, researchers stress that the dose is critical and the benefits of preventing sun damage still outweigh the potential risks. They strongly advise against ineffective and untested DIY sunscreen alternatives.</p>

          <p>In response to a severe housing crisis exacerbated by last year's wildfire, a Maui County Council committee has passed a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation aims to convert these units, which are currently in apartment-zoned areas, into long-term housing for local residents by closing a legal loophole. Proponents, including the mayor, see it as a critical step to ensure residents can afford to live on the island. Opponents argue it could harm the local economy and that the converted units may still be unaffordable.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have arrested a 67-year-old man in connection with the murder of Shona Stevens, a case that has remained unsolved for over 30 years. Stevens, a 31-year-old student, was fatally attacked near her home in Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1994, suffering severe head injuries. The arrest marks a major breakthrough in the cold case, which saw renewed public appeals and a significant reward offered by Crimestoppers last year, following decades of persistence from the victim's family in their search for justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable trend in Major League Soccer is the decline of home-field advantage, with the home-win percentage dropping to levels seen in top European leagues. This shift is viewed not as a negative but as a sign of the league's growing maturity and competitive balance. Factors contributing to this include improved travel logistics like charter flights, more consistent refereeing with VAR, and the adoption of more sophisticated, aggressive away-game tactics. The change indicates that results are increasingly determined by sporting merit rather than punishing travel schedules or biased conditions.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago has found that while people may prefer interacting with extroverted robots, they find neurotic robots to be more human-like and relatable. In an experiment where participants interacted with a robot acting as a restaurant greeter, the version programmed with a neurotic personality—displaying tentative speech and anxiety—was often described as being more emotionally understandable. This research challenges the industry's typical focus on creating confident, outgoing robot personalities, suggesting that expressing vulnerability can make artificial intelligence feel more human.</p>

          <p>Even as the theatrical box office struggles to recover and streaming models remain uncertain, dealmaking for movie studios is active, exemplified by the Skydance-Paramount merger and other potential acquisitions. Analysts suggest the value lies not in short-term profits but in the strategic power of intellectual property (IP). Owning vast film and TV libraries provides a key to unlocking long-term revenue through reboots, merchandise, and licensing deals. This makes studios attractive assets for building larger entertainment ecosystems, even in a challenging market.</p>
