          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act for allegedly assisting Iran. The charges stem from conduct between August 2024 and February 2025, and the men were arrested on May 3. Authorities from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command are leading the investigation, describing it as complex and fast-moving. The three men are currently in custody and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the origins of Indigenous Americans to prehistoric migrations from Asia, occurring approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The research, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. The findings suggest that early settlers split into isolated groups, adapting to diverse environments and shaping the unique genetic traits of modern Indigenous communities. The study highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge for understanding the cultural heritage and health of underrepresented Indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for the first round of its presidential election, with voters choosing between left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki. The election's outcome will determine whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can advance its reform plans, which have been hindered by President Andrzej Duda. Tusk's government has struggled to achieve significant domestic progress due to Duda's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court. The election is seen as crucial for the future direction of Poland, with potential implications for its relationship with the EU and its domestic policies.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving discarded shoes a second life by collecting and sorting them for reuse or recycling. The company collects over one million shoes per year from donation boxes across the United States. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries for resale, creating microbusiness opportunities, while shoes that are not suitable for reuse are crushed and repurposed into flooring, mats, and other products. The company aims to provide an environmentally friendly solution for dealing with used sneakers and hopes to inspire other businesses to replicate their model.</p>
