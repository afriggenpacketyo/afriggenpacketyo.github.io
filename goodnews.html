          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has disclosed a stake of over $2 billion in the enterprise software company Workday, expressing support for its management. The investment follows Workday's announcement of a new multi-year plan aimed at boosting shareholder value, which includes a $5 billion share buyback and measures to expand profit margins. Workday has historically underperformed its peers despite strong revenue growth, and this new strategy, coupled with Elliott's involvement, signals a shift from a "growth at all costs" mentality to a focus on profitability and efficiency.

          <p>The recent Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight highlights a major strategic push by Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority and TKO Group (parent of UFC) to dominate professional boxing. Through a new venture called Zuffa Boxing, they aim to create a league-style structure, moving the sport away from its fragmented model reliant on disparate promoters and sanctioning bodies. This initiative, backed by immense Saudi financing, involves promoting massive superfights and developing new talent, raising questions about the future for traditional promoters and the long-term financial implications for fighters under a more centralized, UFC-style system.</p>

The all-butter pound cake, known for its thick cinnamon swirls and sugary coating, has a history of appearing seasonally and then vanishing for long periods. Fans on social media have praised the dessert, calling it "addictive" and sharing creative ways to enjoy it, such as making French toast. The return of the popular bakery item has generated considerable excitement among the retailer's loyal customer base.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of Census Bureau data reveals the U.S. cities where household incomes have grown the fastest between 2023 and 2024, with Tampa, Florida, leading with a 15% increase. The list of top ten cities also includes four from California: Long Beach, San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. While some of these cities, particularly in Silicon Valley, already boast some of the nation's highest median incomes, others like Baltimore saw significant percentage growth but still remain below the national median. The data suggests that large cities experience more economic volatility and potential for significant wage-growth events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African police have dismantled a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg, seizing drugs with an estimated value of $20 million. During the raid, which was initiated after a tip about a strange chemical smell, authorities arrested five North American citizens who were in the country illegally. A South African farm caretaker was also taken into custody, while two other suspects are believed to have escaped. The operation uncovered precursor chemicals, manufacturing equipment, and crystal meth packed in buckets and stored in freezers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has called for the establishment of emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the significant backlog of asylum claims. The proposal aims to speed up application processing and reduce the costly reliance on housing asylum seekers in hotels. Party officials suggest doubling the number of caseworkers to staff these centers, arguing the move would be more humane for applicants and fiscally responsible for taxpayers. The concept is modeled after the temporary Nightingale hospitals that were rapidly set up during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>A retired man named Ed Langevin experienced severe, persistent heartburn and rapid weight loss, which were initially difficult to diagnose.

The condition, which made eating intensely painful, was successfully treated with a minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in the affected artery.

The massive availability of private funding allows these companies to grow rapidly without the immediate need to go public. This trend is also impacting public markets, as companies like Oracle and Microsoft benefit from their substantial contracts and investments in these AI giants. (not investment advice)</p>

Both states will also now legally permit the creation of "memorial diamonds" from the ashes of the deceased.

It also advises financing the car for no more than four years to minimize interest payments. Finally, the rule suggests that total monthly vehicle-related expenses—including the loan payment, insurance, fuel, and maintenance—should not exceed 10% of your monthly income, ensuring the purchase fits within a healthy budget.

Wang argues that while China's approach has led to impressive physical dynamism, it often comes at the expense of individual happiness.
