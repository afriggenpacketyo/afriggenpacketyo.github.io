          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders has responded to comments made by his teammate, Dillon Gabriel, who distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors." While some speculated the remark was aimed at Sanders, Gabriel later clarified he was referring to the media. Sanders stated that he spoke with Gabriel and is unconcerned by others' words, emphasizing that such comments do not affect him or his focus. The situation highlights the quarterback dynamics in Cleveland's crowded roster, where veteran Joe Flacco has been named the regular-season starter.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a six-year agreement to spend more than $10 billion on Google's cloud services, primarily for artificial intelligence infrastructure. This deal represents a significant win for Google Cloud as it competes with larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for major corporate contracts. The partnership comes as Meta heavily invests in its AI capabilities, including its Llama family of models, and requires vast cloud infrastructure to support its portfolio. Despite being competitors in the online advertising market, Meta also utilizes cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft to meet its extensive operational needs.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.1% in July, a decrease from the previous month's 3.3% but still higher than the 3% forecast by economists. The easing was partly attributed to a decline in rice price inflation, which had previously surged. The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also excludes energy prices, remained steady at 3.4%. These figures follow a recent upgrade in the central bank's inflation forecasts and better-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Texas Farmer Finds Profitability by Grazing Sheep on Solar Farms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 20:17:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing significant financial losses from traditional agriculture, has successfully pivoted his business to solar grazing. Instead of planting crops, he now rents out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawn mowers for large-scale solar farms, keeping vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach has proven highly profitable, turning a potential six-figure loss from cotton farming into a substantial profit. The trend reflects a growing challenge for small and mid-sized farms, with many struggling to break even in the face of low prices and unpredictable yields.</p>

Investors are closely watching for any signals that might influence the Fed's decision, with futures markets currently pricing in a high probability of a rate cut at the September policy meeting.

          <p>The UK government has introduced new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and to stop marketing snacks for infants under one year old. The guidance also seeks to restrict health claims that lack scientific evidence. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Health campaigners have welcomed the focus on manufacturers, but some express concern that the voluntary nature of the guidelines may not be sufficient, with potential government action threatened if firms do not comply within 18 months.</p>

Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a rare earnings miss, which was primarily driven by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He believes the company is "hitting it on all cylinders" and has successfully retained the higher-income shoppers it attracted during peak inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing the league's worst team, the Dodgers were unable to extend their narrow division lead and now head to San Diego for a critical series against the Padres with first place on the line. Alex Freeland had a career-best three hits in the win, part of a late-series surge where the Dodgers scored 20 runs.

          <p>A New York appellate court has overturned the nearly $500 million financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, deeming the amount excessive and potentially unconstitutional. While the ruling nullified the massive fine, it upheld the trial court's finding that Trump and his organization were liable for fraud. Other non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state for three years, remain in place. The New York Attorney General's office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>
