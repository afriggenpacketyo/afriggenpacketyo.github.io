          <p>Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit filed against him by the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to a local charity, the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts. The city had sought reimbursement for the costs of investigating Smollett's claims of a hate crime, which police later determined to be a hoax. Smollett's conviction on charges related to staging the incident was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on double jeopardy grounds. The settlement allows all parties to move forward from the six-year-old case, with the city believing it provides a fair and constructive resolution.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the reactions of Black South Africans to President Trump's statements about the persecution of white farmers in South Africa. Many South Africans responded with anger, disbelief, and humor, viewing Trump's claims as insensitive given the country's history of apartheid and the ongoing inequality faced by Black people. The article highlights the contrast between Trump's narrative and the experiences of Black South Africans who have also been victims of crime and violence. It also touches on President Cyril Ramaphosa's attempts to address economic issues during his meeting with Trump, which were overshadowed by Trump's focus on false claims of genocide.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, which includes scaling back Mayor Karen Bass' public safety initiatives in an effort to prevent city worker layoffs. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers, and scales back new hires for the Fire Department. The council voted 12-3 for the plan, with some members expressing concern over the cuts to public safety agencies. The budget also taps into the city's budget stabilization fund and increases parking ticket costs to address a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall.</p>

          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, in international travelers arriving at airports across the U.S. Cases have also been reported in other states, separate from the airport cases. The variant is now dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia, prompting increased masking recommendations and stockpiling of vaccines and antiviral treatments. Researchers suggest the variant may be more transmissible. The FDA's vaccine advisers are considering updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons in response to the variant.</p>
