          <p>Conan O'Brien and Ryan Reynolds humorously commented on Meghan Markle's new lifestyle brand, As Ever, particularly her artisanal jams. The conversation began with Reynolds discussing his father's career as a food broker, leading to jokes about Markle's luxury jams being similar to his father's work. The comedians' ribbing follows criticism of Markle's brand as inauthentic, with some experts noting that her approach lacks the relatability or aspiration that made Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray successful. The article underscores the importance of authenticity and connection in marketing, suggesting that Markle needs to establish a genuine connection with her audience to achieve success in the lifestyle industry.</p>

          <p>Kenton Cool, a British mountain guide, has broken his own record by scaling Mount Everest for the 19th time, marking the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool's climbing career on Everest began in 2004, with only interruptions in 2014 due to an avalanche and in 2015 due to an earthquake, as well as in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The article notes that hundreds of climbers and guides are currently on the mountain during the spring climbing season, aiming to reach the summit before the monsoon season begins. Only Nepali Sherpa guides have surpassed Cool's record, with Kami Rita holding the highest number of climbs at 30.</p>

          <p>This article examines the struggles of small, religiously affiliated colleges in rural areas, which are increasingly facing declining enrollment and financial challenges. Many of these institutions are attempting mergers to survive, as combining resources and streamlining administrations offers a potential solution to financial instability. These colleges often serve low-income, first-generation students who appreciate the personal touch and religious values they offer. The article also notes that some religious colleges are experiencing enrollment gains due to growing political divisions and ideological attacks on secular institutions, with parents seeking a safe place for their children with a biblical worldview. The article also explores how a long decline in the proportion of adults who consider themselves affiliated with a religion appears to have leveled off, the Pew Research Center finds.</p>

          <h2>Simple Brick Stacking Method Could Reduce Air Pollution in Bangladesh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that altering the way bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The traditional method of stacking bricks tightly restricts airflow, leading to inefficient burning and increased emissions. By implementing a zig-zag pattern, airflow increases, leading to more efficient combustion and reduced fuel consumption. The study found that this simple intervention could decrease fuel use by 23% and reduce carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by about 20%, improving both worker conditions and profits for kiln owners. The research team is now working with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training, offering a hopeful solution for a region plagued by severe air pollution.</p>

          <p>A recent internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor right-wing extremist attitudes. While the study offers some relief, it also reveals that a small percentage of soldiers hold chauvinist or xenophobic views. Some researchers are skeptical of the safeguards in place, noting that the survey is voluntary and that the ZMSBw is part of the Bundeswehr itself. Concerns remain about the potential for extremist attitudes to persist, especially with the government's push to increase recruitment and the normalization of right-wing attitudes in wider society.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, offering long-term operating rights to Chinese companies in exchange for construction financing. This model represents a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting this approach. In Kenya, Chinese financiers may contribute 40% of the funds for a railway extension, gaining exclusive rights to construct and operate it for 25 years to recoup their investment through toll fees.</p>
