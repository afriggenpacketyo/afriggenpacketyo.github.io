          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 09:21:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of September 9, 2025, average mortgage rates are 5.76% for 15-year and 6.58% for 30-year loans, while refinance rates stand at 6.01% for 15-year and 6.73% for 30-year terms. Experts suggest rates might stabilize if the Fed pauses hikes, but a strong credit profile and comparing lenders remain crucial for securing favorable terms. Borrowers should also consider loan terms and fees to ensure affordability and lock in rates after making a decision. This article provides a snapshot of the current market and advice for securing good rates.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 09:15:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale prices, measured by the Producer Price Index, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, providing a potential opening for the Federal Reserve to approve an interest rate cut this month. This decline, driven largely by a drop in services prices, defied expectations for a rise and comes amidst a weakening labor market. While inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, officials are increasingly confident in easing price pressures, despite concerns raised by President Trump's tariffs and his public pressure on the Fed. This article suggests a significant shift in the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock soared 28% after analysts expressed shock and praise for its massive growth projections in cloud infrastructure and new AI deals. Despite an earnings and revenue miss, Wall Street focused on the company's forecast of cloud revenue jumping to $18 billion this fiscal year and reaching $144 billion in five years, driven by multibillion-dollar contracts including one with OpenAI. This article highlights the "seismic shift" in computing and Oracle's unique approach to data center property, though some analysts caution that much of the growth comes from competitors offloading capacity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 09:12:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can find affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), with average rates around 8.10% to 8.37% as of September 9, 2025. These rates are significantly lower than other personal borrowing options and are expected to decline further with potential Fed rate cuts. Home equity loans offer fixed rates and lump sums, while HELOCs provide revolving credit with variable rates. Both can offer tax benefits for home improvements, but homeowners must carefully consider their budget and the risk of using their home as collateral.</p>
