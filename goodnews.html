        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A movement of "AI vegans" is emerging, composed of individuals who abstain from using artificial intelligence due to ethical, environmental, and personal wellness concerns. The article draws a parallel to dietary veganism, noting that practitioners are often vocal about their choice to avoid AI, which they argue harms critical thinking and relies on exploitative labor. The technology's significant energy and water consumption is also a major concern for this group. While a complete boycott of AI may be unrealistic for the masses, the concept encourages greater awareness of the technology's hidden costs and societal impact.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China has announced it will waive tuition for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this fall. The policy, which also provides subsidies for children in private kindergartens, is designed to lower education costs and ease the financial burden on families. This move comes as many households grapple with a slowing economy, a weak job market, and a prolonged real estate slump. The central government will share the funding responsibility with local governments, contributing between 50% and 80% of the cost depending on the region's fiscal strength.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 06:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss researchers have created an innovative, ultra-thin material capable of significantly reducing traffic noise, offering a potential solution for urban sound pollution. The mineral foam absorber is just 2.1 inches thick but performs as effectively as much bulkier conventional materials like rock wool. Its multi-layered design forces sound waves through winding paths, dissipating them efficiently, and it can be customized to target specific frequencies. A real-world test in Zurich demonstrated a noise reduction of up to four decibels, a noticeable improvement for residential areas, though scaling up production remains a challenge.</p>

          <p>ESPN has signed a five-year deal to become the new home for WWE's premium live events, including WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, starting in 2026. The agreement is valued at an average of $325 million per year, a significant increase from the previous deal with NBCUniversal's Peacock. All ten annual events will stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with select events also airing on its linear networks. Executives from both companies see the partnership as a strategic move to expand WWE's audience and help ESPN attract a younger, more diverse, and more female viewership.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California system did not provide sufficient legal justification for its policy barring undocumented students from on-campus jobs. The lawsuit, filed by a UCLA alumnus and lecturer, argued the policy is discriminatory and violates state law, forcing students into the underground economy. While the UC system cited risks of violating federal law, the court found this fear was not a proper basis for the policy. The ruling does not mandate the hiring of undocumented students but requires the university to reconsider its stance based on appropriate legal criteria.</p>

          <p>A new social club named Ballers is set to open in the former Macy's building at The Bloc in downtown Los Angeles, transforming the 100,000-square-foot retail space into a sports and entertainment hub. The venue will feature 18 pickleball courts, four padel courts, golf simulators, and soccer pitches, alongside bars, a restaurant, and a wellness area. This project, backed by professional athletes like Andre Agassi and Kim Clijsters, reflects a growing trend of converting traditional retail locations into experiential spaces. Ballers aims to be accessible, with memberships starting at $99 per month and options for non-members to book courts.</p>

          <p>The HBO series 'The Penguin,' a spinoff of 'The Batman,' has earned 24 Emmy nominations by delving into the complex origin story of the iconic villain. Creator Lauren LeFranc and stars Colin Farrell, Cristin Milioti, and Deirdre O’Connell discuss how they explored new, emotionally rich backstories for the characters, which gave them significant creative freedom. The series reimagines Oswald Cobb's rise from nothing, his tortured relationship with his mother, and his conflict with mob scion Sofia Falcone. The actors embraced the deep character work, which they felt was more akin to theater than a typical franchise project.</p>

          <p>An exhibition in San Francisco highlights the influence of architect Bruce Goff, known for designing LACMA’s iconic Japanese Pavilion, and the American School of architecture he fostered. Goff, who chaired the architecture school at the University of Oklahoma, encouraged a radical spirit of freedom and self-expression, breaking from the rigid modernism of his time. Many of his students migrated to California, applying his principles to create unique, context-driven structures that integrated with the landscape. The exhibit showcases the work of these renegade architects, whose visionary designs are now seen as prescient in their approach to sustainability and creativity.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia is leading a renewed diplomatic effort for the international recognition of a Palestinian state, a move some see as a genuine peace initiative and others as a strategic repositioning. The push, which resulted in the "New York Declaration" signed by the Arab League and the EU, outlines a phased path to a two-state solution and calls for Hamas to disarm. Experts note this aligns with Saudi Arabia's long-standing Arab Peace Initiative from 2002 and serves its interest in regional stability, which is crucial for its economic diversification plans. The initiative faces significant opposition from Israel and the U.S., but has gained traction with other Western nations.</p>

This is the second such discovery at the Carola Bridge this year, following a similar incident in January that required 10,000 people to be evacuated.
