          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years and is now predicted to return to Earth. While the exact location of re-entry is unknown, experts calculate it will occur between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. The spacecraft was designed with a heat shield, increasing the likelihood that parts of it will survive re-entry and impact, legally belonging to Russia if recovered.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association (FA) after being sanctioned for comments made to a transgender woman opponent during a match. Vaughan questioned the player's gender and raised safety concerns with the referee, leading to a six-match ban for improper conduct. An FA appeal board later found Vaughan's hearing unfair, quashed the ruling, and dropped the charges after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan states the case has negatively impacted her life, while the FA maintains confidentiality regarding the details.</p>

          <p>Mexico is suing Google for changing the label of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform following an executive order by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argues that the name change affects Mexico's continental shelf and has sent letters to Google urging a revision. Google's policy is to follow local official names, but it uses 'Gulf of America' for U.S. users. The lawsuit follows the House's passage of the Gulf of America Act, aiming to codify Trump's order.</p>

However, uncertainties remain regarding the impact on products processed in the European Union and the overall stability of trade relations.
