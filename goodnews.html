          <p>As Halloween costume prices rise over 11% from the previous year, an Austin, Texas man named Christophe Waggoner is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes. He spends his own money, over $5,000 annually, to purchase items from thrift stores, which he then redesigns into unique costumes at his home. For nine years, he has hosted free events where children can choose a costume, ensuring they can experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their family's financial situation. Waggoner believes this act of kindness encourages a cycle of giving, as many families return to donate costumes for others.</p>

          <p>American mountaineer Jim Morrison has become the first person to successfully ski down the treacherous North Face of Mount Everest, a feat he dedicated to his late partner, Hilaree Nelson. He descended the 29,032-foot summit via the steep and avalanche-prone Hornbein and Japanese Couloirs, a route previously unskied. Morrison described the four-hour descent as a mix of "survival skiing and actual shredding," and expressed that he felt Nelson's presence cheering him on. This historic accomplishment succeeded after two previous attempts were thwarted by permitting issues and dangerous weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies for greater stability. These funds are designed to offer more structural downside protection and provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is relevant as policymakers are expected to cut rates. The manager highlights the growing demand for strategies that provide both income and defense against equity drawdowns, but advises investors to be cautious of unsustainable yields and high fees in newly launched products.

          <h2>Study Finds Men More Likely Than Women to Expedite Relationship Milestones for Financial and Emotional Reasons</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a new study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more likely to rush into moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings was a primary motivator for men to speed up these relationship milestones. Experts suggest that beyond finances, heterosexual men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when they are single. This trend is also observed by relationship coaches, who report more men signing up for their services.</p>

          <p>Repair work has commenced to restore the main power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been reliant on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow the complex repairs to proceed safely. Although the Russian-controlled plant is not in service, a reliable power source is critical for cooling its reactors to prevent a nuclear incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines to the plant have required restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>In a competitive job market, applicants are turning to affordable and fast AI tools to create professional headshots for their LinkedIn profiles and resumes, bypassing expensive photographers. Services like InstaHeadshots and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished images for under $50, which some users claim has significantly increased inbound messages from recruiters. However, this trend has raised concerns among HR professionals about authenticity, as poorly generated or overly stylized photos can be perceived as deceptive. While the technology makes professional imagery more accessible, it creates a new challenge for recruiters in distinguishing between enhanced and genuine applicant photos.</p>

Experts note that Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often face substandard care due to systemic disparities. The group aims to break generational cycles and foster emotional expression, providing a crucial outlet in a community disproportionately affected by systemic racism and trauma.</p>

Greene also stresses the importance of persistence, noting that she applied for over 100 scholarships to win 30 and suggests students should apply for 100 to 200 awards.

Because the all-cash deal does not require a shareholder vote, Starboard's involvement is seen as a constructive effort to restore investor confidence and guide the company through this transition, potentially by seeking board representation, rather than blocking the transaction.
