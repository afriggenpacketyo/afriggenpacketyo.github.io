          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has emphasized the insurer's continued dedication to its net zero climate ambitions, despite political resistance in the US and UK. Blanc linked these environmental goals directly to the company's core business, citing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events like floods and wildfires and the need to ensure properties remain insurable. The company's stance comes as some major US and UK banks have withdrawn from climate alliances, creating a division in the financial sector over green commitments. Aviva also reported a 22% rise in operating profit, boosting its share price.</p>

          <p>Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is reaching out to Latino voters in the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial race with her first Spanish-language radio advertisement. The ad focuses on economic issues, with Spanberger promising to lower costs for families, a key concern for Latino voters who have shown shifting political allegiances in recent elections. The move is seen as a strategic effort to rebuild support within a growing demographic in the state. Her campaign is also contrasting her platform with that of her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, by criticizing Sears's support for Trump administration policies.</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to invent two new potential antibiotics capable of killing drug-resistant superbugs like MRSA and gonorrhea. The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs from scratch, and the resulting compounds proved effective in laboratory and animal tests. While these potential drugs are still years away from clinical use, the breakthrough demonstrates that AI can significantly accelerate the discovery of new medicines. This innovation could mark the beginning of a new era in the fight against antibiotic resistance, which currently causes over a million deaths annually.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of A-Level Results Shows Rise in Top Grades and Widening Regional Disparities</h2>

          <p>An analysis of this year's A-level results reveals that the proportion of top grades (A* or A) has risen slightly to 28.3%, with boys outperforming girls for the first time since 2018. A record number of 18-year-olds secured their first-choice university, with the most selective institutions seeing the largest growth in acceptances. However, the data also highlights a growing regional gap in England, with students in London achieving significantly more top grades than those in the North East. The results reflect a student cohort considered "smaller but stronger" due to the post-pandemic return to tougher grading standards at the GCSE level.</p>

          <p>Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan has broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) in a five-hour flight. His SolarStratos aircraft, a lightweight carbon-fiber plane covered in solar panels, took off from an airport in Switzerland and soared to an altitude where it crossed paths with a commercial airliner. The team sees the achievement as a powerful symbol for the future of decarbonized aviation. The flight data is now being sent to the World Air Sports Federation for official validation of the new record, which surpasses the previous one set 15 years ago.</p>

          <p>A multi-year federal investigation that began with a minor car accident in Tennessee has resulted in the indictment of five leaders of the United Cartels, a major Mexican drug trafficking organization. The initial incident led investigators through wiretaps and surveillance to a large-scale drug ring, culminating in the seizure of 850 kilograms of methamphetamine hidden in a tractor-trailer. The U.S. government is now offering rewards up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of the cartel's top leader, Juan José Farías Álvarez, and his associates. The case illustrates the direct link between violent international cartels and drug distribution in small American towns.</p>

          <p>Residents of Fort Collins, Colorado, have been spotting rabbits with bizarre, horn-like growths on their faces, inspiring nicknames like "demon rabbits." However, wildlife officials have clarified that the animals are not dangerous and are simply infected with the Shope papillomavirus. This relatively common virus causes wart-like tumors that are typically harmless unless they obstruct the rabbit's ability to see or eat. The virus, which cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals, is believed to be the origin of the jackalope myth and played a role in early cancer research.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old student from Glasgow, Rebecca Young, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for inventing a solar-powered warming blanket for homeless people. Rebecca designed the device at a school engineering club, and the concept was later turned into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales. Dozens of the blankets have been distributed to a local charity, Homeless Project Scotland, to provide comfort to those sleeping outdoors. As part of the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also featured as a Lego mini-figure on a digital cover of the magazine.</p>
