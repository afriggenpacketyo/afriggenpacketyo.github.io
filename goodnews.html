          <p>Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda stated that many market participants view continued reductions in government bond purchases as suitable while the central bank normalizes policy. During a mid-May meeting, there were limited requests to revise the current reduction plan through March 2026. The BOJ will discuss the planned purchase reduction at its next policy meeting later this month to gradually shrink its balance sheet. Ueda mentioned that the BOJ will not raise its policy rate unless economic and price conditions are expected to improve, citing uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jodie Marsh, a former glamour model, won a court case against Uttlesford District Council, allowing her to keep lemurs at her private animal sanctuary. The council had refused her application for a wild animal license in July 2024, raising concerns about her taking a meerkat to the pub. However, District Judge Christopher Williams ruled that Marsh is someone who cares for animals. Marsh insisted that she was being targeted by online trolls.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation dropped to a cooler-than-expected 1.9% in May, falling below the European Central Bank's 2% target due to sharp declines in services. Economists had anticipated a 2% reading, while the services inflation print cooled significantly to 3.2%. The latest figures will be considered by the ECB as it prepares to make its next interest rate decision later this week, with markets pricing in a high chance of an interest rate cut. The OECD expects the euro area to expand by 1% in 2025, with inflation projected at 2.2% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investor interest in Chinese makers of fresh drinks is high, but S&P Global Ratings suggests that too much money may be chasing the same growth story amid heated competition. The mainland market for fresh-made beverages is expected to expand by close to 18% annually between 2023 and 2028, potentially reaching 1 trillion yuan in sales by 2027. However, investor confidence has quickly tumbled for beverage chains lacking a clear edge in the fiercely competitive industry. Supply-chain capacity is of paramount importance, with shares in some companies already experiencing significant declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Katherine Hill, 53, has been ordered to repay ¬£50,000 she stole from her two daughters' inheritance, which was left to them by their grandmother. Hill and her father were found guilty of fraud by abuse of power after a trial last year, receiving prison and suspended sentences, respectively. The inheritance was meant to be held in trust for the daughters' 25th birthdays, but Hill and her father falsely claimed to have given the money to them. The judge determined that Hill stole the money because she was resentful that her daughters received more than she did.</p>

          <p>President Trump pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's line. The men had been ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, owning firearms, and international travel due to the felony convictions. Moore and Mansell spotted the longline off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and, believing it was illegal, freed the marine animals and reported it to state wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, claiming the line belonged to a licensed fisherman, but the pardons erase the convictions.</p>

The Old Trafford side struggled to score goals last season, and Mbeumo, who scored 20 times for Brentford in the league, is seen as a valuable addition. While Mbeumo is not a natural number nine, he is viewed as versatile, dynamic, powerful, and fast, aligning with Amorim's preference for flexible players.</p>
