          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump declared that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank, asserting, "It's not going to happen. There's been enough, it's time to stop." This statement follows pressure from far-right Israeli ministers advocating for annexation and comes after Trump's discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and a meeting with Arab and Muslim leaders at the UN. These leaders explicitly warned of the dangers annexation poses to peace in Gaza and the broader region. The article underscores the international community's concern over Israel's ongoing occupation and settlement expansion, which are deemed illegal under international law.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma family visiting Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas made a remarkable discovery, unearthing a nearly 3-carat chocolate brown diamond. Raynae Madison, who found the stone, initially thought it was too large to be a diamond. Park staff identified the 2.79-carat gem, explaining that its brown color is due to plastic deformation during its formation. Named the "William Diamond" after her nephew, it is the third-largest diamond registered at the park this year. The article celebrates this rare find and highlights the park's unique appeal as a place where visitors can actively search for and keep their gemstone discoveries.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, effectively moving the company out of the intense takeover speculation that surrounded it earlier this year. This positive shift is attributed to a comprehensive strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, significant progress in its cost-cutting initiatives, and a series of recent oil discoveries. Equity analysts, like Allen Good of Morningstar, had questioned the initial takeover rumors, even when BP traded at a discount. The article highlights BP's stronger financial performance, including beating analyst expectations in its second quarter, and CEO Murray Auchincloss's optimism about new hydrocarbon finds, signaling renewed confidence in the company's growth trajectory.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 238, an urgency measure providing up to one year of mortgage relief for victims of the devastating January 7th firestorms. This new law enables borrowers to halt mortgage payments for up to 12 months without incurring late fees or penalties, simply by attesting to financial hardship. It also explicitly prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating foreclosures and safeguards borrowers' credit scores. The legislation, co-sponsored by Assemblymembers John Harabedian and Jacqui Irwin, offers more comprehensive support than previous voluntary programs, aiming to significantly ease the financial burden on thousands of homeowners struggling to rebuild.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order formally approving a deal for a consortium of predominantly U.S. investors to take over TikTok's American operations, thereby averting a congressional ban. This agreement stipulates that ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company, will retain less than a 20% stake in the new entity, which will be governed by an American-majority board of directors. Cloud-computing firm Oracle is slated to provide "top to bottom security" by hosting U.S. user data and scrutinizing the app's algorithm. The article emphasizes that this complex arrangement is designed to mitigate national security risks while preserving TikTok's availability for its 170 million American users.</p>
