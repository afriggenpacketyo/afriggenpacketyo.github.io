          <h2>Chinese Biotech Firms Gain Prominence at Global Cancer Conference</h2>

          <p>China's drug development capabilities were prominently featured at the world's largest cancer research conference, with Chinese firms accounting for nearly one-third of presentations. A report by Jefferies highlights that global pharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking to China for innovative and cost-efficient drug candidates. These partnerships typically involve foreign companies acquiring rights to develop and market promising Chinese drugs globally, while the Chinese firms retain rights for their domestic market. The trend underscores a significant shift in the global biotech landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 19:05:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the second year in a row, homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased, with the latest count showing a 4% drop to an estimated 72,308 people. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass highlighted this as a significant turning point, attributing the progress to new city and county initiatives aimed at resolving encampments and providing housing. Despite the positive trend, people of color remain disproportionately affected, and the crisis persists due to a severe lack of affordable housing. Officials caution that the work is far from over but view the results as a sign of momentum.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 19:03:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veteran center Brook Lopez has officially signed a two-year, $18-million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, expressing excitement about the team's potential to win a championship. Lopez, a Southern California native, cited the opportunity to play with stars like Kawhi Leonard and for coach Tyronn Lue as key factors in his decision. He anticipates a productive on-court partnership with current center Ivica Zubac, suggesting their combined size could dominate the paint defensively while his outside shooting complements Zubac's interior game. Lopez will likely transition to a role coming off the bench for the team.</p>

          <p>The West Indies cricket team suffered a historic defeat against Australia, being bowled out for just 27 runs, the second-lowest total ever recorded in a Test match. The stunning collapse on the third day in Jamaica secured a 176-run victory and a 3-0 series sweep for Australia. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for nine runs, including the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history, and surpassing 400 career Test wickets. The result was described as "heartbreaking" by the West Indies captain, highlighting a recurring issue with the team's batting performance.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that the market is entering a new phase of increased deal-making, advising investors to anticipate a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the coming months. He pointed to several recent deals, such as Ferrero's acquisition of WK Kellogg, as early indicators of this trend. Cramer believes that a more favorable regulatory environment under the current administration is encouraging companies to pursue these transactions. He argues that this uptick in M&A activity is a positive sign not just for investment banks but for the overall health of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has become a central topic of conversation at the MLB All-Star Game following his surprise selection to the National League team. The 23-year-old, who has only a month of major league experience, was chosen after a dominant 12-strikeout performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The decision has drawn criticism, particularly from members of the Philadelphia Phillies, who felt their own pitchers were more deserving. Despite the controversy, NL manager Dave Roberts defended the inclusion, stating that Misiorowski's "electric" presence brings excitement and attention to the game.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has notably broken with former President Trump on key issues, has reported a strong fundraising quarter. His campaign announced it has stockpiled over $1.7 million for his re-election bid. This financial strength comes as Trump's political allies have launched a super PAC specifically aimed at unseating Massie in the 2026 primary. Massie's robust fundraising will be crucial in defending his seat against the well-funded challenge, demonstrating his resilience despite facing direct opposition from the former president's powerful political operation.</p>

          <p>The British government has launched a public consultation to determine the future of the state-owned Post Office, floating the idea of transferring ownership to its postmasters. This "mutualisation" plan, which has been discussed for over a decade, is being revisited as part of a broader effort to reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal. The scandal saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for financial discrepancies caused by faulty software. The consultation will also explore what services the Post Office should offer, with a focus on banking, as the government seeks to create a more trusted and stable institution.</p>

          <p>A new report from U.S. News and World Report shows a significant rise for Chinese universities in global academic rankings, with institutions like Tsinghua, Peking, and Zhejiang University making notable gains. The assessment, which focuses on research and reputation, now lists 15 Chinese universities in the top 100, a dramatic increase from just two in 2018. This steady ascent is attributed to decades of sustained government investment in education and the successful recruitment of overseas talent. The article suggests this trend reflects a "brain gain" for China, partly at the expense of the United States.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, widely considered the "world's toughest foot race." The grueling 135-mile course starts in Death Valley and involves extreme heat and significant elevation gain. Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. Having started running marathons at age 60, Becker's achievement serves as an inspiring example of endurance and determination at any age.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dairy industry has voluntarily committed to removing synthetic dyes from ice cream, an announcement praised by Trump administration officials as a major public health step. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that over 40 ice cream companies have agreed to the change, which aligns with the administration's focus on eliminating certain chemicals from food. The move continues a pattern of pursuing voluntary agreements with industries rather than imposing regulations. The FDA also announced the approval of a new plant-based blue dye derived from gardenias, providing a natural alternative for manufacturers.</p>
