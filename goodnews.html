        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record high, continuing a period of significant gains as investors looked past concerns regarding international trade disputes and conflict in the Middle East. The market briefly dipped following news of the U.S. ending trade talks with Canada but quickly recovered, demonstrating strong underlying confidence. Analysts suggest this optimism is fueled by a dialed-back tariff posture in other areas and data indicating a healthy economy, with inflation remaining near its lowest level since 2021. The index has surged over 20% since a low point in April. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has softened its travel advice for Israel, shifting from a warning against all travel to advising against all but essential travel for most of the country. This change follows a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran and the reopening of Israeli airspace, which has increased the availability of commercial flights. The Foreign Office announced that a final evacuation flight for British nationals is scheduled for Sunday, as demand has decreased. Despite the eased restrictions, the government acknowledges the situation remains fragile and will keep its travel guidance under continuous review.</p>

          <p>The new independent film 'Ponyboi' offers a narrative exploration of the intersex experience, written by and starring River Gallo. The movie, which premiered at Sundance, follows an intersex Latine sex worker in New Jersey who dreams of escaping a life of crime and violence. Gallo, a multitalented artist, uses the film to delve into themes of identity, trauma, and the search for freedom, drawing from their own life as a first-generation Salvadoran-American and intersex individual. The film aims to bring visibility to intersex stories, which Gallo notes are often ignored in broader conversations about gender and in anti-trans legislation.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its inclusion in the index, favorable regulatory developments, and new product launches. The cryptocurrency exchange's stock is on track for its best month since November, rallying over 43% in June alone. Analysts attribute the surge to the passage of the GENIUS Act, which provides a federal framework for stablecoins, and the strong market performance of its partner Circle. Despite concerns over declining trading volumes, experts suggest the stock may have further room to grow as institutional interest in the crypto space increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues in favor of new congressional bills aimed at prohibiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing masks or otherwise concealing their identities during operations. The authors contend that such practices undermine public trust, create safety risks by making it difficult to distinguish officers from impostors, and erode law enforcement legitimacy. They assert that transparency and accountability, signified by identifiable uniforms and badges, are fundamental to policing in a democratic society. The piece dismisses ICE's justification of officer safety, stating that masked enforcement is unacceptable and counterproductive.</p>

Processing over $15 billion in daily transactions, they are used for everything from DeFi trading to international remittances in high-inflation economies. However, their growth has raised significant regulatory concerns about financial stability, illicit use, and monetary sovereignty. This has led to a transatlantic split in regulation, with the U.S. promoting a lighter, innovation-focused approach while Europe implements stricter, bank-like rules to control their spread.

The incident garnered international praise and highlighted the gorilla's protective, maternal instincts.
