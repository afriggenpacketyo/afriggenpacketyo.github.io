          <p>Swiss bank UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.4 billion, doubling year-on-year results and surpassing analyst expectations. The strong performance was fueled by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit amid market volatility and a 12% rise in transaction-based income from its wealth management division. The bank is currently contesting a Swiss regulatory proposal for stricter capital requirements, which it argues are "extreme." UBS expects its net interest income to remain broadly stable in the next quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents along the California coast responded to a tsunami advisory, triggered by a major earthquake off Russia, with a blend of curiosity, concern, and nonchalance. In Southern California, where only small waves were expected, many beachgoers and tourists were surprised but not overly worried, while some locals contemplated their lack of emergency plans. In tsunami-prone Crescent City in Northern California, patrons at a local brewery remained calm, accustomed to such alerts. The varied reactions highlight the different levels of preparedness and perceived risk across the state's coastal communities.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje has joined an elite group of rugby players by captaining the British and Irish Lions to a series win in Australia, a feat achieved by only a handful of others. The 30-year-old lock is celebrated not only for his on-field prowess and durability but also for his thoughtful leadership and off-field philanthropy. Itoje, who has played in eight consecutive Lions Tests, emphasizes the unique bond formed among players from four different nations. The team now aims for a 3-0 series whitewash, a historic achievement that would further solidify Itoje's legacy in the sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the FTSE-100 index reaching record highs this year and outperforming many global benchmarks, its success is not necessarily reflective of the domestic UK economy. The index's strength is largely driven by its heavy weighting in defensive and cyclical multinational corporations, such as energy, mining, and defense firms, which derive most of their earnings overseas. This international focus means a weaker pound can boost the index, creating a disconnect from the UK's actual economic health. Historically, the Footsie's composition has shifted from domestically focused companies to globally oriented ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's recent victory over Spain in the Euro 2025 final, securing their second consecutive European title, is seen as a pivotal moment for cementing the legacy of women's football in the country. Following their 2022 win, the sport saw a surge in attendance and investment, and this latest triumph is expected to further that growth. The players, known as the Lionesses, are recognized not only for their on-field success but also for their advocacy for equal access and their role in inspiring the next generation. Despite progress, stakeholders acknowledge that further investment and support are needed, particularly for clubs outside the top flight.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6.13 million settlement with Jewish students and a professor who sued the university over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The lawsuit argued that the university violated their civil rights by allowing protesters to block access to classes and other campus areas. This settlement follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" in creating a hostile environment for Jewish students. As part of the agreement, UCLA must ensure equal campus access for all, with funds allocated for damages, legal fees, and antisemitism-combatting organizations.</p>

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine invertebrate may have practiced a form of "social distancing" to enhance its survival. A 436-million-year-old fossil of the brachiopod species *Nucleospira calypta* revealed that the creatures arranged themselves in a regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the sea floor. The researchers believe the animals used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures, called setae, to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing. This arrangement likely improved their ability to filter feed without competing with each other for resources.</p>

The change came after the country's internet regulator highlighted that many minors reported seeing harmful content on the video-sharing site.

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. This drop brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%-3% target range, strengthening the argument for an interest rate cut. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which partially offset price rises in housing and food. Despite the supportive inflation data, the RBA has held its policy rate steady in recent meetings to confirm the disinflationary trend is sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

Residents are encouraged to consult official tsunami hazard maps to know their evacuation routes and to have an emergency "go bag" ready.
