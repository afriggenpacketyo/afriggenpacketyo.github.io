          <p>Former "Bachelor" stars Sean and Catherine Lowe have voiced their concerns over the widespread use of Ozempic for weight loss, calling the trend "triggering" and "hard to watch." In an interview, the couple promoted what they describe as a healthier approach to wellness, emphasizing consistency, exercise, and healthy recipes through their partnership with Atkins. They argue that sustainable habits, while slower, lead to a healthier long-term lifestyle compared to what they see as a restrictive and potentially risky "easy route." The couple also discussed maintaining their relationship after 11 years of marriage.</p>

The statement follows reports that a temporary placard referencing President Trump's two impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for appearance and presentation, not due to any external pressure. The museum affirmed its responsibility to present complete histories and stated the impeachment section will be updated in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system, a key milestone for the vessel. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV as part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army anniversary appeared to show a successful take-off from the carrier. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for the deployment of heavier and more varied aircraft. The successful drill marks significant progress as the carrier moves closer to its expected entry into service this year.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Shares Calming Phrases for Managing Children's Tantrums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 09:57:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert in conscious parenting, drawing from studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests specific phrases to help de-escalate children's tantrums. The article advises replacing punitive or dismissive reactions with validating and reassuring language, such as saying "I'm right here with you" instead of "Stop crying." The core principle is to view a tantrum as a sign of nervous system distress, not misbehavior, and to connect with the child rather than trying to control them. This approach aims to make the child feel safe and understood, which can reduce the intensity of meltdowns and build long-term emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it is working "at pace" on a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical care, with the aim of launching the scheme within weeks. While the exact number is unclear, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over for free treatment, accompanied by a parent or guardian. This official initiative follows a private effort by the organization Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three children to the UK. The move comes after a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticized the government for previously declining to support such an evacuation.</p>

          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to achieve retirement decades ahead of schedule by adopting a lifestyle of extreme saving and conscious spending. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and the book "Your Money or Your Life," centers on saving a large portion of one's income to build an investment portfolio large enough to live off its returns. Adherents focus on defining what is "enough" for a happy life, thereby liberating their time from the necessity of work for passion projects and family. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry recently stated he does not know his own net worth and prefers to focus on building a portfolio of investments he is proud of rather than fixating on a number. Financial planners say this approach can be beneficial, as it shifts focus from a potentially misleading metric to more tangible goals like cash flow management and values-aligned decisions. Experts suggest that obsessing over net worth can lead to a constant feeling of not having enough. Instead, they advise focusing on understanding daily income and expenses to create a more actionable and rewarding financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's reluctance to release a full cache of documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, several ongoing legal cases could force their disclosure. A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's claim that releasing files would interfere with law enforcement proceedings. Separately, a federal judge has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case against Ghislaine Maxwell could be unsealed. These legal pressures offer a potential path to transparency, independent of the political debate surrounding the Epstein files.</p>

This breakthrough was critical for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after previous materials failed. The development and successful deployment of this "super steel" in the world's first fusion power generation reactor this year places China in a leading position in advanced materials science.</p>

After an earlier plan to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion was blocked by regulators, Figma went public, with its valuation soaring to over $71 billion.
