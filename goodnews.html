          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, remains optimistic about the future of AI and biotechnology despite the ongoing tech war between the U.S. and China.

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete from Southern California, competed in the CIF track-and-field finals, winning first place medals in both high jump and triple jump. The event drew national scrutiny and criticism, including from President Trump, leading to a Title IX investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Following a rule change by the California Interscholastic Federation, a co-winner was named in each of the three events in which Hernandez placed. The event also drew protesters, some holding signs that read "Save Girls Sports," and one person was arrested following an altercation between counterprotesters.
