        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has suggested that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew including Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos' fianc√©e Lauren Sanchez, may have been faked using green screen technology. O'Neal pointed to discrepancies in a video released by Blue Origin, such as the luxurious and unmoved hair of the crew members in space, and a key that appeared to open the landing capsule before Bezos used it. Blue Origin has not yet responded to requests for comment on O'Neal's theory. The mission lasted 10 minutes and 21 seconds, with Perry describing the experience as second only to being a mom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. This migration occurred via the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents when sea levels were lower. The study of fossils, including Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, shows genetic exchanges between horse populations in North America and Eurasia. The research team, consisting of scientists from multiple countries, published their findings in the journal Science.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship, a move that directly contradicts the 14th Amendment. The court is also considering the Justice Department's argument to narrow the scope of 'nationwide injunctions' issued by federal judges, which the administration claims unfairly restricts presidential power. The executive order aims to deny citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents.</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products' requiring additional clinical evaluation. FDA officials are seeking more clinical data before approving the Novavax COVID vaccine. Some experts fear these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines by raising safety doubts and imposing difficult requirements.</p>
