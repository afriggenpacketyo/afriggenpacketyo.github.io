          <p>Prominent Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives has been appointed chairman of Eightco Holdings, a company pivoting its strategy to accumulate Worldcoin (WLD) as its primary treasury asset. The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund the acquisition of the token associated with Sam Altman's biometric identity project. Ives expressed strong belief in Worldcoin's potential as a standard for human authentication in an AI-driven future, distinguishing this move from typical token strategies. This follows a trend of public companies adopting crypto treasury strategies, hoping to mirror the success of firms like MicroStrategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates above 21%, many Americans are facing significant financial strain. This article suggests that generic debt-reduction strategies are often ineffective and advocates for personalized assistance. It outlines three primary avenues for help: credit counseling agencies that offer comprehensive financial analysis and debt management plans, debt relief experts who negotiate directly with creditors to potentially reduce the amount owed, and proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or temporary rate reductions. These tailored approaches can provide a more effective path to financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has denied President Donald Trump's request to overturn the $83.3 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The Second Circuit panel upheld the verdict, rejecting Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should have presidential immunity. The court affirmed that Trump's defamatory statements in 2019 were materially identical to those made in 2022, for which a separate jury had already found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The judges also ruled that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity did not apply to this case, bringing Carroll closer to finalizing the long-fought legal victory.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District is offering a significant financial incentive for Southern California businesses, schools, and public agencies to remove nonfunctional turf. A new rebate program provides $7 per square foot for replacing thirsty lawns with water-efficient landscapes, more than doubling the previous commercial rate. This initiative is designed to prepare major water users for a state law that will prohibit using potable water on non-recreational grass starting in 2027. To qualify, projects must include stormwater retention features and at least three drought-tolerant plants per 100 square feet, aiming to enhance biodiversity and environmental benefits alongside water conservation.</p>

The reports, including an independent review by law firm Latham & Watkins, found no evidence of misrepresentation, improper grantee selection, or misappropriation of funds. The audits were commissioned in response to scrutiny from politicians and some residents who questioned the charity's effectiveness. The findings confirm that aid is reaching affected communities through grants to established local nonprofit organizations, with a comprehensive vetting process in place to ensure proper allocation.</p>

          <p>The father and son who were at the center of a viral confrontation at a Philadelphia Phillies game have spoken out about the incident. Andrew Feltwell caught a home run ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, who was celebrating his birthday, calling it a "super-dad" moment. Shortly after, a woman approached them, aggressively claiming the ball was hers and using inappropriate language, which shocked Feltwell and prompted him to give her the ball to de-escalate the situation. In a positive turn, both the Phillies and the opposing Miami Marlins provided Lincoln with gifts, including a signed bat from the player who hit the home run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in history, totaling $1.787 billion, will be split between two winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. Each winner can choose between a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million before taxes. However, their final take-home amounts will differ significantly due to state tax laws. The Texas winner will benefit from the state having no income tax on lottery winnings, while the Missouri winner will face an additional state tax withholding of at least 4%, potentially costing them over $16 million from the lump sum. This highlights the impact of local tax policies on large lottery prizes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take proactive steps to secure even better loan terms. Experts advise focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher FICO scores directly translate to lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, also reduces risk for lenders and can lead to more favorable terms and the avoidance of private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which often feature lower initial rates and can be refinanced later.

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after the finisher medals distributed to 60,000 participants mistakenly featured an image of the wrong city. The design was intended to show an aerial view of the race route through Newcastle and along the River Tyne. However, the medals instead depicted the nearby city of Sunderland and the River Wear, which have no connection to the event. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company admitted the error, humorously suggesting it made the 2025 medal a unique collector's item. The mistake also appeared on official race T-shirts, adding to the embarrassment for the popular half marathon.</p>
