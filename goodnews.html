        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a tense rivalry game, the Los Angeles Dodgers completed a series sweep of the San Diego Padres with a 5-4 victory, thanks to a dramatic go-ahead home run by Mookie Betts in the eighth inning. The Dodgers initially built a four-run lead but saw it evaporate as their bullpen struggled to contain the Padres' comeback. With the game tied and momentum shifting, Betts delivered a decisive solo blast off closer Robert Suarez, a significant moment for the player amid a season of personal struggles at the plate. The win propelled the Dodgers into sole possession of first place in the National League West.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Green Party is at a strategic crossroads as it holds a leadership election, pitting deputy leader Zack Polanski's combative "eco-populism" against the more traditional, broad-appeal approach of co-candidates Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Polanski advocates for a bolder, anti-elite message to connect with voter anger, aiming to replace Labour as the primary party of the left. In contrast, Ramsay and Chowns argue for continuing the successful local-focused strategy that recently quadrupled the party's parliamentary seats. The contest will determine the party's direction as it seeks to capitalize on recent electoral momentum and growing discontent with mainstream politics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 18:40:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global oil prices slipped in early trading as the market reacted to the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Futures for Brent crude and U.S. West Texas Intermediate both saw a modest drop. The decline is attributed to the perception that the U.S. will not implement further sanctions or measures that could disrupt Moscow's oil exports, as the summit focused on negotiating a peace deal for the Ukraine war rather than escalating economic pressure. This has temporarily eased concerns in the energy market about potential supply constraints from Russia.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell provided a candid, unscripted moment during a preseason game against the New England Patriots by accidentally dropping an F-bomb on live television. While mic'd up for an in-game interview with the broadcast team, O'Connell was reacting to an illegal motion penalty against his team that negated a positive play. His unfiltered exclamation highlighted the intensity of coaching even in a preseason context and served as a humorous example of why NFL coaches are rarely interviewed live while a game is in progress. The moment quickly circulated on social media among football fans.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler won the BMW Championship in Maryland, overcoming a four-shot deficit on the final day. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held the overnight lead, had a difficult start with consecutive bogeys, allowing Scheffler to seize the lead by the seventh hole. Despite some late-round tension, Scheffler secured his victory with a crucial chip-in for birdie on the 17th hole, ultimately finishing two strokes ahead of MacIntyre. The win marks Scheffler's 18th career PGA Tour success and showcases his resilience under pressure.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Jing Qian, a vice-president at the Asia Society, provided an analysis of the recent trade talks between the United States and China.

The discussions are seen as a continuation of core principles established at a previous summit in Geneva, with veteran negotiators from both countries engaging in what were described as tough but necessary conversations. The focus remains on stabilizing economic forecasts and creating breathing space for both nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new JPMorgan Chase analysis reveals that while balances in traditional checking and savings accounts have declined, Americans are increasing their total cash reserves by utilizing higher-yield options. Consumers are moving funds into money market funds, brokerage accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs), which offer better returns in the current economic climate. This strategic shift, observed across all income levels but particularly prominent in lower-income households, may help explain the continued resilience of consumer spending despite persistent inflation and other economic headwinds.

          <p>Manchester United began their season with a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford, with the decisive moment coming from a goalkeeping error. Manager Ruben Amorim's decision to start Altay Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana backfired when Bayindir failed to properly handle a corner kick, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score the only goal of the match. Despite an improved attacking display from United, the mistake has intensified scrutiny on the club's goalkeeping situation. Amorim defended his player post-match, suggesting he was fouled, but the result has already sparked debate among pundits and fans.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel has clarified that a recent comment he made was not directed at his rookie teammate, Shedeur Sanders. During a sideline interview, Gabriel drew a distinction between "entertainers" and "competitors," which led to social media speculation that he was taking a subtle jab at the high-profile Sanders, with whom he is competing for a roster spot. Gabriel later denied this interpretation, stating he was referring to the media as entertainers and that his focus, and that of his teammates, is solely on competing. The two quarterbacks were selected by the Browns in the same draft.</p>
