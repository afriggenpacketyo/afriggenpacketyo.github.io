          <p>A group of students in the UK, on the cusp of receiving their GCSE exam results, have opened letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters, part of a time capsule project initiated by their teacher, capture their anxieties and aspirations during the COVID-19 pandemic, from fears of testing positive to hopes for a post-lockdown world. The exercise provided a poignant moment of reflection for a cohort whose entire secondary education was shaped by the pandemic's disruptions, reminding them of their resilience and their long-held dreams.</p>

          <p>In a decisive victory, 20-year-old British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma stopped veteran Dillian Whyte just 119 seconds into the first round of their fight. Itauma, headlining a card for the first time, showcased his power and precision, sending Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hook. The referee waved off the fight after Whyte managed to get back to his feet, deeming him unfit to continue. This impressive win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0 and solidifies his position as a major rising contender in the heavyweight division.</p>

          <p>Guatemalan authorities successfully secured the release of nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by inmates during a riot in Guatemala City. The riots were initiated by members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs, who were demanding the return of ten of their leaders from solitary confinement at another facility. This incident followed a similar hostage situation earlier in the week where 11 other guards were freed. The events highlight the ongoing power struggles and violence between major gangs within Guatemala's prison system.</p>

          <p>A new music collection, "Sunset Boulevard," documents the final burst of creativity from Elvis Presley between 1972 and 1975, a period marked by personal turmoil and professional disappointment. The set includes his last top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage to Priscilla Presley was ending. The article recounts how Presley's hopes were dashed after losing a potential co-starring role in "A Star Is Born" opposite Barbra Streisand, a setback that friends believe accelerated his decline before his death in 1977, 48 years ago.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its share rising to 31% against Apple's 49% in the second quarter. This shift is partly driven by the growing consumer interest in innovative form factors, particularly Samsung's new line of foldable phones like the Z Fold 7. While Apple still leads, its market dominance is facing a renewed challenge, prompting speculation that Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to compete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City began their Premier League season with a dominant 4-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers, highlighted by an exceptional debut from new midfielder Tijjani Reijnders. The Dutch international contributed both a goal and an assist, becoming only the second City player ever to do so on their first league appearance. Manager Pep Guardiola praised the 27-year-old as a "top signing" who made an immediate impact. Reijnders' all-action performance suggests he will be a key figure for City as they look to rebound from a disappointing previous season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are strongly encouraging adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to help lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. As the risk of heart disease increases with age, dietary choices become critically important. Experts recommend consuming at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>
