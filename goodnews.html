          <p>Wall Street strategists are increasingly optimistic about stocks despite signs of a potential summer slowdown and softening economic data. Several strategists have defended their S&P 500 year-end targets, suggesting that a moderate slowdown is already priced into the market. They point to the fact that stocks and equity market internals tend to move ahead of lagging economic data. Goldman Sachs' analysis indicates that soft economic data, like consumer surveys, typically bottoms out before hard data, supporting the idea that the S&P 500 will follow the upward trend of soft data even if hard data weakens.
