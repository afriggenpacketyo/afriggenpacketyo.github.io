He emphasizes that thorough preparation, including making lists for food, supplies, and safety items like shade tents and hand-washing stations, is crucial. Cooper also advises that the game's kickoff time should dictate the menu, and that food should be easy to handle and eat on the move. Finally, he stresses the importance of cleaning up the tailgate area properly to ensure the tradition can be enjoyed for years to come.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a celebratory bat flip that led to his temporary suspension has been sold at auction for $9,882. The incident gained national attention after Rocco's father successfully took legal action to overturn the suspension, allowing his son to play in the state tournament. All proceeds from the auction, which drew significant interest, will be donated back to the Haddonfield Little League program. The event was even commemorated with a pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo performed their collaborative show, “Sarabande Africaine,” at the Hollywood Bowl, exploring the African origins of the Baroque sarabande dance. The performance fused Bach and Handel with traditional African drumming, Caribbean percussion, and modern arrangements of songs by Gershwin and Philip Glass. Kidjo commanded the stage with vibrant energy, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, foundation. The concert was a celebration of cross-cultural musical connection, demonstrating how diverse traditions can enrich one another.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to $1 billion for the first time in over a year after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This ranks as the sixth-largest jackpot in the game's history, with players facing odds of 1 in 292.2 million to match all six numbers. Winners must choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant federal and state taxes. The immediate federal withholding is 24%, but the final tax bill will be higher as the winnings push the recipient into the top income bracket.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were exposed by receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought plaguing the country for five consecutive years has lowered the water to a point where excavation has become possible in previously submerged areas. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has created an opportunity for researchers to unearth historical sites from the Hellenistic period before they are once again covered by water.</p>

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines the increasingly artificial and paradoxical ways humans interact with the natural world. Nelson traveled to 14 countries to capture images of what he calls "choreographed, hyper-managed, curated versions of nature," such as tourists recreating a scene from "Out of Africa" on a staged safari. His work highlights how zoos, theme parks, and even national parks present a comforting but ultimately false illusion of nature, distracting from the ongoing destruction of genuine ecosystems.</p>
