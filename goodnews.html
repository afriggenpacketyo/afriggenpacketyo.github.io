          <p>A federal judge has extended a block on the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency effort, led by Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction halts further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch during the lawsuit. The judge emphasized that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates and that a president cannot initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, seeking to overturn the injunction.</p>

The New York Times article notes that the court held that the president was likely to prevail in his unitary executive claim, which challenges the constitutionality of independent agencies. The decision, which provoked a dissent by Justice Elena Kagan, suggests a possible reevaluation of the Humphrey's Executor precedent, which limited executive power.
