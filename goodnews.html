Frustrated by the one-dimensional and demeaning portrayals of Chinese people in early Hollywood films, Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do established the studio to create more authentic representations. The studio, which later moved to Shanghai, produced around two dozen films before closing during the Great Depression. The Lee family's legacy continued with the New York Chinese Film Exchange, highlighting their lasting impact on the world of cinema.</p>
