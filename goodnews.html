          <p>Dennis Snyder, along with other Vietnam veterans in Iowa, finally received his high school diploma more than six decades after leaving school to serve in the Navy. Snyder volunteered for service during the Vietnam War before his junior year, missing his chance to graduate from Muscatine High School. He obtained a GED but desired a diploma from his high school, and this year, his dream was realized through Operation Recognition, a program by the Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs. Snyder shared the honor with friends who never returned from the war and expressed his pride in receiving the diploma, seeing it as a recognition of his service.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages through non-invasive means. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. A survey using the test kits detected changes in pre-malignant cells among residents of Hokkaido towns, leading to early detection and treatment of tumors. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine to screen for risks of lung, colon, and pancreas cancer, among others.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. Each phase reflects a unique metabolic state, with specific molecular mechanisms triggering the next phase while suppressing others, similar to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine. This approach highlights the balance between passive and active forces to maintain health and harmony.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, seen as a prelude to the upcoming House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Ishiba navigating a minority government. With no party holding a majority in the assembly, Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party aims to retain its seats despite low cabinet approval ratings. Major parties are using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters, and attention is focused on a new party launched by Shinji Ishimaru. Key issues include support for households grappling with inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke.</p>

The killer, Samuel Woodward, was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

These platforms, both online and offline, aim to provide consumers with a transparent and efficient way to view homes. Cities like Chengdu and Suzhou have launched homebuying platforms featuring numerous projects, with the goal of aligning housing supply and demand and minimizing false promotions. These platforms also offer bundled services such as mortgage applications, tax support, and property registration to improve transaction efficiency.</p>

One example is Huang Yihe, who seeks out remote destinations such as the jungles of Malaysia to find the world's largest rafflesia.</p>
