The article notes Mamdani's "Five Boroughs Against Trump" tour, underscoring his commitment to protecting immigrant communities from federal policies.

          <p>India Walton, a Democratic socialist who won a primary but lost the general election for Buffalo mayor, warns U.S. progressives against moderating their political messages. She argues that compromising on issues like charter schools and police funding cost her crucial support and ultimately contributed to her defeat. Walton believes the Democratic Party has alienated working-class voters by abandoning populist economics. She advocates for bolder progressive stances, drawing lessons from her experience and the recent success of Zohran Mamdani in New York City.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has secured a tentative agreement with its flight attendant union, bringing an end to a strike that disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The deal addresses a key union demand by guaranteeing pay for flight attendants' ground duties. While flights will begin to resume immediately, the airline anticipates that full service restoration may take up to ten days. This resolution follows the union's defiance of earlier return-to-work orders, underscoring broader labor tensions.</p>

          <p>American investors are significantly increasing their stakes in European soccer clubs, especially in England's Premier League, as club valuations and revenues experience rapid growth. U.S. ownership now extends to a majority of Premier League teams, including four of the traditional "Big Six." This trend is fueled by the attractiveness of European soccer as an investment alternative to expensive U.S. sports franchises, alongside the rise of multi-club ownership models. However, European soccer body UEFA is beginning to address regulatory concerns regarding these structures.</p>
