          <p>A recent poll indicates that progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani has widened his lead in the New York City mayoral race, positioning him ahead of established figures like former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams. The Siena poll shows Mamdani with a significant 19-point lead over Cuomo, his closest competitor. As the frontrunner, Mamdani is facing increased scrutiny, particularly regarding his residency in a rent-stabilized apartment, which opponents are using to challenge his credibility on housing affordability. In response, his campaign is focusing on broader Democratic concerns, framing the election as a stand against President Trump.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the potential interest earnings from placing $75,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD) account in the current economic climate. With interest rates remaining relatively high, CDs offer a secure, FDIC-insured investment with fixed returns, protecting savers from potential future rate cuts. The piece breaks down the calculated earnings for various CD terms, ranging from a 3-month CD yielding approximately $793 to a 5-year CD earning over $16,900. It highlights that while rates may decline, locking in a CD now can secure these substantial returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has expanded its employee discount program to include 10% off nearly all grocery items, such as milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. This move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about higher consumer prices, and it extends a benefit previously limited to produce and seasonal food items. The expanded discount, one of the most requested benefits by employees, aims to provide financial relief to its workforce. The initiative could also boost Walmart's sales by encouraging employees to shop in-house and serve as a tool for worker retention.</p>

          <p>A recently passed federal budget bill has expanded the utility of 529 college savings plans, making them a more powerful tool for funding education and career development. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a wider range of qualified expenses. New eligible costs include vocational program fees, required continuing education courses, and expenses related to professional licensing exams. This increased flexibility aims to address concerns from parents that the funds might go unused if a child does not pursue a traditional college degree. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks saw a significant rally as investors grew more confident that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts, possibly as soon as September. The Russell 2000 index gained over 1%, contrasting with a slight decline in the megacap-focused Magnificent 7 Index, suggesting a market rotation. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital for operations and expansion. This optimism is fueled by recent economic data and calls from political and economic figures for monetary policy easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a significant stock drop, Wall Street analysts are adopting a more positive outlook on cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. The initial sell-off was triggered by the announcement of its $25 billion offer to acquire CyberArk, but firms like Deutsche Bank and Piper Sandler have since upgraded the stock. Analysts now argue that the acquisition strategically fills a gap in identity security, enhancing Palo Alto's platformization strategy. They believe the market overreacted to the deal's price tag and misinterpreted it as a sign of weakness in the company's core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has confirmed there are no current plans to play official league matches abroad, stating the idea is "not anywhere near my in-tray." His comments come as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A are seeking permission to stage fixtures in the United States and Australia. The concept of a "39th game" was previously proposed for the Premier League in 2008 but was shelved after backlash from fans. Masters suggested that the league has found other successful ways to grow internationally, diminishing the necessity for such a move.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt relief options. This article discusses the possibility of negotiating directly with creditors, a strategy that avoids fees from professional debt relief companies but requires significant preparation and persistence. Key considerations include understanding debt laws, having a realistic lump-sum settlement offer, and being aware of potential negative impacts on your credit score. The piece advises that while DIY negotiation can be successful, the complexity and potential tax consequences may make professional assistance a worthwhile alternative for some.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced record-breaking container volumes in July, a direct consequence of companies rushing to import goods from China to get ahead of tariff deadlines. Shippers front-loaded their cargo, leading to the busiest month in the port's 117-year history, with import levels reaching an all-time high. However, this early peak has led to a subsequent slowdown, with freight rates from Shanghai dropping significantly since June. The data illustrates the tangible impact of trade policy on supply chains, as importers, particularly in the retail sector, adjust their strategies to mitigate the financial effects of tariffs.</p>
