          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax, which would have affected major U.S. tech companies like Google and Meta. The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was "terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada" in response to the proposed tax. Ottawa stated the move was made to facilitate the resumption of negotiations for a new comprehensive economic and security relationship with the United States. The 3% tax, which was to be collected starting this week, was a point of significant friction between the two allied nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Studies Suggest Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Cause Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Recent studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems, can induce queasiness. Regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, creates low-frequency deceleration that can provoke motion sickness symptoms. Researchers are exploring solutions to mitigate this effect and improve passenger comfort as the automotive industry continues its rapid transition to electric power.</p>

His comments echo those of other top managers who have criticized the relentless schedule and its impact on player welfare. While respecting the competitions, Guardiola acknowledged the lack of adequate rest and preparation time for players participating in the new, month-long summer tournament.</p>

          <p>Beijing has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was first imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The decision to end the restriction follows an agreement reached in May between the two countries to begin the process of resuming trade. While the ban is lifted, the actual resumption of seafood shipments is expected to take a few months as procedural steps are completed, marking a significant de-escalation in this trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust regulator is preparing to fine Harley-Davidson Japan K.K. approximately 200 million yen ($1.4 million) for violating antimonopoly laws. The Japan Fair Trade Commission found that the company pressured its dealers with excessive sales quotas, implying that their contracts might not be renewed if targets were not met. This pressure allegedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to satisfy the quotas. In addition to the fine, the commission will issue a cease and desist order to the Tokyo-based unit of the American motorcycle giant. (not investment advice)</p>

The game was a tribute to Parker, who won championships with both franchises, and her No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters at Crypto.com Arena. On the court, Chicago's Angel Reese dominated with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle down the stretch. Despite a third-quarter surge from Los Angeles, the Sky closed the game strongly, handing the Sparks a disappointing loss on an otherwise celebratory day.</p>
