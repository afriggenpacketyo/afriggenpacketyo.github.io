        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened higher after President Trump signed an executive order to formalize lower tariffs on Japanese auto imports, reducing the rate from 27.5% to 15%. The order also confirmed a significant agreement for $550 billion in Japanese investments into various U.S. projects. Following the announcement, Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable jump, and other regional markets like South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also posted gains. This move positively impacted market sentiment ahead of the U.S. jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tattoos have increasingly entered the mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, reflecting a cultural shift towards greater individuality and self-expression. While many now view tattoos as a legitimate art form, studies show that some social stigma remains, potentially affecting perceptions in professional settings. Research indicates that millennials are significantly more likely to have tattoos than baby boomers, but the practice is prevalent across the political spectrum. Despite their growing popularity, about a quarter of those with tattoos express regret over at least one of them.</p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is observing positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which prohibits student cellphone use during the school day. At Lakeside High School in DeKalb County, teachers report that the ban has created a better learning environment by reducing distractions and increasing student engagement. The principal noted a significant decrease in disciplinary issues since the pilot program was introduced. This local initiative precedes a statewide ban for K-8 schools in Georgia set to begin in 2026, reflecting a growing national trend to regulate phone use in schools.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have committed to providing postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, which could include an international "reassurance force" on land, sea, and air. The statement was made following a Paris summit aimed at solidifying long-term support for Kyiv and clarifying the U.S. position under President Trump. Macron emphasized that these forces would not be on the frontline but would aim to prevent future aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the commitment as a "serious concrete step," while U.S. contributions are expected to be finalized soon.</p>

          <p>The parents of Chloe Childress, a camp counselor who died in a devastating flash flood at Camp Mystic, have successfully pushed for new campground safety legislation in Texas. After discovering the tragedy was preventable, they joined other families in demanding stronger regulations for camps located in flood-prone areas. The two new laws, now awaiting the governor's signature, will prohibit cabins in flood zones, mandate warning systems, and require emergency training. The parents hope these measures will prevent future tragedies and serve as a model for other states to improve camp safety regulations.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for former President Joe Biden has confirmed that he recently underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer. The confirmation came after Biden was seen with a wound on his head in recent photographs. This is not his first encounter with skin cancer; in 2023, he had a basal cell carcinoma lesion removed from his chest. The Mohs procedure is a precise technique that involves removing thin layers of skin until no cancerous tissue remains, aiming to preserve as much healthy tissue as possible.</p>

          <p>An unknown final project by David Bowie, an unfinished musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered among his personal archives donated to the V&A Museum. The notes, found locked in his study after his death in 2016, reveal his fascination with 18th-century London, including its art, satire, and criminal underworld. The musical would have explored themes from the historical periodical of the same name and featured notorious figures like thief Jack Sheppard. This discovery offers new insight into Bowie's lifelong ambition to write for the theater and will be available for public viewing soon.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after his murder conviction was vacated, having spent nearly 27 years incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. His 1998 conviction was based largely on the testimony of a woman who has since confessed to the murder. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release after this key witness and jailhouse informants recanted their original testimonies. A judge found that Hooper's conviction was tainted by false evidence, leading to his exoneration and reunion with his family.</p>

While acknowledging the consumer appeal of browsers that can perform tasks independently, Arora highlighted the conflict with enterprise needs for security and control over access to privileged information.

He emphasized that the move was not personal and was about maximizing the number of high-quality players on the field for the same amount of compensation.

This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as sustained indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.
