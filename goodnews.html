          <p>An astronomical event, a total lunar eclipse, resulted in a "Blood Moon" visible to observers across Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa on Sunday night. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that makes the moon appear red. The reddish color is caused by sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, a process that filters out shorter blue wavelengths and allows longer red wavelengths to reach the moon. The Americas were not positioned to view this particular celestial event.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's manager, Michael O'Neill, conveyed a "real sense of disappointment" following his team's 3-1 defeat to Germany in a recent football match. Despite an admirable effort that saw Isaac Price equalize after an early German goal, Northern Ireland could not hold on. Two quick goals from Germany's Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz in the second half secured the victory for the hosts. O'Neill noted that while he was proud of the performance, the result was disheartening for the squad, highlighting a lack of depth to compete effectively in such a demanding game.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead thriving, particularly in Asia. He argues that the region's economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while the nature of globalisation is shifting to become more regional and fragmented, with Asia at its center, it remains a powerful force. He also cautions that the benefits of interconnectedness are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also a manifestation of a globalized world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to launch a new Defence Industrial Strategy, backed by £250 million in funding, to stimulate regional economic growth and create jobs in the defence sector. The plan includes five new Defence Growth Deals targeting specific regions like Plymouth, South Yorkshire, and Scotland to build on their existing industrial strengths in areas such as marine autonomy and advanced materials. Officials anticipate the strategy could create up to 50,000 new jobs by 2035. The initiative also aims to enhance the UK's ability to respond to global threats by fostering rapid innovation and industrial capacity.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is showing clear signs of economic and social recovery, with tourism and business travel returning to pre-pandemic levels. The city's successful IPO market and ability to host major international events, like a recent Bitcoin conference featuring Eric Trump, demonstrate its unique capitalist status within China. The author contends that despite geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong is benefiting from its "in-between" status and should be nurtured by Beijing as a hub for international institutions. The city's challenge is to balance its integration with mainland China while preserving its distinct international identity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A weather system moving in from the Pacific is set to bring cooler temperatures, thick fog, and possible light showers to much of coastal California this week. Temperatures are expected to be 5 to 15 degrees below normal, providing relief for Southern California after recent heat waves but disappointment for the Bay Area, which has already experienced an unusually cold summer. The forecast is atypical for September, which is usually one of the state's warmest months. While inland areas have seen monsoonal conditions, the coastal regions will experience a distinct cool down before a potential warming trend toward the weekend.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, a significant milestone for the highly-touted 21-year-old. The achievement may intensify the debate around his role in the national team, particularly ahead of the upcoming Ashes Test series in Australia. Despite his undeniable talent and success in shorter formats, Bethell's lack of a century had been a talking point. While some commentators believe he needs more experience in long-form, red-ball cricket, his recent performance and aggressive style could make him a compelling, if risky, choice for the Test squad.</p>

The tour has been noted for the cathartic, communal experience it provides for attendees, with tens of thousands singing along to classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger."

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained amicable during the Italian Grand Prix, even after a controversial team decision. When a pit stop issue caused Piastri to emerge ahead of Norris, who had been leading, the team instructed Piastri to let his teammate back past to restore the original order. Team Principal Andrea Stella defended the decision as consistent with McLaren's principles of fairness, as the position change was due to a team error. The drivers' professional handling of the situation underscores the positive team culture that has propelled McLaren to its current dominant position.</p>
