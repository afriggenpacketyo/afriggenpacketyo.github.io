          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was quelled after officers used gas to force inmates back into their cells, according to the Trousdale County Sheriff's Department. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their assigned housing units, prompting a multi-agency response. Three guards were briefly held hostage but were safely released without major injuries. Sheriff Ray Russell stated that there was no threat of escape, as the prisoners were contained within a yard. The situation was resolved after gas was deployed into the yard, compelling the inmates to return to their cells. The priority was to restore order and ensure the safety of both staff and inmates, preventing any further escalation of the disturbance.</p>

The injured members, part of the 101st explosive ordnance disposal unit, suffered burns, marking the unit's first such incident. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of safely disposing of unexploded bombs, as many remain buried in Okinawa. The Self-Defense Forces conducted numerous disposal operations in fiscal 2023, highlighting the ongoing efforts to clear unexploded ordnance in the region.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly close to appointing Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the departure of Ange Postecoglou. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days, though no official dialogue has been confirmed.

Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, with sources suggesting that Tottenham would need to pay over ¬£10 million to release him from his current contract. The final figure could increase depending on the number of staff Frank brings with him.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will divide into two publicly traded companies, separating its cable networks (CNN, TNT Sports) from its streaming and studios business (HBO Max, Warner Bros. Television). David Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios, while Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks. The split aims to allow each company to pursue investment opportunities and drive shareholder value, effectively reversing the 2022 merger. Cable networks have lost viewers to streaming services, causing a stock slump. Analysts question whether the restructuring will drive growth amid industry shifts towards streaming and declining broadcast viewership. The split is expected to be completed by mid-2026.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf has downplayed a controversy over a social media post criticizing an MP's call for a burka ban, labeling it a 'storm in a teacup.' Yusuf, who initially resigned as chairman before returning to a different role, stated that exhaustion led to his poor decision to criticize MP Sarah Pochin. He now leads the party's Doge unit, inspired by Donald Trump's efficiency initiative, aiming to cut wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils. While personally favoring a ban on face coverings in public, Yusuf emphasized that Pochin's question to the Prime Minister did not reflect party policy. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage acknowledged the issue as a minor setback.</p>

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is urging the European Union to implement "better and simpler regulation" to reform its markets. NBIM argues that European markets have lagged in business dynamism and investment opportunities. The fund recommends unifying capital markets supervision at a European level to address legal uncertainty and operational complexity. NBIM also calls for addressing regional fragmentation in securities law, corporate law, insolvency, and tax regimes, and standardizing pan-European debt issuance processes. NBIM held 285 billion euros in securities issued by EU member states and European corporates at the end of 2024. (not investment advice)</p>
