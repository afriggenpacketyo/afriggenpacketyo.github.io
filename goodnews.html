          <p>The family of Kansas State Wildcats quarterback Avery Johnson issued a public apology following a physical altercation that occurred after the team's loss to Iowa State in Dublin, Ireland. A video circulated on social media appeared to show Johnson’s father and brother involved in a fistfight with other fans outside the stadium, part of the Aer Lingus College Football Classic. The family statement acknowledged that "senseless bickering escalated into an unnecessary fight" and expressed deep regret to Kansas State University, its alumni, and fans. They affirmed that differences have been resolved, taking full responsibility for the incident and committing to ensure it doesn't happen again, while Avery Johnson had a strong game despite the loss.</p>

          <p>An Ohio builder successfully constructed a highly functional 19-square-foot tiny house for just $5,000, demonstrating creative small-space living in his front yard. The compact dwelling, built on an old utility trailer, includes essential amenities like an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed in a vaulted loft, a storage bench, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower system. Everything, including the mini-fridge, is powered by rooftop solar panels, with an option for outlet charging. The builder aimed to prove that a livable space could be created with minimal square footage, even testing its resilience during a snowstorm and camping with his son. While not for full-time occupancy by his family, the project showcases efficient design and the potential for off-grid living, inspiring others to embrace minimalism.</p>

          <p>Defending champions New Zealand, the Black Ferns, initiated their quest for a record-extending seventh Women's Rugby World Cup title with a dominant 54-8 victory over Spain at York Community Stadium. Despite facing a resilient Spanish side that limited their first-half lead, the Black Ferns intensified their play after the break, securing five additional tries. Notably, they managed to score even while playing with 13 women due to injuries. Flanker Jorja Miller, the World Sevens player of the year, delivered an impressive World Cup debut, scoring two dazzling tries and showcasing her immense potential in the sport. This comprehensive win signals a strong start for the defending champions.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the open Atlantic Ocean, southeast of Bermuda, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. As of Sunday morning, Fernand was located about 295 miles east-southeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour, moving north-northeast at 15 mph. Forecasters predict the storm will remain over open waters, strengthening possibly into a hurricane by Monday before weakening on Tuesday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had forecast an above-normal hurricane season this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which became a Category 5 storm earlier in August, though neither made landfall.</p>

          <p>Everton secured a 2-0 victory against Brighton in their first Premier League match at the magnificent new Hill Dickinson Stadium, marking a historic day for the club after 133 years at Goodison Park. Jack Grealish, on loan from Manchester City, delivered a standout performance, contributing two assists and showcasing renewed freedom and effectiveness in his play, earning a standing ovation. This impressive display is seen as a significant step for Grealish, who seeks to reignite his England career ahead of the World Cup, having felt marginalized at City. Manager David Moyes praised Grealish's quality and the team's effort, expressing optimism for Everton's future in their new home after years of financial and footballing struggle.</p>

Her performance, supported by new coach Francisco Roig, signifies a significant mental hurdle overcome and a confident return to Flushing Meadows, where she is now approaching the world's top 30 rankings.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a sentencing bill next month, proposing significant changes including new powers for courts to impose pub and travel bans on convicted criminals receiving community sentences. These restrictions, which could extend beyond specific offenses, aim to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding. The legislation will also incorporate recommendations for restricting short prison sentences and implementing an early release scheme for well-behaved inmates, inspired by US supermax prisons. While Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood ruled out early release for serious offenders, critics express concerns about funding, implementation challenges for hospitality, and increased pressure on probation services and police forces, despite planned recruitment and funding boosts.</p>

          <p>Prageeta Sharma's new poem, "Irresistible Contentment," delves into the poet's introspective journey to find the essence of her art beyond external influences and her "skirted body." The verses explore themes of speech, silence, and the transformative power of internal feelings over lesser ones, seeking a "poem's hearted center" to guide her. Sharma describes a process where morning's magic can appear opaque until a stronger emotion leads her towards a "plateau of nested changes." This evocative piece, from her latest book "Onement Won," reflects on the pursuit of an irresistible truth within her creative expression, aiming for a renewed sense of "golden silence" and a deeper understanding of her own alphabet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to biographer Michael Wolff, former US President Donald Trump had "confrontations" with the Secret Service over his bedroom habits during his first administration. Wolff revealed on a new podcast episode that Trump had a lock installed on his bedroom door, which the Secret Service "demanded it be taken off" due to security protocols requiring their armed guards to have easier access for safety reasons. This wasn't the first public mention of this particular habit, as a 2019 biography also detailed his request for a door lock. Additionally, Wolff mentioned a separate, unexplained incident where Trump reacted strongly to White House domestic staff changing his bedsheets, adding to the anecdotes about his unique preferences.</p>
