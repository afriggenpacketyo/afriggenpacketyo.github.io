          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, following rising tensions since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. The agreement was announced by President Trump and confirmed by officials from both countries, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio commending the leaders for choosing the path of peace. The ceasefire comes after several days of cross-border fire and strikes, with both sides reporting civilian casualties and accusations of troop movements and misinformation campaigns. Tensions escalated after an attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants, leading to retaliatory strikes.</p>

It emphasizes the importance of staying invested in good stocks for long-term gains, rather than trying to time the market. A 'risk-off' environment is characterized by investor fear and a shift towards safer assets like bonds and defensive sectors, while a 'risk-on' environment reflects optimism and a willingness to invest in higher-risk assets like tech stocks. Jim Cramer cautions against making investment decisions solely based on the risk-on or risk-off mindset.</p>
