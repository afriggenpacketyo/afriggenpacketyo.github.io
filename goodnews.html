          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which will impose a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the United States. The deal also includes a higher 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing circumvention of trade barriers, particularly by China. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets for its own products. This agreement comes shortly before a planned expiration of a pause on many of the administration's other global "reciprocal tariffs," which had subjected Vietnamese goods to a 46% rate.

          <p>A new expedition is planned for this fall to investigate a possible location of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft in the Pacific Ocean. The effort, led by the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute, will focus on a "visual anomaly" identified in imagery of a lagoon at Nikumaroro, a remote island. A team will travel in November to determine if the object is Earhart's Lockheed 10-E Electra, which disappeared 88 years ago. If confirmed, a full excavation will be planned for the following year, potentially solving one of the 20th century's greatest mysteries and fulfilling Earhart's wish to return the plane to Purdue University.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has mandated a "robust and independent" new investigation into MI5 after it was revealed the security service provided false evidence to multiple courts. The ruling came after two previous internal inquiries were deemed "seriously deficient" by a panel of senior judges. The case originated from a BBC investigation which proved MI5 had lied about its relationship with a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused women. The judges commended the BBC for exposing the issue and stated that the new inquiry, to be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, is necessary before considering contempt of court proceedings against individuals.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully sequenced the first whole ancient Egyptian genome, revealing details about the life and ancestry of a potter who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The man's well-preserved remains, found buried in a ceramic pot, allowed for the oldest DNA analysis from Egypt to date. The study determined he had brown hair and eyes, lived into his 60s, and had a physically demanding life consistent with pottery work. His DNA showed that while 80% of his ancestry was from North Africa, 20% traced back to the Fertile Crescent, providing the first genetic evidence of population mixing in the region during that era.</p>

The discussions, which also addressed China's relationship with Russia and trade tensions with the EU, were intended to set the stage for an upcoming leaders' summit.

          <p>With U.S. auto insurance costs having risen by 51% over the past three years due to inflation and other factors, drivers are seeking ways to reduce their premiums without sacrificing essential security. This article outlines several strategies for achieving savings, including maximizing all available discounts, such as those for anti-theft devices or paperless billing. Other effective methods involve bundling auto policies with home or renters insurance, and raising the policy's deductible, which can lower premiums by 15% to 40%. Drivers can also review and potentially drop optional collision and comprehensive coverage on older, less valuable vehicles to further control expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A domestic Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was delayed for two hours after a snake was discovered in the aircraft's cargo hold as passengers were boarding. A professional snake catcher was called to the scene to handle the stowaway. Although the 2-foot serpent was ultimately identified as a harmless green tree snake, the catcher initially treated it as potentially dangerous, given that Australia is home to many of the world's most venomous species. The snake is believed to have boarded in a passenger's luggage on the flight from Brisbane and will now be rehomed with a licensed keeper.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts believes the team's "best baseball is still ahead," pointing to the potential for improvement as players like Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman are expected to return to form.

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, has struck down the state's 1849 law that banned nearly all abortions. The court's liberal majority ruled that the historic ban was superseded by a more recent 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. The 1849 ban had been dormant since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision but was argued to be back in effect after Roe was overturned in 2022. This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers, who had resumed services after a lower court's decision in 2023, and solidifies the legality of abortion access in the state for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as a potential supplier of drones and their components to diversify away from China, which dominates the global market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by Western security concerns over Chinese technology and Beijing's ties to Russia. While a complete decoupling from China is unrealistic, Germany is focused on sourcing critical, high-risk components like software and chips from "non-red" supply chains. Taiwan is positioning itself to fill this need, though challenges remain, including scaling its production and navigating Germany's cost-focused procurement laws.</p>

The princess described the post-treatment period as a "life-changing experience" and a "rollercoaster," emphasizing the need to find a "new normal" and acknowledging that recovery is not a smooth, linear process. Her comments resonated with patients who described the experience as discombobulating and a complete change in reality.</p>
