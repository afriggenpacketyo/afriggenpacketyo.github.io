          <p>Aviation company Joby and defense contractor L3Harris have announced a partnership to create a new military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The vehicle will be based on Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology but will use a gas turbine for military applications, unlike Joby's commercial electric models. The collaboration aims to address evolving battlefield needs for smaller, more adaptable, and potentially autonomous aircraft for roles like surveillance and logistics, with operational demonstrations expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>After seven years at Vox's Future Perfect section, a founding editor is leaving his role to start a new project, prompting a reflection on his work's real-world impact. He expresses pride in covering critical topics like pandemic prevention and global aid programs before they were mainstream, but also a sense of frustration that this foresight did not prevent negative outcomes like the COVID-19 pandemic or recent cuts to aid. Despite the grim state of the world and challenges in journalism, he remains hopeful, emphasizing that reporting on important, under-covered stories is more necessary than ever.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that the "Happy Gilmore" movies, including the new sequel, are more than just comedies, conveying a traditional conservative message about the importance of family. The author notes that in both films, the protagonist, Happy, is motivated to play golf not for personal glory but for the well-being of his family—first his grandmother and now his daughter. By placing the interests of older and younger generations above his own, the character embodies an altruistic worldview centered on familial obligation, a message reinforced by Adam Sandler casting his own family in the sequel.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old Swedish striker, Alexander Isak. Reports suggest Liverpool's bid was around £110 million plus add-ons, which is below Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million. Isak, who wants to explore a move away from the club, has been training alone while his future remains uncertain. It is unclear if Liverpool, which has already spent heavily this summer, will return with an improved offer for the player.</p>

          <p>Labubu dolls, small monster-like collectibles from Chinese toy retailer Pop Mart, have become a global phenomenon, fueled by social media unboxings and celebrity endorsements. The dolls, sold in "blind boxes" that add to the thrill of collecting, have seen their popularity soar, leading to rapid sell-outs, rising prices, and a growing resale market. For avid collectors, acquiring the dolls has become a form of "social currency," creating a sense of community and insider status, even as the company struggles to manage demand and combat bots.</p>

          <p>China is doubling down on its strategy to stimulate economic growth by issuing another round of consumer subsidies, bringing the year's total to the 300 billion yuan target. The funds, set to be distributed in October, are part of a broader trade-in program designed to encourage household spending on items like new energy vehicles. This policy reflects a growing reliance on consumption as a primary driver for China's economy, as national retail sales showed a 5% year-on-year increase in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>Startup Trunk Tools is using generative AI to tackle inefficiency and waste in the construction industry, which has historically been slow to digitize. The platform processes millions of unstructured documents like blueprints and schedules, using AI to clarify conflicting information, pinpoint risks, and automate tedious tasks. By improving accuracy and reducing errors that lead to rework, the technology aims to save time, cut costs, and lessen the environmental impact of construction, a sector that loses nearly $1 trillion annually to lost productivity.</p>

          <p>On the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, The Atlantic's podcast "Floodlines" returns to New Orleans for a special follow-up episode titled "Rebirth." The episode reconnects with Le-Ann Williams, who was 14 when the levees broke, exploring the triumphs and tragedies her family has faced in the years since the original series. It examines how the trauma of the disaster continues to affect survivors and shape the lives of the next generation, who are growing up in a city still grappling with the storm's legacy of displacement and inequality.</p>

          <p>A new memoir, "Mailman: My Wild Ride Delivering the Mail in Appalachia," chronicles the author's year as a rural mail carrier in Virginia after losing his corporate job during the pandemic. The book is a multifaceted look at the dignity of blue-collar work, the surprising efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service, and the cultural decline of "service" as an American ideal. The author, a self-aware "interloper," provides an empathetic ethnography of his co-workers and the community, ultimately arguing that the real distinction in American life is not between white- and blue-collar work, but between work and service.</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, has survived over a century of the city's booms and busts by staying true to its Arts and Crafts principles. While Detroit became the heart of mass production, Pewabic focused on handcrafted tiles and vessels, developing unique, iridescent glazes that became its signature. Now operating as a nonprofit, the studio continues to use historic equipment and techniques, finding renewed success as consumers rediscover the value of handmade goods in an age of automation and AI.</p>

          <p>Chevron reported a 44% decline in second-quarter net income, falling to $2.49 billion due to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation.

The oil major achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with its U.S. output growing 8%, and it expects the recently finalized Hess deal to begin boosting earnings in the fourth quarter.

          <p>China has implemented new anti-money-laundering regulations targeting the precious metals and gems sector, a common channel for illicit financial flows. Under the new rules, dealers must report any cash transactions totaling 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) or more to the central bank's financial crime watchdog. This is the first time China has expanded such supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector, aiming to plug a significant loophole used for laundering money.</p>
