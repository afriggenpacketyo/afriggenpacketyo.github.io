          <p>Former Alabama football coach Nick Saban shared an anecdote about the team's 2018 White House visit during a commencement speech at the University of Alabama. Saban recalled how former Alabama linebacker Rashaan Evans pushed the red button on a box on President Trump's desk after being encouraged to do so, resulting in a lady bringing in a Coke on a tray. Saban expressed his gratitude to Trump for choosing the university for his commencement address and making time to speak to the graduates, highlighting Trump's graciousness as a host and the first president to invite the team back to the Oval Office. The speech preceded the school's official commencement ceremonies, which commenced the following day.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from a sharp sell-off in April, fueled by optimism regarding potential trade negotiations. The S&P 500 is nearing levels seen before President Trump's tariff announcements triggered market turmoil. Despite this recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its mid-February peak and has fallen since Trump's inauguration, with concerns lingering about the long-term impact of tariffs on economic growth, as many imports now face increased taxes, and volatility on Wall Street continues to be driven by concerns about the economic fallout from the Trump administration‚Äôs policies. The article indicates that even the prospect of talks has been enough to ease the worst of the anxiety that gripped investors a month ago (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Temu, known for ultra-discounted items shipped directly from China, has altered its business model in the U.S. due to the expiration of the de minimis rule, which allowed duty-free entry for items under $800. The company has shifted to displaying products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses and is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. This change comes as the Trump administration's new rules on low-value shipments and tariffs on China take effect, forcing Temu to raise prices and suspend its aggressive online advertising campaign. The shift is part of the company's efforts to improve service levels, and Temu advertises that local products have ‚Äúno import charges‚Äù and ‚Äúno extra charges upon delivery.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Fuerza Regida, a multiplatinum corrido group, has released their ninth studio album, ‚Äú111XPANTIA,‚Äù which explores themes of manifestation and Mexican heritage. The album, recorded in San Bernardino, marks a return to their original corrido style after their previous album explored electronic genres. The title itself combines the palindrome ‚Äú111,‚Äù considered an angel number, with ‚Äúixpantia,‚Äù the Nahuatl word for manifestation. The band has taken a low-key approach to the album's rollout, with the exception of the lead single, ‚ÄúPor Esos Ojos,‚Äù which was performed at Paris Fashion Week.</p>

          <p>Despite occasional public criticism, the relationship between President Trump and Fox News remains a stable, symbiotic partnership driven by mutual need. Trump may criticize Fox News' polling numbers or individual employees, but the network provides him with a platform for friendly interviews and helps set the news agenda. Fox News, in turn, benefits from the attention and access that come with being a favored media outlet of the president. The network will continue to play its part, as seen with its upbeat coverage of Trump's presidency, resembling a campaign ad.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing. The stake would be worth about $4.8 billion at the current price. The disclosure follows Amazon's first-quarter earnings report late Thursday. The results show that Amazon is bracing for uncertainty related to President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs. The company landed in the crosshairs of the White House this week over a report that Amazon planned to show shoppers the cost of the tariffs.</p>
