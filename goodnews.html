        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid soaring housing prices, which have increased by 56% since early 2020, a growing number of Americans are co-buying homes with friends or relatives. This trend, particularly popular among younger generations like Millennials and Gen Z, allows buyers to pool their financial resources to overcome significant affordability challenges. While co-buying offers a solution to the housing crisis, especially for single individuals, it also presents unique legal and financial complexities that require careful planning. Experts advise creating formal written agreements to navigate potential future disagreements or changes in circumstances.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has described China as being "nanoseconds behind" the United States in the competitive field of semiconductor technology. He advocated for allowing American tech companies to compete globally, including in China, to maximize U.S. economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang highlighted China's vibrant, entrepreneurial tech industry, its deep talent pool, and its internal drive as reasons why the U.S. must actively compete rather than rely solely on restrictions. He expressed a belief that it is in China's best interest to remain open to foreign investment and competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an optional electronic identity card system. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data protection concerns and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan addresses these issues by ensuring the system is publicly managed and that data is stored on users' smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy erosion and data tracking, despite the new safeguards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare regulation known as the "envelope rule" could be implemented on the final day of the Ryder Cup following a neck injury to European player Viktor Hovland. This rule requires each team captain to secretly designate one player in a sealed envelope before the final day's singles matches. If a player from the opposing team withdraws due to injury or illness, the player named in the envelope also sits out, and the match is declared a half-point tie. The rule ensures that a last-minute withdrawal does not unfairly penalize one team.</p>

          <p>The British government is underwriting a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support the company and its vast supply chain following a debilitating cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has forced a complete halt in production, costing the automaker at least £50 million per week and threatening the solvency of smaller suppliers. This government intervention, intended to protect thousands of jobs, is believed to be the first of its kind in response to a cyberattack. The loan aims to provide financial stability as JLR works to recover its systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland, are participating in a referendum to decide on a proposal that would severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to a three-month period from October to December. Proponents of the ban cite concerns over noise and air pollution, as well as harm to microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents argue the restrictions are an example of an excessive "culture of prohibition" that would create unnecessary difficulties for residents and maintenance workers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The broader plan involves 12 potential locations that could collectively deliver 300,000 new homes over the coming decades, with a requirement that at least 40% be classified as affordable housing. The initiative aims to replicate the post-war housing boom led by a previous Labour government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently benefit the Middle East, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, in the global competition for tech talent. As Gulf nations invest billions to become global AI hubs, they are creating a business-friendly environment with incentives like long-term "golden visas" and reduced regulations. Investors suggest that the combination of high compensation packages, a tax-friendly environment, and large-scale innovative projects makes the region increasingly attractive. This trend could see the Gulf outpace other regions in attracting skilled professionals who may be deterred by stricter U.S. immigration policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has been struggling to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season. The club brought in a specialist set-piece coach, Martin Mark, from Danish club Midtjylland to improve their effectiveness in this area. While there has been a noticeable shift in strategy, such as an increase in long throws, the results have not yet materialized consistently. This article analyzes the team's approach and challenges ahead of their match against Arsenal, a team that has been highly successful with its own set-piece plays.</p>

          <p>In response to recent comments from the Trump administration about autism, this opinion article highlights the positive traits often associated with autistic people. The author argues that qualities like an intense capacity for focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of empathy and social justice, and exceptional memory stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump's public persona. The piece refutes the framing of autism as a tragedy needing a "cure," instead celebrating the unique perspectives and profound joy that autistic individuals can experience and share. It emphasizes that what truly makes us human is the capacity for love.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking steps to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by erecting a new monument commemorating the 1885 massacre of Chinese coal miners. The attack, where a mob of European migrant miners killed 28 Chinese workers and burned their neighborhood, is one of the deadliest incidents of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history. The new, more prominent statue aims to shed light on this past, moving beyond a previously small and overlooked plaque. This commemoration occurs as archaeologists excavate the site of the original Chinatown, uncovering artifacts from the event.</p>
