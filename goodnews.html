          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by the largest daily inflow into Bitcoin ETFs this year. The rally, which also saw Ether climb back above $3,000, was intensified by significant short liquidations totaling over $650 million. Analysts attribute the momentum to institutional investment and speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve policy, with expectations that upcoming crypto legislation and corporate buying will continue to support the price. The market remains sensitive to macroeconomic factors, but the current trend reflects strong investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an investigation that revealed minimal oversight and questionable spending, Texas is overhauling its Thriving Texas Families program, which funds alternatives to abortion. The program, with a budget growing to $100 million annually, will now require contractors like crisis pregnancy centers to document all expenses and seek reimbursement for actual costs rather than receiving flat-rate payments. This change aims to prevent misuse of taxpayer funds, such as organizations profiting from distributing free donated items or financing real estate deals, and to increase transparency about the services provided. Critics, however, argue the reforms don't address broader gaps in the state's social safety net.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has publicly expressed his support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), stating the agency performs an important function for the country. He described calls from within his own party to abolish ICE as "inappropriate and outrageous," a stance that drew praise from several Republican senators, including Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. While supporting the agency's law enforcement role, Fetterman also reiterated his support for providing amnesty to law-abiding migrant workers, advocating for a dual approach of deporting criminals while recognizing the economic contributions of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is piloting "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant step for artificial intelligence adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling tedious tasks, with plans to scale from hundreds to potentially thousands of AI agents. This move to "agentic AI" signifies a shift from AI assistants to programs that can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently. The initiative is expected to significantly boost productivity but also raises concerns about the future of human jobs in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially enter the Indian market with the launch of an "Experience Center" in Mumbai on July 15. This move marks the electric vehicle giant's first official showroom in the country and is expected to coincide with the start of direct sales to Indian customers. The launch follows discussions between CEO Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though Tesla will face challenges, including high import duties and competition from established players like BYD and Tata Motors. India has offered lower tariffs for companies that commit to local manufacturing, but reports suggest Tesla is not currently interested in building a factory there.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new robot designed to fully automate the process of cotton topping, a crucial step in improving crop yields. Currently in pilot testing in Xinjiang, the machine uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and vaporize the plant's top bud with a high-powered laser, a task described as "hitting a moving target with a moving gun." The development team from Xinjiang University reports the robot achieves nearly 99% accuracy in bud detection with minimal damage to the plants. This innovation promises to address long-standing issues of inefficiency and inaccuracy in manual cotton topping.</p>

          <p>IMAX is on track for its best year ever, with CEO Rich Gelfond forecasting a record $1.2 billion at the global box office, a significant increase from the previous year. The company's success is fueled by a consumer shift towards premium movie-going experiences and a strong slate of films shot with IMAX cameras, such as "F1: The Movie," which earned over 20% of its total gross from IMAX screens. As studios increasingly partner with IMAX for extended releases, the company is solidifying its market share and expanding its global footprint with new theater contracts and successful local-language film screenings.

Wilga was discovered by a member of the public on a forest trail in a "fragile" state but without serious injuries, a day after her abandoned van was spotted by a police helicopter in the vast Karroun Hill Nature Reserve. Police believe her van became stuck in mud, prompting her to venture into the "hostile environment" on foot.

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which may be the oldest comet ever detected, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object from beyond our solar system to be observed. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated from the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of water ice. As it approaches the sun later this year, it is expected to heat up and create a glowing tail, potentially becoming visible from Earth with amateur telescopes.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees has updated its forecast for the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), raising its intermediate estimate to 2.7% from 2.2% last year. This annual adjustment, which helps benefits keep pace with inflation, is officially calculated in October based on third-quarter inflation data. The trustees' revised forecast reflects that inflation has remained more persistent than previously expected, aligning more closely with other analyst predictions that place the 2026 COLA between 2.4% and 3%. The final figure will be crucial for retirees managing their budgets against rising living costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The NAIA and later USA Wrestling approved the modified uniforms, allowing the sisters to compete and win national championships.
