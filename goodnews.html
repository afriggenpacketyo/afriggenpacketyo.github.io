          <p>The White House has launched an official TikTok account, posting its first video just weeks before President Trump's deadline for the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban. The account's debut video, a montage of Mr. Trump, quickly garnered significant views. This development unfolds amidst persistent national security concerns from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who fear ByteDance could be compelled to share U.S. user data with the Chinese government or manipulate the app's algorithm to advance China's foreign policy goals. Despite TikTok's repeated denials, the app's future in the U.S. remains uncertain as the current extension for a sale expires on September 17, with no clear indication of another extension.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city commissioners have approved the demolition of six buildings at North Hollywood's Valley Plaza, declaring the long-neglected site a public nuisance. Once a vibrant 1950s commercial hub that even hosted John F. Kennedy, the plaza has deteriorated into a source of blight, squatters, and crime, burdening emergency services. Neighbors expressed relief, citing concerns over decrepit conditions and safety, including the recent discovery of an unresponsive individual on the property. While the demolition won't solve broader retail challenges, local leaders hope it paves the way for new development, including potential residential housing and retail, transforming a "once-blossoming" area into a renewed investment opportunity for the community.</p>

          <p>China is marking the 80th anniversary of its victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression with commemorative exhibitions and films, aiming to remind its people of the destruction, brutality, and enormous sacrifices of the 1930s and 40s. Critics overseas accuse these commemorations of inciting hatred against Japan. However, the article argues China's remembrance is about truth and reflection, not vengeance or dictating current feelings. The author, who grew up influenced by Japanese popular culture like Sailor Moon and Detective Conan, suggests that condemning past aggression can coexist with an appreciation for modern Japan, highlighting a nuanced perspective on historical memory and contemporary relations.</p>

          <p>An Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, 22, faces federal charges for allegedly orchestrating multiple large-scale cyberattacks using his "Rapper Bot" botnet since at least 2021. Prosecutors describe "Rapper Bot" as one of the most sophisticated DDoS-for-hire networks, capable of sending 2-3 terabits per second of data to overload targets. Law enforcement successfully halted the attacks on August 6, executing a search warrant at Foltz's home and obtaining administrative control of his botnet. The network controlled approximately 65,000 to 95,000 infected devices across more than 80 countries, targeting a U.S. government network, a social media platform, and U.S. tech companies. Foltz is charged with aiding and abetting computer intrusions, facing up to 10 years in prison, in a case part of the international Operation PowerOFF.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated mixed doubles pairing of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz was defeated by Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper in the revamped US Open mixed doubles, despite creating a party-like atmosphere. Pegula and Draper, the top seeds, advanced to the semi-finals with two dominant wins, showcasing strong teamwork and aggression. The new format, offering large financial incentives and moved ahead of the singles draws, aims to attract stars but has drawn criticism from doubles specialists who feel sidelined. Draper's strong performance was particularly notable given his recent injury, suggesting he is fit and ready for the singles competition, while Pegula's experience provides a strong foundation for their team's success.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose 3% after the retailer maintained its full-year forecast, despite slightly missing Wall Street's Q2 earnings and revenue expectations for the second straight quarter. The company reiterated its projection for 2.8% total sales growth and 1% comparable sales increase for the fiscal year. While acknowledging a "deferral mindset" from homeowners due to general economic uncertainty, Home Depot saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improved monthly comparable sales trends. The company's strategy includes expanding its professional customer base through acquisitions, aiming to weather a sluggish real estate market and high borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>'Abundance Liberalism' Faces Resistance Within Democratic Party</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 16:49:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new political vision, "abundance liberalism," is gaining traction among Democratic elites, advocating for streamlined policies to build clean energy, infrastructure, and affordable housing by cutting bureaucratic red tape. Popularized by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, this approach seeks to overhaul decades-old liberal practices, aiming to inspire voters and counter the current low approval ratings for Democrats. However, the article suggests that the politics of abundance can be treacherous, even among Democrats. While some progressives like Zohran Mamdani have acknowledged it, the high-powered Maryland suburbs outside Washington indicate that this approach faces internal resistance and challenges within the party, highlighting potential ideological divides on how to achieve progressive goals.</p>

          <p>As France experiences another heatwave, a debate over air conditioning use is intensifying across the country. The article highlights the political implications and societal discussions surrounding the technology, as demand for cooling solutions rises. While air conditioning provides much-needed relief from increasingly frequent and intense temperatures, its environmental impact and energy consumption are growing concerns, posing a dilemma for policymakers and citizens alike. The recurring heatwaves underscore the urgency of addressing climate adaptation strategies and balancing immediate comfort with long-term sustainability goals. This discussion reflects a broader European challenge as countries grapple with extreme weather events and the infrastructure needed to cope, while also striving to meet climate objectives.</p>

          <h2>China's BYD Registers as Car Manufacturer in Argentina, Hinting at Local Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 16:43:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has registered a local unit as a car manufacturer in Argentina, a move that strongly hints at plans to begin vehicle production in South America's third-largest auto market. The filing, registered with the country’s Justice Ministry, authorizes BYD Auto Argentina SAU to import, sell, manufacture, and maintain vehicles, batteries, and auto parts, covering the entire EV supply and service chain. This development follows BYD's earlier announcement to expand regionally into Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. If BYD proceeds with such a plan, Argentina would host the company's second vehicle factory in Latin America, after its large-scale project in Brazil, significantly solidifying its presence in the region.</p>
