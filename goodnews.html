        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin reached a new record high, trading above $113,000 and continuing a rally from the previous day. The surge is attributed to a broader investor appetite for risk assets and a significant volume of short position liquidations, which exceeded $318 million in 24 hours. This price increase, fueled by both institutional buying and ETF inflows, has also lifted other cryptocurrencies, with altcoins like Ether and Dogecoin seeing notable gains. The momentum follows a period of stable trading above the $100,000 mark for over two months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a state visit to London, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled several key agreements. The centerpiece is a "one in, one out" pilot program for returning migrants who arrive in small boats to France, in exchange for the UK accepting an equal number of asylum seekers with family ties. The leaders also committed to ordering more Storm Shadow missiles for Ukraine and establishing a new European-led military headquarters in Paris. Additionally, Macron advocated for a joint recognition of a Palestinian state to promote peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>To mark its third anniversary, NASA released stunning new images from the James Webb Space Telescope showing active star formation in the Cat's Paw Nebula. The telescope's Near-Infrared Camera peered through gas and dust to capture young, yellow stars carving out their environment. The images also reveal glowing red areas where star formation is underway and dense filaments of dust that could collapse to form new stars. Since its launch, the telescope has provided groundbreaking insights, including evidence that the universe evolved faster than previously believed.</p>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers using Certificates of Deposit (CDs) should be more strategic. This article warns against three key errors: assuming CD rates will only drop after official Fed action, as banks often adjust rates preemptively; prioritizing high short-term rates over locking in a solid long-term rate that protects against future cuts; and failing to calculate potential earnings and penalties before committing funds. Proactive planning is crucial to maximize returns in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Strong revenue from premium cabin sales and its American Express partnership helped offset a drop in main cabin revenue, indicating a reliance on higher-spending travelers.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With prices for summer travel soaring, there are several strategies to keep costs down for a holiday abroad. Experts advise booking trips for July and August as early as possible and flying mid-week on early morning flights, which are typically cheaper. For accommodation, last-minute deals can be found on package holidays, and house-swapping presents a low-cost alternative. When spending abroad, paying in the local currency on a card is usually more economical than exchanging cash at the airport. Finally, weighing luggage and pre-ordering toiletries for airport pickup can help avoid extra fees.</p>

          <p>The new film “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir, offers a bracing look at a white family's life in 1980s Zimbabwe-Rhodesia during a civil war. Directed by Embeth Davidtz, the story is told through the eyes of 7-year-old Bobo (Lexi Venter), who navigates a childhood filled with racial tension, political uncertainty, and casual violence. The film powerfully contrasts the child's naive perspective with the harsh realities of the era, exploring themes of colonialism and entitlement. The review praises the film's unflinching tone and the astonishing lead performance by the young Venter.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain How Annuities Can Strategically Supplement Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to complement and enhance Social Security benefits for retirees. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow an individual to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, thereby maximizing their monthly government payout. This strategy creates a reliable "paycheck" that covers essential expenses and fills income gaps left by Social Security alone. Furthermore, certain types of annuities can offer tax advantages, potentially reducing the taxable portion of one's Social Security income and helping manage overall financial risk in retirement.

          <p>The MLB will use this year's All-Star Game in Atlanta to test its Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System, a step toward potential regular-season implementation. Each team will receive two challenges per game, which can be initiated by the pitcher, catcher, or batter to review a ball or strike call. The Hawk-Eye tracking system will then display the pitch's trajectory on the scoreboard for a final ruling. While human umpires have improved their accuracy significantly, the system aims to eliminate the remaining missed calls and could be considered for the 2026 season.</p>

The evening was marked by the notable absence of music director Gustavo Dudamel, whose summer appearances are limited, partly due to a travel ban affecting his Venezuelan orchestra. The review notes that while the concert featured a powerful performance from pianist Kirill Gerstein, it felt somewhat subdued. The prevalence of Russian music in the season's programming is highlighted as particularly relevant amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's determined, unbeaten 99 has put England in a stable position at 251-4 at the close of a challenging first day of the third Test against India at Lord's.

England was in precarious positions at 44-2 and later 172-4, but Root's steady presence and key partnerships held the innings together. Root will resume on the second day just one run short of what would be his 37th Test hundred.</p>
