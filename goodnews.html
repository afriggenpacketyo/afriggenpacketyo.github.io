          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in a challenging four-set encounter at the US Open, advancing to the fourth round with a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 score. The 38-year-old Serb, who struggled with a lower back injury during the match, made history as the oldest man to reach the tournament's last 16 since 1991, tying Roger Federer for most Grand Slam fourth-round appearances. Despite his physical struggles and recent absence from the tour, Djokovic's dominant serving, including 18 aces, proved crucial. This hard-fought victory boosts his confidence as he aims for a record 25th major title.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat belonging to 12-year-old Marco Rocco, whose viral bat flip led to a controversial suspension later lifted by a judge, was successfully auctioned for nearly $10,000. All proceeds from the sale of the signed bat are designated for the Haddonfield Little League program, which Marco's father stated his son was happy to support. The incident, which saw Marco ejected and suspended, sparked a legal battle and drew widespread attention, including support from major league players.

          <p>Edinburgh's MacLean brothers, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan, have achieved a new world record for the fastest full, unassisted, non-stop row across the Pacific Ocean, completing their arduous 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia in 139 days, five hours, and 52 minutes. Aboard their boat, Rose Emily, they navigated through violent tropical storms, with one incident seeing Lachlan swept overboard before being rescued. Their remarkable endurance and teamwork allowed them to overcome significant challenges, including rationing food in the final weeks. Beyond their athletic triumph, the brothers have raised over £700,000 for clean water initiatives in Madagascar, combining adventure with a philanthropic mission.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile scenic section of Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022-2023 caused slope failures and collapsed pavement, with further destruction from the Bridge fire in September 2024. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is significant for hikers, providing access to popular trails and potentially reducing overcrowding. However, it coincides with "extreme fire danger" warnings for Angeles National Forest, raising concerns about public safety during the holiday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, attracting substantial interest from both domestic retail and global investors seeking more attractive investment opportunities. Analysts, including Jian Shi Cortesi from GAM Investments, project a sustained upward trend, driven by Chinese investors reallocating capital from low-yielding fixed-income products and the government's strategic push for technological innovation. Cortesi specifically points to "undervalued innovation" within sectors such as advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence. This renewed optimism follows two consecutive months of foreign capital inflows and the Shanghai Composite Index reaching a 10-year peak, indicating a potential turnaround from years of market underperformance.

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's efforts to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans residing and working in the United States. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, concluding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the statutory authority to revoke a previous TPS extension. The court underscored Congress's intent for the TPS program to be predictable and shielded from political influence, providing beneficiaries with essential stability. This ruling represents a substantial legal victory for plaintiffs challenging the administration's immigration policies, although the precise impact on Venezuelans whose protections have already lapsed is yet to be fully determined.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B's testimony in a Los Angeles civil trial, where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, has gone viral due to her animated responses and a lawyer's questions about her appearance. Cardi B denied cutting Emani Ellis's cheek with a fingernail or spitting on her, claiming Ellis invaded her privacy by filming and revealing her then-secret pregnancy. The trial saw moments of levity, including the lawyer's confusion over her wigs and fake nails, which some social media users deemed potentially racist or misogynistic. The case, attracting significant public attention, is expected to conclude next week.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking mentoring program is successfully pairing anxious teenagers with toddlers from local nurseries, aiming to significantly improve school attendance and engagement among the older students. Siena, a 13-year-old who previously struggled with severe anxiety, credits the scheme with more than doubling her school attendance and substantially boosting her communication and confidence. The Power2 charity, operating this initiative in London and Manchester, highlights that assigning responsibility for younger children in a structured environment positively impacts teenagers' learning and self-esteem. The program's carefully considered pairings foster accountability, with reported improvements in learning attitudes for 78% of participants and enhanced self-esteem for 83%.</p>
