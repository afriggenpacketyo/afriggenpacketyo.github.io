          <p>Polish tennis star Iga Swiatek had a testy exchange with a reporter following her U.S. Open quarterfinal loss to Amanda Anisimova. When asked if she needed a "mental break" after a demanding season, Swiatek retorted by questioning the reporter's own need for a break and suggesting they address the schedule makers. This interaction underscored her frustration and competitive drive, as a second U.S. Open title continues to elude her despite a strong season including a Wimbledon win.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that France's sexual consent laws are inadequate, finding against authorities in a case where a woman accused her boss of coercing her into an abusive sado-masochistic relationship. An appeals court had previously cleared the man, citing a signed contract as proof of consent. The ECHR stated that any commitment to sexual relations can be revoked at any time, ordering the French state to pay the plaintiff 20,000 euros in damages. This landmark decision is expected to prompt France to revise its criminal statutes to better protect against non-consensual sexual acts.</p>

          <h2>The Ubiquitous Peace Sign: A New Generation's Go-To Photo Pose</h2>

          <p>The peace sign, or V-sign, has become the ubiquitous photo pose for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, evolving from its historical meanings of victory and anti-war protest. This cultural phenomenon is partly attributed to the influence of Japanese pop culture, particularly anime, where characters frequently use the gesture in both celebratory and casual contexts. For today's children, the gesture often carries no specific meaning beyond being a "cute" pose, offering a convenient way to interact with the camera. This trend reflects how kids, extensively photographed, adopt aesthetic strategies in a visually-driven culture.</p>

          <p>A second man has been arrested in connection with the "disgusting" racist abuse directed at England footballer Jess Carter on social media during the UEFA Women's Euros in July. Derbyshire Constabulary arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of making malicious communications, following a similar arrest of a 59-year-old last week. Carter, who previously stepped back from social media due to the targeting, has been commended by police for assisting the investigation. This action underscores ongoing efforts by the UK Football Policing Unit and social media companies to combat online racism.</p>

          <p>British luxury fashion house Burberry is slated to re-enter the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index later this month, marking its return after a year's absence. This upgrade reflects the brand's regaining traction under CEO Joshua Schulman's comprehensive overhaul strategy. Burberry's share price had significantly declined, but recent first-quarter sales showed a better-than-feared decline, driven by an uptick in U.S. and European markets. The company's focus on classic pieces and cost-cutting measures, aiming for £80 million in annualized savings, signals positive momentum for its financial performance and market standing.

          <p>During a military parade in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were overheard on a hot mic discussing life-prolonging organ transplants and the prospect of human immortality. Putin reportedly quoted a Tang dynasty poem about living past 70, while Xi mused about living to 150 in this century due to biotechnology. Putin later confirmed the exchange, mentioning modern medical means and organ replacement as ways to extend active life.

          <p>U.S. flight attendants are intensifying their campaign for boarding pay, inspired by a recent tentative deal between Air Canada and its cabin crews that includes ground pay. Historically, many North American flight attendants are unpaid until the aircraft doors close. The Air Canada strike, which secured ground pay at 50-70% of hourly rates, is seen as a new standard that will pressure other airlines. Unions like the AFA-CWA, representing 55,000 flight attendants, argue for fair compensation for all hours worked, highlighting that many struggle to earn a living wage despite long duty days.</p>

          <p>An article delves into Taylor Swift's immense success, particularly her perceived "relatability," arguing that this concept both underplays her artistic achievement and insulates her from critique. Drawing on Stephanie Burt's book "Taylor’s Version," the article discusses Swift's songwriting acumen, work ethic, and ability to connect with young women by framing personal dramas in universal terms. It posits that Swift's greatest legacy is overhauling pop music into a vital, contemporary storytelling medium, saturating catchy tunes with narrative depth.

          <p>A fisher, a member of the weasel family, has been discovered in Ohio after being considered extirpated from the region for nearly 200 years. While the specific animal found was tragically killed by a car, it was pregnant, confirming the species is breeding in the state. This marks a significant sign of promise for the animal's comeback, with over 40 sightings recorded since 2013. The return of fishers, alongside other wildlife like bald eagles and wild turkeys, contributes to biodiversity, though concerns exist regarding potential conflicts with local livestock.</p>
