          <p>Journalism, the 8-5 favorite, won the 150th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course after finishing second in the Kentucky Derby. Overcoming a challenging track dried by recent rain, Journalism surged from behind to defeat Gosger, Sandman, and Goal Oriented. Jockey Umberto Rispoli, the first Italian jockey to win a Triple Crown race, celebrated his first victory in the series, while trainer Michael McCarthy secured his second Preakness win. Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty did not compete, ending hopes for a Triple Crown this year, but a Journalism-Sovereignty rematch is anticipated at the Belmont Stakes. This year marks the final Preakness at the historic Pimlico before its reconstruction.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen responded to President Trump's recent attacks during a concert in Manchester, England, reaffirming his criticism of the administration's policies. Springsteen addressed the audience with a resolute speech, highlighting concerns about the erosion of American democracy and the persecution of individuals exercising their right to free speech. He specifically cited the defunding of American universities, the rollback of civil rights legislation, and the abandonment of the world's poorest children. Despite Trump's apparent threat, Springsteen concluded with a message of hope, emphasizing the enduring greatness of America and its people, and referencing James Baldwin's belief in the inherent humanity of the world.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, highlighting the constitutional right to challenge removals. This decision follows several cases where courts have insisted on due process, even as the administration considers measures like suspending habeas corpus. The courts' stance underscores the fundamental principle that all individuals, regardless of citizenship, are entitled to due process before being deprived of liberty, a principle that legal scholars worry is being undermined.</p>

          <p>China is investing heavily in the digitalization of its museums and cultural heritage sites to engage new generations and promote national pride. This initiative includes projects like the digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo at Dafo Temple, which uses advanced technology to bring history to life. Despite economic challenges, Beijing continues to prioritize cultural initiatives to strengthen its soft power and build a "cultural superpower." This push contrasts with Western countries, such as the United States, where funding for cultural heritage and museums is being cut. China's efforts are seen as a way to preserve history, promote technological progress, and enhance its global influence.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. He emphasized that this scheme would not equate to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, criticized the potential scheme as "free movement through the back door." An agreement is expected at the upcoming UK-EU summit, though details regarding age eligibility and number caps are still under negotiation. Starmer stated that a strengthened partnership with the EU would benefit jobs, bills, and borders.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a three-eyed predator that lived over 500 million years ago during the Cambrian period. The creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," possessed a unique circular mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws extending from its head. The discovery reveals that Mosura had a more complex body structure than previously known for radiodonts, including a multi-segmented abdomen-like region with gills. This find provides new insights into the diversity of animal life before the Cambrian explosion, highlighting the rapid evolution occurring at that time.</p>
