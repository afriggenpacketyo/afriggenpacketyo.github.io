          <p>Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers featured an intense brawl during Florida's dominant victory.

Despite the physicality, the Panthers showcased strong offensive play, securing a 6-1 win and a 2-1 series lead. Brad Marchand achieved a historic milestone, and the Panthers' overall performance underscored their momentum heading into Game 4.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund indicates a global decline in fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 individuals across 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their ideal number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a primary barrier, with the highest response in South Korea and the lowest in Sweden. This report marks the UN agency's strongest statement yet on the issue of declining fertility rates, emphasizing the crisis of individuals being unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a catalyst for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment's importance for clean energy. However, critics argue the government is understating the project's cost and that the funds could be better spent elsewhere. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review, with Sizewell C expected to take at least a decade to complete. The funding decision underscores the government's commitment to nuclear power as a key component of its energy strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the CDC reveals a significant reduction in drug overdose deaths among young Americans, particularly those in Gen Z. Fatal overdoses among people under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl on the streets, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. While the trend is promising, challenges remain for individuals struggling with severe addiction, and concerns persist about potential funding cuts for addiction services. The reduction in fatalities represents a positive shift in the fight against the fentanyl crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

The Smithsonian's move comes amid proposed budget cuts and increasing pressure from the Trump administration to reshape federal cultural institutions.
