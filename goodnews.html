          <p>Sly Stone, the frontman of Sly and the Family Stone, has died at the age of 82 after battling lung disease. Stone helped redefine pop, funk, and rock music in the late 1960s and 70s, creating a unique sound that blended psychedelic rock, soul, jazz, and gospel. The band, known for hits like "Everyday People" and "Dance to the Music," was groundbreaking for its inclusion of both Black and white musicians, as well as women instrumentalists, which was rare for the time.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. The split, expected by mid-2026, will separate streaming and studios from legacy cable networks, including TNT Sports. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups, suggesting TNT Sports could be licensed to other entities. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the future CEO of Global Networks, will decide how to monetize TNT's streaming and digital sports rights, including potential mergers or licensing deals. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. The lawsuit stemmed from sexual harassment allegations Lively made against Baldoni during the making of the movie *It Ends With Us*, which were detailed in a New York Times article. Judge Liman ruled that Baldoni failed to show actual malice was involved in Lively's allegations and that the Times reported what it believed to have happened after reviewing available evidence. Lively's lawyers hailed the opinion as a complete victory.</p>
