          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports to the U.S., including a reduction in auto tariffs. President Trump touted the deal as potentially the "largest Deal ever made," claiming it would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The agreement is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, potentially strengthening his leadership amid domestic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kendrick Lamar and SZA's "Grand National" tour received high praise for its London performance, successfully blending their distinct musical styles into a cohesive stadium show. The concert, part of the biggest co-headlining tour in history, focused on their extensive catalogs, largely forgoing gimmicks for powerful individual and joint performances. Lamar's set was noted for its intensity, particularly during his Drake diss tracks, while SZA's performance was lauded for its creative production and strong vocal delivery, connecting effectively with the audience.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement lowers U.S. tariffs on imported Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, providing a major relief for Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy. The positive market reaction reflects investor optimism after a period of uncertainty, as recent data had shown a sharp decline in Japanese auto exports to the U.S. under the previous higher tariff structure.
