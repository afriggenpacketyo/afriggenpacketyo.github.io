          <p>Shares of major steel stocks, including Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics, and Nucor, experienced a surge after President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel imports, increasing them from 25% to 50%. The move, announced at a rally in Pennsylvania, aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States. Cleveland-Cliffs saw the most significant increase, with shares jumping roughly 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor each increased by more than 10%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw a gain of 1.9%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times and fewer delays. The changes, the largest redesign since the 1950s, aim to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impact. While changes to airspace over London are not expected until the 2030s, some changes to routes outside London could be implemented sooner. Some residents are concerned about new flight paths potentially increasing noise pollution, while aviation industry leaders have expressed support for the modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>Nearly six decades after the first human landing on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are once again focusing on lunar missions, with the moon seen as a gateway to Mars. Programs like NASA's Artemis and the joint China-Russia International Lunar Research Station aim to establish permanent bases for scientific research and resource extraction. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources such as iron, silicon, hydrogen, and helium-3, which could be used for self-sufficiency in lunar bases and as fuel for future Mars missions. Furthermore, technologies developed for lunar exploration could have significant benefits for life on Earth.</p>

          <p>A restaurant consultant shares tips on proper dining etiquette, advising customers to avoid "one-timing" servers by requesting multiple items separately. He suggests explaining to the server if you are in a hurry and need to order quickly. When trying to get the server's attention, eye contact and a wave are preferred over snapping fingers. If a meal is incorrect, customers should approach the situation calmly, understanding that errors can occur in the kitchen. It's courteous to place your first order shortly after being seated, and to be mindful of the time spent at the table after the meal is finished.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the role of anti-feminism in South Korea's upcoming presidential election, highlighting how opposition to women‚Äôs rights has fueled authoritarian movements in other countries. It notes that while South Korea has advanced economically, gender equality has lagged behind. The rise of the feminist movement in response to violent crime against women has inspired right-wing forces to champion the cause of disgruntled men. The article suggests that the preservation of South Korean democracy depends on addressing real problems, such as the cost-of-living and urban-housing crises.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the debate among Democrats regarding messaging strategies, specifically whether to focus on policy or populism. A recent poll suggests that voters prefer a populist message emphasizing the power of corporations over an abundance-focused message. The author argues that the political case for ‚Äúabundance‚Äù policies rests on their real-world effects, not their rhetorical appeal. They also contend that Democrats do not need to choose between abundance liberalism and populism, as there is no inherent tension between the two.</p>

He stated that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened," and that emotions can run high. Verstappen's penalty leaves him 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri.</p>
