          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power during the January 6, 2021, certification of the 2020 election results. Pence defied pressure from President Trump to overturn the election results, which he based on false claims of fraud. The award recognizes Pence's decision to resist those calls, even as the Capitol was stormed by Trump's supporters. After leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>
