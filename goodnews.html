          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $750,000 annuity, emphasizing that the exact amount depends on factors like age, gender, and whether it's a single or joint life annuity. It provides a breakdown of estimated monthly payments for different age groups (60, 65, 70, 75, and 80) and genders, based on data from Annuity.org. The article also discusses the benefits and trade-offs of annuities, noting their guaranteed income and predictability but also the potential drawbacks of limited liquidity and tax implications. It concludes that while annuities can provide financial security, they should be considered as part of a broader retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Donald Trump's commitment to Ukraine's defense appears to waver, Europe is demonstrating a growing confidence in its ability to support Ukraine. While Europe possesses the necessary financial resources and artillery, replacing key U.S. capabilities such as operational intelligence and air defense systems would present a significant challenge. The article highlights the shift in European sentiment towards taking a more proactive role in ensuring Ukraine's security. This increasing sense of responsibility comes at a critical time for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as German authorities worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation faced delays due to a resident's refusal to evacuate, but eventually proceeded with the removal of two 200-pound bombs and one 100-pound bomb, all of US origin. The evacuated area included the old part of the city, numerous hotels, bridges, the town hall, and care homes, but excluded the Cologne Cathedral. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne, which was heavily targeted during WWII, including a major British Royal Air Force raid in 1942.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, including both employee and company contributions, recently reached a record high of 14.3% during the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employees deferred a milestone 9.5% into 401(k) plans, while companies contributed 4.8%. Fidelity recommends saving at least 15% of pretax income each year to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement, assuming continuous savings from ages 25 to 67.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant deported to El Salvador. The order, responding to a request from a media coalition including CBS News, makes seven records available to the public, with some redactions to protect classified or sensitive information. The Justice Department had opposed the release, citing concerns about discovery materials and national security, but the judge found these arguments unconvincing. The Trump administration has acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status preventing his removal to El Salvador due to potential persecution by local gangs.</p>
