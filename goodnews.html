          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new manager, replacing Graham Potter, with the team currently in 19th place in the Premier League. Nuno, known for his success at Wolves and Nottingham Forest, is expected to implement a pragmatic, counter-attacking style that aligns with West Ham's strengths and historical successes under previous managers like David Moyes. His tactical approach, which emphasizes defensive solidity and quick transitions, is seen as a better fit for the current squad. The article suggests Nuno's strong interpersonal skills will also be crucial in revitalizing a team reportedly experiencing player discontent.</p>

President Xi previously emphasized a "forward-looking approach" to account for the evolving international landscape, and a public consultation on the plan was initiated in May.

          <p>England's Women's Rugby team, the Red Roses, are strategically planning to leverage their recent Rugby World Cup triumph to establish a lasting legacy for the sport. Post-victory celebrations and events like RugbyFest are designed to convert new fans into regular players and volunteers. Significant investments, such as the £14.5m 'Impact 25' program, are already yielding results with a 35% increase in age-grade girl players. The domestic Premiership Women's Rugby season will also see expanded live coverage. However, head coach John Mitchell warns against over-reliance on international players in the PWR, emphasizing the need to develop English talent to maintain global dominance.</p>

President Sandu had warned that the vote was critical for Moldova's path to the EU, having gained candidate status in 2022. Despite opposition leader Igor Dodon's premature claims of victory and calls for protests, the results indicate strong public support for a European future, even as the country grapples with economic challenges and a pro-Russian breakaway region.</p>

Both quarterbacks, Dak Prescott and Jordan Love, threw three touchdown passes in regulation, which featured seven consecutive lead changes. The game, highlighted by Micah Parsons' return to Dallas, saw Brandon Aubrey and Brandon McManus trade field goals in overtime, with McManus kicking a 34-yarder as time expired. This high-scoring contest marked the second-highest scoring tie in NFL history and was the first tie for Dallas since 1969, and for the Packers since 2018.</p>

          <h2>Declining Malls Create New Real Estate Opportunities for Small Businesses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 23:57:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for small and local businesses, which can now negotiate more favorable terms for prime commercial spaces. A recent Cushman & Wakefield report indicates a national shopping center vacancy rate increase to 5.8% in Q2 2025, leading to easing pressure on asking rents. This trend allows non-traditional tenants like health practitioners, fitness operators, and artists to secure locations previously out of reach, often with flexible leases, partial fit-outs, or rent-free periods. While rental rates still rise, the slower pace and increased vacancies offer a lifeline for entrepreneurs seeking physical presence. (not investment advice)</p>
