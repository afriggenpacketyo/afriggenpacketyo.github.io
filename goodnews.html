          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued an emergency order preventing the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an urgent lawsuit filed by lawyers for the children. The judge justified the extraordinary 14-day restraining order by noting the government's plan was being executed during the "wee hours" of a holiday weekend. The administration argued it was repatriating children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys who cited U.S. laws protecting vulnerable minors.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey addressed the question of what would happen if all Americans became debt-free, arguing the economy would not collapse but could actually improve. He posits that debt-free individuals do not stop spending; instead, they engage in more responsible spending because they have more disposable income. Ramsey stated that while lenders and finance companies would suffer, the balance of power would shift back to consumers. He believes the economy thrives on people controlling their own income, which also leads to increased generosity, rather than being dependent on a cycle of borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 in a crucial early-season Premier League match, striking a significant psychological blow against their expected title challengers. The decisive moment came from a brilliant 83rd-minute free-kick by Dominik Szoboszlai, which broke the deadlock in a largely defensive game. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative approach was criticized as a missed opportunity, as his team rarely threatened the Liverpool goal. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 Premier League games, a run stretching back to 2012.</p>

With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, Kiko is moving west and is expected to strengthen over the next few days.

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lando Norris experienced a significant setback in his championship pursuit after being forced to retire from the Dutch Grand Prix due to an oil leak. The retirement allowed his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, to win the race and extend his lead in the standings to 34 points. Despite the frustrating result, Norris expressed his determination to recover, stating the points gap now allows him to simply "go for it" in the remaining nine races of the season. His retirement came with only seven laps to go while he was pressuring Piastri for the lead.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced that he recently had a basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, removed from the side of his face. He shared photos of the bandage and stitches on social media, using the experience to strongly encourage his followers to wear sunscreen. Ramsay, who has previously advocated for safety after a serious cycling accident, maintained a humorous tone, joking that the procedure was not a facelift. Dermatologists note that this type of skin cancer is the most common and has a very high cure rate with early detection and treatment.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that Europe is formulating "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of a post-conflict security arrangement. According to the Financial Times, this European-led force could involve tens of thousands of troops and would have the backing of U.S. capabilities, including intelligence and command systems. This development follows a reported agreement between U.S., Ukrainian, and European leaders, with further high-level discussions planned in Paris. The initiative aims to provide a robust security guarantee for Ukraine once the current conflict ends.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value.

This strategic partnership aims to create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's security capabilities in the North Atlantic.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, European Union foreign ministers discussed a range of new potential measures to bolster support for Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas floated were imposing secondary sanctions on countries and entities that help Russia's war effort, a move that could significantly increase economic pressure. Other proposals included inviting Ukrainian defense companies to establish production facilities within the EU and exploring more aggressive uses of frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. These discussions reflect the EU's search for more impactful ways to sustain Ukraine's defense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vibrant underwater forest off the coast of Southern California. The project, led by The Bay Foundation, involved an army of divers who smashed over 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins that had decimated the kelp beds, creating barren underwater landscapes. By clearing 80 acres of the sea floor, the team allowed the fast-growing kelp to return, restoring a critical habitat for over 800 marine species. The effort serves as a powerful model for ecosystem restoration.</p>
