          <p>According to a former UN secretary general, with the United States stepping back on climate change issues, China is positioned to lead the green transition, given its status as the largest emitter and a leader in clean energy manufacturing. Extreme weather events in China have caused significant economic damage, highlighting the importance of climate action for national resilience. Investing in clean energy and climate-smart solutions presents economic opportunities that can overcome political and economic divisions. China already leads in domestic renewable energy deployment and can further drive international investment in this sector.</p>

          <p>Amanda Johnson, a Marine spouse and mother of five, is challenging the U.S. military medical establishment after her family's move abroad was put on hold due to her children's vaccination status, despite official Navy policy not requiring vaccinations. Johnson argues that Navy Medical Jacksonville falsely claimed the family's medical readiness package was sent for final review. The family has filed a congressional inquiry and seeks reform to prevent doctors from denying travel based solely on vaccine status. Johnson wants accountability for those who denied the package, emphasizing that vaccination status is a personal matter for dependents unless required by the host country.</p>
