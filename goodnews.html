        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called off a planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie. The decision was also influenced by calls from prominent tech executives who noted the city's "substantial progress" in addressing public safety issues. Mayor Lurie confirmed the cancellation, highlighting recent statistics showing a significant citywide drop in crime, with violent crime at its lowest since the 1950s. This reversal of plans was supported by California Governor Gavin Newsom and praised by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a testament to the city's local leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected an attempt by the Trump administration to pause nearly all court cases concerning veterans' disability benefits during the ongoing government shutdown. The 9-0 ruling from the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims rebuffed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' argument that a lack of funding prevented the agency from meeting court deadlines. Veterans' advocacy groups had accused the administration of using the shutdown as a pretext to delay justice for veterans, some of whom have waited decades for their claims to be heard. The decision is a significant pushback against the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Intel's third-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, reaching $13.65 billion and signaling a recovery in demand for its PC processors. This marks the company's first earnings report since the U.S. government became its top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration. The company also received a $5.7 billion infusion from the government during the quarter, leading to complex accounting that is still awaiting SEC guidance due to the government shutdown. Intel projects fourth-quarter revenue of $13.3 billion and noted strong demand for its chips is currently outpacing supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a tentative ruling that requires the U.S. government to guarantee immigrant detainees at a Los Angeles processing center have access to legal counsel. The preliminary injunction extends a previous order addressing claims that detainees' Fifth Amendment rights were being violated. Attorneys for the plaintiffs described inhumane and coercive conditions at the facility, including a lack of beds and showers, which they argued heightened the need for legal access. The judge expressed concern that the government had continued to commit violations even after a temporary restraining order was put in place.</p>

          <p>Former special counsel Jack Smith has requested to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees regarding his investigations into President Trump. In a letter from his lawyers, Smith stated he is prepared to answer questions about the probes into Trump's handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. However, he requires assurance from the Department of Justice that he will not be punished for doing so, as well as guidance on grand jury secrecy rules. The move is an effort to counter what his lawyers call "many mischaracterizations" of his work.</p>

          <p>China's 10th-place finish in the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) annual Global Innovation Index has raised questions among some Chinese internet users about the ranking's methodology and potential bias. Despite China's strong performance in science and technology output, Switzerland secured the top spot for the 15th consecutive year. The debate highlights a domestic perception that China's innovative capacity may be undervalued by the widely recognized index. The WIPO's ranking is a prominent benchmark used to assess the innovation economies of countries around the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A plan to build a new Wawa convenience store and gas station on the east side of Indianapolis has been rejected for failing to comply with the city's transit-friendly zoning laws. A hearing examiner sided with city planners who argued the car-centric design, with over 60 parking spaces and numerous gas pumps, conflicted with development standards meant to promote dense, walkable areas along a future bus rapid transit line. Supporters argued the decision turns away a popular company from an underused lot, but opponents insisted on upholding the transit-oriented vision that voters approved. Wawa has the option to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed the Department of Justice that she believes there is not enough evidence to bring mortgage fraud charges against Senator Adam Schiff. The investigation into the California Democrat, a prominent critic of President Trump, was initiated after Trump publicly called for him to be charged. According to MSNBC, while Hayes found the case to be weak, a senior Justice Department official is pushing to keep the investigation active. Schiff has characterized the probe as a politically motivated effort by a "tinpot dictator" to intimidate opponents.</p>

          <p>Apple has lost a landmark lawsuit in the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal, which ruled that the company abused its dominant market position by charging excessive and unfair commission fees in its App Store. The case could benefit around 36 million iPhone and iPad users in the UK, with lawyers seeking approximately £1.5 billion in damages for purchases made over the last decade. The ruling asserts that Apple's 30% commission on developers and its exclusion of competing payment platforms constituted illegal practices. Apple has stated its intention to appeal the decision.

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations but lowered its financial guidance for 2025 due to a supplier fire. The fire at an aluminum supplier's plant is disrupting the production of Ford's profitable large trucks and is expected to cost the company between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Despite this setback, the automaker plans to mitigate the impact by significantly increasing truck production once supplies are restored. Without the fire, Ford's CFO stated the company would have raised its guidance, signaling strong underlying performance. (not investment advice)</p>
