          <p>The Broward Sheriff's Office is investigating an incident where a 5-year-old girl fell from a Disney cruise ship, prompting her father to heroically jump in and rescue her. Contrary to social media speculation, authorities clarified the girl was not being held over the railing by her parents, who were reportedly playing shuffleboard nearby. A maritime attorney praised the father's life-saving actions, noting that such incidents are rare during the day and usually end tragically. The successful rescue was also aided by the ship's crew and mandatory man-overboard detection systems.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive immigration policies, including swift deportations and a halt to migrant releases into the U.S. This figure starkly contrasts with peak numbers seen under the previous administration, which sometimes exceeded 6,000 per day. The administration's strategy also involves deploying troops, increasing interior enforcement, and using deterrents like the "Alligator Alcatraz" facility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel has agreed to the terms of a 60-day ceasefire proposal for its conflict with Hamas in Gaza. In a social media post, Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is the best they will get, though he did not provide specific details of the agreement. The announcement comes as both Qatar and Egypt are set to deliver the final proposal to Hamas, which has not yet publicly responded. This development follows a recent separate ceasefire between Israel and Iran, with ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional conflicts.</p>

          <p>France has implemented a comprehensive ban on smoking in most public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in a major public health initiative. The new law aims to "denormalize" smoking and reduce its prevalence, as tobacco-related illnesses claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. Violators of the ban face fines up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. Despite high taxes and previous bans in indoor spaces like restaurants, over 30% of French adults still smoke, prompting the government to take these stricter measures, leaving caf√© terraces as one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has passed the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, often called "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, known as "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to contaminated water in her community. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's powerful testimony before lawmakers was a key catalyst for the legislation, which serves as her legacy in protecting public health from environmental contamination.</p>

Microsoft's success is attributed to strong growth in its Azure cloud business. Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market and persistent high demand propelled its stock, overcoming earlier concerns about competition. Meta's outperformance was fueled by a blowout quarterly earnings report, showcasing its powerful advertising capabilities, which helped its stock recover from an earlier decline.

This move could see images of British wildlife, famous landmarks, or cultural icons appear on the next series of ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£20, and ¬£50 notes.

          <p>California has enacted significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970 law, in an effort to spur housing development. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, exempts most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas from CEQA's lengthy environmental review process and the threat of lawsuits from opponents. Proponents argue this will remove a major barrier that has stifled construction and driven up housing costs. The change represents a major political shift, prioritizing housing abundance over the leverage the environmental law has long provided to various interest groups.</p>

          <p>Park officials in Santa Clara County, California, have successfully captured a large, invasive Argentine black and white tegu that was spotted by hikers in a local park. These lizards, which can grow up to five feet long, pose a serious threat to native ecosystems by preying on the eggs of ground-nesting birds, snakes, and other local wildlife. The captured tegu was likely an escaped or released pet, as they are legal to own in California despite being banned in other states like Florida due to their invasive nature. The incident highlights the danger that even single escaped exotic pets can pose to local environments.</p>
