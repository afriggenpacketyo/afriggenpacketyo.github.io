          <p>A Czech zoo has announced the public debut of four rare Barbary lion cubs, a breed that is extinct in the wild. The birth of the three females and one male is a significant step in an international program aimed at preserving the species in captivity with the ultimate goal of reintroducing them to their native habitat in North Africa. The Barbary lion was wiped out from the wild by the 1960s due to human activities. Experts are in preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities about a potential reintroduction plan in the Atlas Mountains.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has given its final approval for a €13.5 billion project to construct the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting mainland Italy to the island of Sicily. The bridge will span 3.3 kilometers over the Messina Strait, an area with high seismic activity, and is designed to withstand earthquakes. The project has been attempted and scrapped multiple times over 50 years due to concerns about cost, environmental impact, and potential mafia involvement. Despite ongoing opposition from local politicians and residents, the government aims to complete construction by 2033.</p>

          <p>Scientists in South Korea have developed a temporary tattoo-like sticker that can detect the presence of GHB, a common drink-spiking drug, in one second. The discreet sensor changes color from yellow to red upon contact with a beverage containing the substance. The sticker is made from a flexible material and was proven effective in tests with various drinks, including alcohol and coffee. This innovation offers a fast and subtle way for individuals in social settings to check their drinks for tampering, providing a new layer of personal safety.</p>

The album features a more straightforward rock sound with live drums and scratchy guitars, a departure from the synth-heavy production of their previous work. Melo also discussed her recent sobriety and how it has influenced her direct and unfiltered lyrical approach on the new tracks.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced plans to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion over four years. The move comes as the company faces pressure from President Donald Trump, who has threatened significant tariffs on its products if it does not move more manufacturing to the US. The new funds will reportedly be used to encourage Apple's suppliers to establish more production in America. This announcement is seen as a strategic effort by Apple to avoid new tariffs on its products.</p>
