          <p>Sportswear giant Nike has announced plans to significantly cut its reliance on Chinese manufacturing to mitigate the financial impact of U.S. tariffs. The company stated that President Trump's trade policies could add approximately $1 billion to its costs this year. In response, Nike's CFO confirmed the company will reduce the portion of its U.S.-bound footwear made in China from 16% to a high single-digit percentage by 2026. The announcement came as Nike's shares rallied after it projected better-than-expected revenue, despite the ongoing trade uncertainties affecting global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reportedly agreed on a framework for a new trade deal, aiming to de-escalate recent tensions. President Trump announced a signed agreement, though officials later clarified it as a framework to implement a previous consensus reached in Geneva. The deal appears centered on China increasing its exports of rare earth minerals, which are crucial for U.S. high-tech and defense industries, in exchange for the U.S. easing certain restrictive measures. This development follows a period of escalating tariffs that have negatively impacted both of the world's largest economies, signaling a potential stabilization in their fraught trade relationship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have potentially identified the oldest rocks on Earth, located in Quebec's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. While previous studies yielded conflicting ages, a new analysis using two different dating techniques on a new sample produced a consistent age of approximately 4.16 billion years. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and rocks from its earliest period are exceedingly rare due to geological recycling. Studying these ancient formations could provide invaluable insights into the planet's early conditions, such as the formation of tectonic plates and the origins of life, though access to the site is currently restricted by the local Inuit community to prevent damage.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd.

This strategic push into Europe is driven by overcapacity and shrinking profit margins in China.

          <p>A coalition of high-profile sports stars, including Mike Tyson and Kevin Durant, has sent a letter to the White House urging President Trump to enact comprehensive cannabis reform. The group's requests include granting clemency for nonviolent federal marijuana offenses and reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance to facilitate medical research and economic growth. They also called for an end to discriminatory banking practices that prevent state-legal cannabis businesses from accessing financial services. The letter criticizes the previous administration for a lack of action and positions the issue as an opportunity for criminal justice reform.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a national parliamentary election in July, the Japanese government has formally requested that major social media operators help counter the spread of disinformation and defamation targeting candidates. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications asked nine platforms, including X and Line, to clarify and expedite their processes for removing harmful content. The move comes as Japan's political parties jointly recognize the threat that false information poses to fair elections. This reflects a growing global concern over the role of social media in politics, balancing the need for regulation with free speech protections.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates a split in the luxury real estate market, with the ultra-wealthy (worth $30M+) continuing to make large, all-cash purchases despite economic uncertainty. In contrast, the less-wealthy but still affluent buyers are more cautious and sensitive to high interest rates. According to a Coldwell Banker survey, over half of luxury agents have seen an increase in cash purchases in 2025, a trend driven by a desire to avoid high borrowing costs. While real estate is still seen as a stable asset, the market saw a dip in May, and sellers are increasingly reducing list prices to attract more discerning buyers. (not investment advice)</p>
