          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran confirmed he spoke with President Trump before this week's interest rate decision but stated he was not pressured on how to vote. Miran, who dissented from the committee's quarter-point rate cut in favor of a larger half-point reduction, emphasized that his decision was made independently. The conversation occurs amid ongoing concerns about the central bank's autonomy due to the President's vocal criticism and repeated calls for more aggressive rate cuts. Miran also dismissed concerns about a potential conflict of interest regarding his status at the Council of Economic Advisers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call aimed at finalizing a deal that would prevent the social media platform TikTok from being banned in the United States. This discussion follows the establishment of a "framework" agreement earlier in the week intended to resolve U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump, who has previously extended the divestment deadline multiple times, has publicly expressed a desire to preserve the platform's value for its American business operations and user base.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the price hike on the new iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the new iPhone's launch event, Cook stated definitively that tariffs were not factored into the new pricing structure. This comes as Apple has been actively shifting parts of its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam to mitigate the financial impact of the ongoing trade dispute. The company had previously reported taking a significant financial hit from tariffs in a prior quarter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of TikTok in the United States may depend on a licensing deal for its highly coveted recommendation algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations between the U.S. and China. The Chinese government had previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, which is key to the app's success, but its position may be softening. A potential deal could involve a U.S. entity licensing, or "renting," the algorithm from parent company ByteDance, though this raises concerns about whether China could retain access or influence over the technology. National security experts remain wary that such an arrangement might not fully resolve data privacy and manipulation risks.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations outlining key details of President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative. The new provision, enacted in July, allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 through 2028, with the benefit phasing out for higher earners. The guidance clarifies that jobs in specified service fields like healthcare and legal services will not qualify. Additionally, automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered eligible for the deduction because they are not voluntary payments.

          <h2>Speculation Mounts Over Potential Paramount Skydance Bid for Warner Bros. Discovery</h2>

          <p>A potential offer from the newly merged Paramount Skydance for Warner Bros. Discovery could be in the range of $22 to $24 per share, according to sources familiar with the matter. This speculation follows earlier reports that Paramount Skydance was preparing a large cash bid to acquire the media giant, which could preempt Warner Bros. Discovery's own plans to separate its TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. While the price range is not confirmed, the news caused a slight increase in Warner Bros. Discovery's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Retailers Employ 'Tariff Hacking' Strategy to Mitigate Costs for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 10:38:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as "tariff hacking" or B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. The model involves routing online orders through a third-party middleman company, which acts as the official merchant of record. This intermediary purchases the product from the retailer at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price. This creative arbitrage can significantly cut tariff costs, allowing brands to avoid passing the full expense on to customers, though some experts question the long-term viability and scalability of the practice.

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest has officially begun in Munich, Germany, with millions of visitors expected over the next two and a half weeks. A notable feature of this year's festival is the record-high price of beer, with a one-liter stein, or Mass, costing over €15 at most tents. Despite the rising costs, organizers anticipate that around seven million liters of beer will be consumed. The festival is also making strides in sustainability, with a goal to become fully climate-neutral by 2028 by using green electricity, recycling water, and promoting regional and organic food options.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop illegal migration across the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advised that military intervention was a viable option, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected the idea, stating that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense issues around the world. The comments came as the UK deported a second migrant under a new returns deal with France, a diplomatic approach favored by the current government.</p>

This new service, utilizing the Northern Sea Route, offers a significantly shorter transit time compared to the traditional Suez Canal path. While the route is more expensive per container, it is being marketed as a faster alternative for time-sensitive and high-value goods, such as e-commerce parcels and power batteries. The move highlights China's growing commercial interest in the Arctic as melting ice makes the route more accessible for shipping.</p>

          <p>False claims that Poland officially deployed troops to Ukraine have been circulating on some social media platforms, particularly in China. These reports appear to stem from a misinterpretation of comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who mentioned that Polish military representatives would visit Ukraine to discuss drone defense. The Polish Ministry of Defense has since clarified that any planned training or cooperation will take place exclusively on Polish territory. The fact-check reveals how unclearly formulated remarks were amplified and distorted by content farms to create a sensational but inaccurate narrative of escalating conflict.</p>
