          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance as investors closely monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit and grappled with persistent U.S. tariff uncertainties. A recent U.S. federal appeals court ruling declared most of former President Trump's global tariffs illegal, contributing to market volatility. India's markets are under scrutiny following Trump's assertion that India offered to eliminate its tariffs on U.S. imports, an offer he criticized as belated. Additionally, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission imposed a significant fine on Societe Generale for failing to prevent suspicious trading activities in futures markets.

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, will not seek re-election in 2026, advocating for "generational change" within the party. His decision was influenced by former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election. Nadler, 78, first elected in 1992, previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee and managed former President Trump's first impeachment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a "relentless fighter for justice" and civil rights, acknowledging his significant contributions to American public service.</p>

The jackpot surged after no winner emerged from Saturday's $1 billion drawing, though several tickets won $1 million or $2 million prizes. The next drawing is scheduled for Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. ET, offering players another chance at the significant sum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have designed a compact, detergent-free washing machine for astronauts, addressing the challenge of laundry in space. The cube-shaped device, weighing 12kg, uses only 400ml of water per cycle by employing an ultra-fine mist. Instead of traditional detergents, it utilizes ultraviolet light to produce ozone, effectively sterilizing clothes for multiple wears. This innovative technology aims to provide a practical solution for personal hygiene and clothing maintenance during long-duration space missions, conserving precious onboard resources.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without a deportation order, just as flights were prepared to depart. The judge intervened after lawyers argued the effort circumvented legal protections for minors, who could face abuse or persecution upon return. The Justice Department stated 76 children were slated for repatriation, which they claimed was to reunite families, but attorneys disputed this. The ruling ensures these children remain in U.S. custody, allowing them to pursue legal protections.</p>
