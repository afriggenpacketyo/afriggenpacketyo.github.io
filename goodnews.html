          <p>The New York Giants, fueled by strong performances from rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart and running back Cam Skattebo, delivered a stunning 34-17 defeat to the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The game ignited controversy and backlash as the Eagles, inside the 10-yard line, ran the "tush push" play four straight times to score a touchdown, with critics like Micah Parsons and Dave Portnoy condemning its overuse. This marked the Eagles' second consecutive loss and Jalen Hurts' first interception of the season, while the Giants secured only their fourth victory against Philadelphia in their last 18 encounters, highlighting a significant upset.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, thanks to a crucial tip-off received through the international "Operation Identify Me" campaign. Known as "the woman with the German keys," her body was discovered in sand dunes near Wassenaar, wearing unusual clothing for a beach walk and carrying a key linked to Bottrop, Germany. This identification, made after two decades, marks the fourth success for the Interpol-coordinated initiative aimed at naming women who died in suspicious circumstances across Europe. The cause of her death remains unexplained, and police are continuing their investigation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a groundbreaking discovery, finding that salt-laced ice can generate electricity when subjected to bending. This research reveals that salt-doped ice produces an electrical response comparable to advanced ceramic materials used for their electrical properties, a phenomenon attributed to flexoelectricity. This innovative approach, detailed in a Nature Physics paper, opens up significant possibilities for developing low-cost, clean energy sources in cold environments. The team has successfully fabricated devices from saline ice, showcasing its practical potential to harness power, marking a novel advancement in energy generation.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly released a policy paper to address "disorderly price competition" across key industries. This initiative aims to mitigate negative impacts on industry development, product innovation, and quality and safety, which are deemed detrimental to the national economy. The agencies will guide industry associations in evaluating average production costs to help companies establish reasonable prices and will intervene with warnings, cost investigations, and price inspections when price wars are suspected. This signals a concerted effort by Chinese authorities to stabilize market order and promote sustainable economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's chip and AI-related stocks have witnessed a world-beating rally in recent months, largely fueled by the nation's strategic push for technological self-sufficiency and a directive for firms to reduce reliance on Nvidia processors. Despite this strong performance, the soaring valuations are beginning to test investors' patience, with concerns arising that high multiples offer minimal margin for error if companies do not meet expectations. A gauge of Chinese semiconductor shares has surged 55% since late June, significantly outperforming global chip markets. This rapid appreciation, however, prompts questions about the long-term sustainability and potential for market adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indonesian authorities successfully intercepted a cargo ship attempting to smuggle hundreds of undocumented logs at a port in Batam, following a crucial tip from a member of the public. The joint operation by Indonesia's Maritime Security Agency and the Ministry of Forestry uncovered 99 Meranti and 344 mixed hardwood logs, all lacking necessary permits and violating national laws. Officials emphasized that this successful operation demonstrates how citizen reports significantly bolster law enforcement efforts to safeguard forests, highlighting the global scale of illegal logging as the third-largest transnational crime and a primary cause of tropical deforestation.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is reportedly poised to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, aiming to unseat the long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, was a key recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and previously gained national attention for her public confrontation with President Trump regarding his administration's policies on transgender athletes. Her anticipated entry into the race sets the stage for a closely watched contest, presenting a rare opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat in the Senate, especially in a state that has leaned Democratic in recent presidential elections.</p>

This approach aims to reduce reliance on China and bolster security autonomy. Her foreign policy is expected to emphasize strategic self-interest, potentially deepening "friendshoring" with Southeast Asia but with aid and investment increasingly tied to geopolitical alignment.</p>

          <p>"Battlefield 6," the latest entry in the military shooter series, is gearing up for a significant launch, with developers aiming to rival "Call of Duty." Developed by four EA-owned studios, the game incorporates lessons from the previous, negatively received "Battlefield 2042," including early fan playtests and the reintroduction of a single-player campaign. Despite the substantial investment and scale of the project, developers express optimism, highlighting positive community feedback and the strategic use of generative AI in preparatory stages to foster creativity, though not for direct in-game content. Analysts anticipate strong initial sales, marking a crucial test for the franchise's resurgence in the competitive gaming market.</p>

The legislation will allow the FAIR Plan to issue bonds and secure lines of credit to manage catastrophic claims, while also enhancing legislative oversight by adding non-voting members to its governing committee. These reforms are crucial for stabilizing California's insurance market, which has seen insurers withdraw due to climate-fueled firestorms, ensuring that property owners can still obtain essential coverage and promoting greater transparency.</p>

In exchange, Israel will release Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The agreement also mandates a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza and the deployment of a multinational force to monitor the ceasefire.

This "gigantic" leap, facilitated by Medtronic's donation of expired human devices, allows scientists to pinpoint moments of stress and understand factors that impede an animal's ability to thrive and breed.

This dolphin-sized marine reptile, dating back approximately 185 million years, represents the only known example of its kind and fills a significant gap in ichthyosaur evolution. Scientists observed several distinctive features, including a prong-like bone near its nostril and a long, sword-like snout. Intriguingly, marks on its skull suggest the "sword dragon" may have been killed by a bite from a much larger ichthyosaur, providing a glimpse into the dangerous ancient marine ecosystem.</p>
