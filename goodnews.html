          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will be honored with a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his role in upholding the constitutional transfer of power on January 6, 2021. The JFK Library Foundation recognized Pence for resisting pressure from Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, a decision that put his life and career at risk. Pence, who has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party since leaving office, will receive the award from Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg at the JFK Library in Boston. President Kennedy's book, *Profiles in Courage*, profiles senators who took principled stands and faced criticism as a result.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused fundraising dinners this month, one targeting wealthy political donors and another aimed at meme coin millionaires. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate dinner, will feature David Sacks, who has been influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will grant access to Trump's inner circle to the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP token, determined by a blockchain-based contest. While the $TRUMP contest terms do not guarantee access to Trump, it has significantly increased demand for the coin and generated substantial trading fees for insiders, with roughly 80% of the token supply controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates.</p>

          <p>Employees at a Norwegian fruit distributor discovered a large quantity of cocaine hidden within a shipment of bananas, leading to the seizure of 147 kilos of the drug. The haul, estimated to have a street value of $16.4 million, is the largest in Norway since 2023. The drugs were smuggled by sea from South America and transported through Sweden, likely intended for pickup at the Antwerp port. Customs officials believe a large criminal network is responsible for the attempted smuggling. This incident is part of a recurring trend of cocaine being found concealed in banana shipments across the globe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that CD interest rates are likely to remain steady or slightly decrease in May 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting and potential future rate cuts. While an increase in CD rates is unlikely, the stability or slight decrease suggests savers should consider locking in rates now to maximize returns. Factors such as ongoing economic uncertainty and inflation will play a role in the Fed's decision, impacting the CD rate climate. Shorter CD terms may offer higher interest rates due to market uncertainty, but savers should compare options and consider early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>
