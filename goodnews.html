          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprising pole position for the Singapore Grand Prix, outperforming Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the McLaren team. Russell's fastest lap was secured despite a minor collision with the wall, marking his first pole since June. Verstappen, who finished second, expressed frustration, blaming McLaren's Lando Norris for impeding his final qualifying lap. Championship leader Oscar Piastri will start in third, ahead of his rival and teammate Norris, setting up a competitive race.</p>

          <p>The FBI has indicted two men, Arick Komarczyk and Irazmar Carbajal, for their alleged involvement in a money laundering network connected to the children of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The years-long investigation uncovered that the men allegedly opened U.S. bank accounts and moved sanctioned funds. FBI Director Kash Patel stated that such schemes are "criminal lifelines" for the Maduro regime and that the U.S. will not be a safe haven for illicit funds.

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to sell GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members for approximately $499 for a four-week supply. This price is roughly half the typical out-of-pocket cost, making the popular medications more accessible to those whose insurance does not cover them. The move comes amid soaring demand and high prices for these drugs, which has led some consumers to seek out unregulated compounded versions. This initiative could increase access and further fuel the high demand for these treatments.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work led by a Japanese team, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor, Egypt. Dating back over 3,000 years, the tomb is one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings and features exquisite wall paintings. The restoration was a delicate process, involving over 260 specialists to address severe deterioration. The opening of the site is a significant event for tourism and the preservation of ancient Egyptian heritage.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a U.S.-proposed peace deal, notably the release of all hostages taken during its attack on Israel. While accepting key terms, the group indicated that other aspects of the plan require further negotiation. In response, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. U.S. and Israeli officials are reportedly preparing for indirect talks to begin in Egypt.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. After being left off the wild-card series roster, the future Hall of Famer is expected to provide a steady presence from the bullpen. His inclusion is also seen as a strategic move to add left-handed pitching depth against the Phillies' lineup. This will likely give Kershaw a final opportunity to pitch in the postseason before his anticipated retirement.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, U.S. stock markets continued to perform strongly, with the S&P 500 reaching its 29th record high of the year. The healthcare sector saw a significant relief rally, with shares of companies like Danaher and Eli Lilly surging following a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs. The technology and utilities sectors also performed well, partly driven by the continued investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. This market resilience suggests that investors currently view the government shutdown as a non-event for the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets being near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. They argue that the average U.S. investor has a significant "home bias," potentially missing out on better value and growth opportunities abroad. Emerging markets, particularly China and India, are highlighted as having long-term potential driven by favorable demographics and rapid economic growth. This strategy is presented as a way to balance portfolios and capitalize on global economic trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García for human smuggling may be an act of illegal retaliation by the Trump administration. The judge granted a hearing after finding "some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive," citing the timing of the charges and public statements by administration officials. Ábrego García was charged shortly after he successfully sued the administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. The case has become a focal point in the broader political conflict over U.S. immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Days of violent protests in Pakistan-administered Kashmir have ended after a civil rights alliance reached a deal with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were organized to demand cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to benefits for the political elite. The government has agreed to the demands, prompting the alliance leader to call for protesters to disperse. The breakthrough came after a high-level delegation was sent to the region's capital, Muzaffarabad, to negotiate with protest leaders.</p>
