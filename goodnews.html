          <p>A school district in DeKalb County, Georgia, is observing significant positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers and administrators at Lakeside High School report that since implementing the policy, student engagement has increased while disciplinary issues have decreased substantially. This local initiative is stricter than a forthcoming statewide ban and reflects a growing national trend, with over half of U.S. states now regulating phone use in schools to improve the learning environment.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that a coalition of 26 nations has committed to providing post-war security guarantees for Ukraine. The plan involves deploying an international "reassurance force" on land, sea, and air to deter any future aggression once the current conflict ends. The announcement came after a Paris summit aimed at solidifying European support and securing backing from the United States, whose specific contributions are still being finalized amid ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A spokeswoman has confirmed that former President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer by removing thin layers of tissue until no cancerous cells remain. This follows a 2023 physical exam where a small lesion on his chest was identified and removed, later confirmed as basal cell carcinoma. The confirmation of the recent surgery came after Biden was seen with a wound on his head in published photos.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie, an unfinished musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered among his personal archives. The notes, found in his locked New York study after his death, reveal his deep interest in 18th-century London, including its art, satire, criminal gangs, and social commentary. This secret project, which would have fulfilled a lifelong ambition to write for the theater, will be made available for public viewing at the V&A Museum's new David Bowie Centre.</p>

This change was associated with a clinically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, especially among older adult participants, highlighting a potential dietary approach to cardiovascular health.</p>
