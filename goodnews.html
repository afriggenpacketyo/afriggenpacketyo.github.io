          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war after high-level talks in Geneva. Details of the agreement are expected to be announced soon, with President Trump praising the talks for a "total reset" in the relationship. The escalating trade war has seen both countries impose steep tariffs on each other's goods, disrupting global supply chains and impacting both economies, and the BBC found that Chinese exporters were struggling with the US's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry‚Äôs public plea to reconcile with King Charles III has brought renewed attention to the ongoing rifts within the British royal family. Despite King Charles's efforts to fulfill his duties amidst cancer treatment, the focus remains on the estrangement between him and Prince Harry, as well as Prince William. Some royal watchers believe that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed. The palace has pushed back on Harry‚Äôs contention that his father could have done more to spare him the loss of automatic, publicly funded police protection when he visits Britain.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made "substantial progress" in trade talks after meetings in Geneva. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a "deal" had been reached addressing national security concerns about China's trade practices. The talks aim to ease tensions after President Trump initiated a trade war, and economists have warned that the dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession. Both sides have indicated they would like to find a path to bring the tariffs down, as the tariffs are so punitive they are already disrupting the world‚Äôs supply chains.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Iran have concluded a fourth round of nuclear talks in Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again. U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff described the discussions as encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called them "difficult but useful." The U.S. insists Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment, while Tehran maintains it has no intention of giving up the program. Araghchi noted that the talks had been "more serious and more direct" but criticized "contradictory positions taken by the US in the media.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has indefinitely suspended chess due to concerns that the game promotes gambling. Officials stated that the ban will remain until the game's compatibility with Islamic law is determined. This is the latest restriction on sports imposed by the Taliban, who have already largely barred women from participating in sports. A cafe owner in Kabul, who hosted informal chess competitions, expressed respect for the decision but noted it would negatively impact his business, as young people have few recreational activities available.</p>

          <p>A recent Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Walton Goggins as a hyper-sexualized waiter flirting with middle-aged mothers has drawn criticism for reinforcing negative stereotypes. While the sketch seemingly aimed to challenge the notion that mothers are undesirable and lack desire, it ultimately undermined this idea by implying the absurdity of a man genuinely being attracted to ‚Äúsilly, frumpy old moms.‚Äù The show failed to offer a refreshing view of motherhood and instead perpetuated the view that motherhood is antithetical to sexuality, which is further emphasized by a segment of ‚ÄúWeekend Update‚Äù.</p>

He highlights the importance of simple human instinct and common sense in decision-making. The article references the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects where instinct trumped extensive data analysis.</p>

The site includes walls, a central staircase, and a stage, suggesting it was used for ritual performances. Friezes with images of cats, reptiles, and a human-bird hybrid were found in fine plaster, helping scientists determine the site's age and religious origins.
