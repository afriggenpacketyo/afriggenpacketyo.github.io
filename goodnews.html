          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a trade agreement, setting a 15% tariff on South Korean imports, a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. As part of the deal, South Korea will invest $350 billion in the U.S., though interpretations differ on how the funds will be utilized, with Seoul aiming to support its own industries' entry into the American market. The agreement also includes a commitment from South Korea to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products, while U.S. goods will not face any new tariffs. This development follows a similar deal struck between the U.S. and Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not be a candidate for California governor in the 2026 election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after serious consideration, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest that while she was tempted by the role, her heart wasn't in it, and this choice keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run while she focuses on other forms of public engagement.</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), led by Franklin Graham, has established a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal challenges over their beliefs. The fund was initiated with money from court settlements BGEA won in the U.K. after its events were canceled over activist complaints. Cissie Graham Lynch, Franklin Graham's daughter, emphasized the importance of defending religious freedom and free speech, stating that such pressures are also growing in the United States. The organization aims to provide both financial and advocacy support for individuals standing for their biblical beliefs in court.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, triggered tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific Ocean. The powerful temblor generated waves that prompted evacuations in parts of Russia, Japan, and Hawaii, with alerts extending to the U.S. West Coast and South America. While the initial warnings caused significant concern and led to precautionary measures, the resulting waves were smaller than feared, causing minor flooding in some coastal areas but no major damage or serious injuries. By Wednesday afternoon, most warnings had been downgraded or canceled, though advisories remained in some regions.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies have significantly bolstered their bullpen by acquiring hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins ahead of the MLB trade deadline. In exchange for Durán, who has a 2.01 ERA this season, the Phillies sent two top prospects to Minnesota. The move was part of a busy day of trades, which also saw the New York Mets strengthen their relief pitching by acquiring Ryan Helsley and Tyler Rogers. In another notable deal, the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates, signaling a competitive market for talent as teams position themselves for the season's final stretch.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company argues its proposal would reduce risk and spiraling costs compared to Heathrow's official plan. This development introduces a competitive bidding process for the first time, as the government reviews different options for increasing the airport's capacity to boost the UK's global connectivity.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. This strong performance was driven by a significant increase in net deposits and higher valuations in equity and cryptocurrency markets. The growth reflects Robinhood's strategic push into wealth management and its success in attracting new assets, although shares dipped slightly after the company projected higher future costs related to its recent Bitstamp acquisition.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani caused a moment of concern when he left the mound in the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Accompanied by a trainer, Ohtani's early exit was later announced as being due to cramping, a relief for the team and its fans. Although he remained in the game as the designated hitter, the Dodgers ultimately lost 5-2. The incident occurred on a hot and humid night, and while it momentarily overshadowed the game, the news that the two-way phenom avoided a more serious injury was the most significant outcome for the team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision keeps the rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, though an unusual dissent from two board members who favored a cut suggests growing support for lower rates. Policymakers are navigating a complex economic landscape, weighing the inflationary potential of new tariffs against signs of slowing growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has advocated for a cautious approach, stating there is a long way to go before the full impact of the administration's trade policies becomes clear.

          <p>Following the major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. These powerful waves are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes, particularly those with strong vertical motion that displaces the seafloor. The recent 8.8-magnitude quake possessed all these characteristics, warranting immediate Pacific-wide warnings. Tsunamis travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and build in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, where they become most dangerous. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use a network of tide gauges and deep-ocean sensors to better predict their arrival and potential impact.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed dense beds of clams, mats of bacteria, and fields of tube worms, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that such chemosynthetic communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>

          <p>A group of UK scientists is challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains, arguing that concrete scientific evidence for negative outcomes is lacking. Psychology professor Pete Etchells and others point out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and often confuses correlation with causation. While some studies suggest links to mental health issues, others have found little to no connection, indicating factors like loneliness may be more significant. The debate highlights the complexity of the issue, as the term "screen time" encompasses a wide range of activities, from passive viewing to interactive learning and socializing.</p>

Researchers, collaborating with a tattooist specializing in ancient methods, concluded that the designs were sophisticated and would be challenging even for modern artists.

At 30, Witherspoon is seen by defensive coordinator Chris Shula as the "Yoda" of the position group, providing a calming and savvy presence for younger players. After a strong performance last season, the Rams re-signed him to a one-year deal, a vote of confidence in the continuity of their defensive backfield. Witherspoon is looking forward to the combination of the defense's aggressive front line and the secondary's experience and communication skills.</p>
