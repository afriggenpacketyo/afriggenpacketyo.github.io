          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 01:03:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Stellantis setting production timelines around 2027-2028. Often called the "holy grail" for EVs, this technology promises higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion batteries. While some experts see this as a pivotal step towards next-generation EVs, others remain skeptical, pointing to high costs and persistent technical challenges, especially as existing battery technologies continue to improve rapidly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to a surge in home run power that helped overcome ongoing offensive struggles. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Will Smith added two solo shots, contributing to a four-homer night for the team. While the win provided a much-needed boost, it highlighted the team's reliance on power hitting amidst a broader slump in batting performance. The game ended with concern as closer Tanner Scott left with a potential arm injury.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first wave of sanctions against individuals and companies involved in people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. The new measures will freeze assets and impose travel bans on targets, including gang leaders, corrupt officials, and those supplying equipment like small boats. This strategy is a key part of the current government's plan to disrupt illegal immigration by targeting the financial networks of the criminal gangs. The move comes amid pressure to address the increasing number of small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a writer from the Balkans reflects on the frustrating expectation from Western publishers that her work must focus on regional trauma, war, or political turmoil to be considered for translation. She argues that this unspoken condition limits the scope of stories from the region, reducing its authors to explainers of historical tragedy rather than creators of universal art. The author calls for publishers to embrace a wider diversity of narratives from the Balkans, including stories that challenge stereotypes and explore everyday human experiences beyond the lens of conflict.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that a new round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia is scheduled to take place in Istanbul on Wednesday. This development follows recent pressure from the United States, including threats of "severe" sanctions against Russia if a ceasefire is not achieved. While Ukraine is preparing for discussions that could include prisoner exchanges, Moscow has not officially commented and has downplayed the likelihood of a significant breakthrough. Previous negotiations held in the same city have failed to produce a lasting ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced significant changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, following a highly critical report from the public inquiry's chair. Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the goal is to restore trust among victims who were given contaminated blood products by the NHS. Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they noted some key issues still require further consultation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while Donald Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have an unintended positive consequence. The author suggests that the tariffs are forcing countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. By exposing the economic drag of their own protectionist policies, the tariff crisis could be a catalyst for these nations to pursue domestic free-market reforms. This could ultimately lead to greater economic efficiency and growth within those regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the National Archives has released a massive trove of more than 230,000 newly digitized documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The release includes FBI investigation files and information concerning convicted assassin James Earl Ray. In response, King's family supported transparency but urged the public to view the files in the context of the FBI's historical surveillance campaign against the civil rights leader. The release comes as the White House faces pressure to declassify files on other high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Texas officials have confirmed that most of the more than 160 people reported missing after the devastating July Fourth floods have been accounted for and are safe. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, primarily in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. Officials explained that the initial high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists who left the area without checking in after the disaster. After an exhaustive effort to verify each report, only three individuals from the hardest-hit county remain unaccounted for.</p>
