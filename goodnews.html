          <p>This article explores the historical and biblical basis for the seven-day week, contrasting it with attempts to alter work schedules. It highlights the importance of both work and rest, referencing the biblical figure of Joseph as an example of success through meaningful work. Modern research supports the idea of a 'productivity ceiling,' suggesting that excessive work hours beyond 55 hours a week do not increase output. The article concludes that balancing work with a dedicated day for rest and reflection, as suggested by the Bible, is essential for a fulfilling and productive life.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating the cadets and taking credit for the United States' military strength. He highlighted a shift in U.S. foreign policy away from nation-building and ideological experiments, emphasizing a focus on crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. Trump also mentioned the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies and touted a new peacetime recruiting record. However, CBS News found that military enlistments began rebounding before his administration, suggesting recruitment reforms introduced during the previous administration may have played a role.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, addressing graduates amid the administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation, West Point disbanded several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers. Trump has also dismissed the boards of visitors of military academies, claiming without evidence that the schools were infiltrated by "Woke Leftist Ideologues." Former West Point teachers have criticized these changes, arguing that DEI programs did not inhibit the values, training, and education of the academies.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered a key component of a mysterious artifact at Sutton Hoo, England: the base of a sixth-century Byzantine bucket. The bucket, known as the Bromeswell bucket, was accidentally unearthed in 1986 and depicts a North African hunting scene. Excavations revealed that the bucket contained cremated animal and human remains, along with an intact comb, potentially shedding light on the burial's significance. Researchers believe the bucket, originally from the Byzantine Empire, was repurposed as a cremation vessel, signaling the high status and connections of the interred individual.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States' next-generation fighter jets and their 'loyal wingmen' drones could help counter China's advantage in fleet size and expand the operational range in a potential Indo-Pacific conflict. General David Allvin, chief of staff of the US Air Force, showcased the YFQ-42A unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and lethality. The UCAV is part of the air force's collaborative combat aircraft program (CCA), designed to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions. However, analysts caution that China is rapidly catching up in this area of military technology, narrowing the gap.</p>

          <p>Dr. Stephanie Venn-Watson, while studying aging dolphins for the U.S. Navy, discovered C15:0, a saturated fatty acid that improves health outcomes in mammals. She identified this nutrient after analyzing thousands of samples and observing that the healthiest aging dolphins had it in common. Dr. Venn-Watson now eats certain foods high in C15:0 to increase her intake of the longevity nutrient, and has developed a C15:0 supplement for humans. Her discovery marks the first essential fatty acid found in more than ninety years.</p>
