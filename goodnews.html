          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election in a tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, revealing deep divisions within the country. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki, who was supported by President Trump. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland. Nawrocki's victory complicates Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his liberal agenda, as the president holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation, potentially hindering Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises. The article indicates the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027.</p>

Japan's top tariff negotiator is arranging to visit the United States for trade talks, aiming to reach common ground ahead of a summit between the two countries' leaders. Capital spending by Japanese companies rose 6.4% in Jan.-March, reflecting robust investment to boost production capacity and advance digitalization. Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association, and Japanese universities have obtained around 2.7 billion yen in defense tech subsidies since fiscal 2015. A commercial whaling ship returned to a port in northeastern Japan carrying 25 fin whales, and North Korea lifted a ban on the military use of space for national defense purposes. Finally, Samuel Gustafson hit a brace as Urawa Reds claimed a 2-1 win before the Club World Cup.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are leading an effort to create a comprehensive genomic atlas of Southeast Asia, addressing the historical underrepresentation of the region in the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, is the result of a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. Researchers collected samples from Southeast Asian populations covering six countries, five language families, and 30 ethnic languages, completing genome sequencing for 3,023 cases.</p>

          <p>A Harvard Chinese graduate's speech calling for unity in a divided world has drawn mixed reactions in the US and China. Jiang Yurong's address, delivered shortly after the US vowed to aggressively revoke Chinese students' visas, emphasized the value of international classrooms. Some in the US have flagged her alleged links with the Chinese Communist Party, while some Chinese social media users allege that the organization Ms. Jiang's father works for is backed by prominent American companies and foundations. Despite the criticism, Ms. Jiang's vision of a "shared humanity" resonated with many, particularly in China.</p>

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economic outlook, the aviation industry is expected to improve in profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association. Revenue, operating profits, and net profits of the industry are projected to increase from 2024, mainly due to lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, and jet fuel costs are expected to average $86 per barrel in 2025, down from $99 in 2024. The IATA noted that recent financial data show minimal fuel hedging activity over the past year, indicating that airlines will generally benefit from the reduced fuel cost.</p>

Multiple association sources said the Mongolian-born 40-year-old, now known as elder Miyagino, will leave the governing body amid uncertainty about the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024 after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers. Hakuho, a winner of 45 elite-level championships and 1,187 matches, retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>
