          <p>After President Trump's decision to pull funding from PBS, Sesame Street has partnered with Netflix to ensure its continued availability to a wide audience. The deal will bring new seasons and a library of previous episodes to Netflix's subscribers, while also maintaining the show's presence on PBS. This move follows a trend of Netflix increasing its focus on children's content, with the platform also adding new episodes of Peppa Pig and interactive games. Sesame Street, since its inception, has been dedicated to teaching children through entertaining lessons, even addressing important issues like obesity and music education.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge in their Hong Kong trading debut, rising as much as 14%. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds raised to construct a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. While facing challenges such as trade tensions and scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Defense, CATL's global expansion reflects the growing demand for EV batteries. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China attracted a substantial net capital inflow into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war challenges initiated by the U.S. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and the recent downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by Moody's. Analysts suggest that this shift indicates changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange in China reported a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion in April from both individuals and companies.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to initiate offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The project will involve studying the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assessing the environmental impact of such carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, as the country seeks to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, in an effort to stimulate its economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move comes as state-backed commercial lenders reduced their deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. The rate cuts are part of a broader package of stimulus measures announced by Beijing, including reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves.

While the government touts improvements in trade with the US, India, and the EU, details regarding costs, defense cooperation, and youth travel remain to be negotiated.

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, has broken the world record for the fastest run across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. He ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons every day, starting from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and finishing at Bondi Beach. The run raised money for cancer charities, inspired by Goodge's mother's passing from cancer in 2018. Along the way, he faced physical challenges such as lost toenails and hallucinations, but persevered by reflecting on his mother's strength.</p>
