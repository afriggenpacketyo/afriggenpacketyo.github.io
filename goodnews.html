          <h2>Missouri Judge Reinstates Block on Numerous State Abortion Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 05:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A state judge in Missouri has once again blocked many of the state's restrictive abortion laws, including a near-total ban. The ruling from Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang argues the restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters. This decision allows providers like Planned Parenthood to resume procedural abortions, though the state's Attorney General has vowed to appeal immediately. The ruling is the latest development in a prolonged legal battle over abortion access in Missouri following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>Joey "Jaws" Chestnut, the dominant figure in competitive eating, is set to return to the Nathan's Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after a controversial one-year suspension. Chestnut was barred in 2024 for a deal with a rival plant-based hot dog brand, a move that shocked the sport's followers. Now, the 16-time champion has reconciled with the event organizers and will once again compete for the coveted mustard belt in Coney Island. His return is expected to generate significant excitement, with fans and organizers welcoming back the undisputed king of the event.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic tour in Europe, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed concerns over Beijing's export controls on strategic materials like rare earths. Speaking in Berlin, Wang asserted that managing such exports is a sovereign right and that these materials should not become an issue between China and the European Union. He assured that the "normal needs" of European companies will be met as long as they comply with regulations and procedures. Wang's comments aim to ease tensions and pave the way for an upcoming China-EU summit amid growing European unease about supply chain dependencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dozens of American cities are opting for synchronized drone light shows instead of traditional fireworks for their Independence Day celebrations this year. The shift is primarily driven by safety concerns, particularly the risk of wildfires in drought-prone areas like Salt Lake City. Proponents also cite environmental benefits and the quieter nature of drones, which is more considerate to individuals with PTSD and pets. While not entirely without risk, the popularity of these high-tech displays is soaring, with companies struggling to meet the explosive demand for choreographed aerial performances.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the nation's 250th anniversary, NPR gathered reflections from everyday Americans on what freedom means to them. The responses, edited for clarity, reveal a wide spectrum of perspectives on this foundational concept. For some, freedom is intrinsically linked to safety from violence and economic hardship, while for others it represents the right to self-determination and the ability to live authentically. Many contributors also emphasized that true freedom involves a collective responsibility to ensure liberty and justice are extended to all members of society, not just a select few.</p>

          <p>In a unique sporting twist, 18-year-old Brazilian winger Estevao Willian is set to play against his future club, Chelsea, in the Club World Cup. The match will see his current team, Palmeiras, face the London club in a quarter-final showdown. Chelsea signed the highly-rated teenager, nicknamed 'Messinho', last summer but allowed him to remain with Palmeiras for another year, an agreement that included his participation in this tournament. The game provides an unusual opportunity for Chelsea's owners and fans to see their major investment in action before he officially joins their squad.</p>

Coach Rhian Wilkinson highlights the importance of the "Welsh red vein" running through the squad, which includes players with Welsh roots from abroad. Despite lacking the depth of larger nations, the team's family-like bond allows them to perform at a high level. The tournament is seen as a major opportunity to increase visibility and inspire the next generation of female players in Wales.</p>

          <p>A new short film titled "Final Finishers" shifts the focus of the New York City Marathon away from elite athletes to the amateur runners at the back of the pack. The documentary, which premiered at the Tribeca Festival, celebrates the perseverance of those who finish long after sunset, often overcoming significant personal challenges. Featured runners include a man who learned to run again after being paralyzed by a rare disease and another who took up the sport after a doctor laughed at his marathon ambitions. The film argues that the most relatable and inspiring stories are often found far from the podium.</p>

Authorities plan to investigate the man's motives for the crossing, which could be a defection attempt.

For the first time since 1970, the new series may move away from featuring historical figures to a new theme, such as nature, architecture, or innovation. The call for suggestions has generated a wide array of ideas, from celebrating Britain's maritime heritage and famous landmarks to featuring classic TV characters and vintage trains. While some question the need for a redesign in an increasingly cashless society, many have embraced the opportunity to shape the nation's currency.</p>

This financial boost provides a beacon of hope for defense and space companies, promising long-term funding for developing space-based interceptors, advanced sensors, and other capabilities aimed at achieving U.S. "space superiority."

          <p>Chinese state media has called for tighter regulation of "blind box" toys, a model central to the success of Pop Mart, maker of the popular Labubu dolls. However, analysts believe the company will remain resilient, as its primary demographic consists of young adults, not the young children targeted by the proposed regulations. Pop Mart's significant and rapidly growing overseas sales, which are projected to account for over half its revenue in 2025, provide a further cushion against domestic regulatory headwinds. The company's strategy of expanding its intellectual property portfolio is also key to its continued momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

Dozens of residents in the west Highlands reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang. While finding the meteorites in the vast, mountainous terrain will be difficult, UKMON has appealed to hillwalkers to keep an eye out for the rare space rocks.</p>
