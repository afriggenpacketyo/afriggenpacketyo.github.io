          <p>A report details the challenges that rising global temperatures pose to roads, railways, and bridges. Extreme heat reduces road traction, buckles rail tracks, and stresses bridge joints, increasing maintenance needs and the risk of infrastructure failure. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, white paint for rail lines, and bridge designs that accommodate thermal expansion. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining transport, trade, and travel in a warming world.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rise in premarket trading following a sharp decline attributed to tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts cited a Politico report suggesting Trump scheduled a call with Musk to broker a truce. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives noted the potential benefits of a renewed alliance for Tesla shares, considering the stock oversold due to the recent news. The recent verbal exchanges between Musk and Trump had negatively impacted Tesla's stock value.</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, potentially aiding Hong Kong's efforts to become a virtual asset hub. The municipal Public Security Bureau in Beijing has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to sell seized cryptoassets via regulated platforms in Hong Kong. Proceeds will be converted into yuan and deposited in designated accounts. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets through Hong Kong's virtual asset regime, as mainland China enforces a strict ban on crypto trading.</p>

          <p>Russia's central bank has lowered its interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling easing inflation pressures. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, the ruble has performed well this year due to capital controls and policy tightening. The central bank indicated that monetary policy would remain tight to return inflation to its 4% target. (not investment advice)</p>
