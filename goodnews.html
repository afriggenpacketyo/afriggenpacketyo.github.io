        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after initially suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net $2 billion impact from these levies. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations, though its stock saw a decline in after-hours trading. CEO Jim Farley highlighted ongoing "constructive conversations" with the Trump administration to mitigate the effects of tariffs on imported parts, which are crucial despite the company's large U.S. manufacturing presence. The updated guidance reflects lower earnings projections than before the tariff announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft's market value exceeded $4 trillion in after-hours trading, making it the second company to reach this milestone, following Nvidia. The surge was driven by a strong quarterly earnings report, where the company announced its fastest revenue growth in over three years, largely fueled by its Azure cloud computing business. This achievement highlights Microsoft's successful capitalization on the artificial intelligence boom, placing it ahead of Apple in market valuation. The company's shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year, reflecting strong investor confidence in its AI-driven strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach due to ongoing economic uncertainties, particularly regarding inflation. The policy statement noted that while economic growth has moderated, the labor market remains solid, and inflation is still above the Fed's 2% target. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is performing well but faces risks, justifying the decision to wait for more data before considering any rate adjustments.

For 60 years, Elwell was a local legend, known for his gruff humor and strict "no substitutions" policy at the cash-only shack he opened in 1965. His passing has prompted an outpouring of tributes from customers and fellow restaurateurs who were inspired by his dedication and work ethic. Elwell became as much of an attraction as his classic burgers, embodying a spirit of small business that defined the neighborhood for decades.</p>

In a recent blog post, he described this advanced AI as a self-teaching system that surpasses human cognition, potentially helping users with everything from personal tasks to solving complex problems. Zuckerberg also emphasized the central role of AI-integrated glasses, like those developed with Ray-Ban, which he believes will become our primary computing devices.

          <p>Figma, the collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, exceeding its anticipated range of $30 to $32. The IPO is set to raise $1.2 billion, valuing the company at $19.3 billion, and its stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FIG." This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory challenges. Figma's successful IPO reflects a gradually reopening market for tech companies and strong revenue growth, with sales increasing by 40% year-over-year in the most recent quarter.

The company's net income more than doubled, and it saw a significant increase in funded customers and total platform assets, which nearly doubled to $279 billion. This strong performance has made Robinhood the top-performing large-cap U.S. tech stock this year, driven by growth in net deposits and higher valuations in equities and crypto.

          <p>This article puts a spotlight on six independent Latin artists who have released critically acclaimed music but may be overlooked by the Latin Grammy Awards. While major stars often dominate the nominations, progressive and forward-thinking albums from artists like Juana Aguirre, Gepe, and Mabe Fratti are pushing creative boundaries. The piece argues that these musicians, who blend traditional folk roots with experimental electronic sounds and complex arrangements, deserve recognition in major categories like Album of the Year. It serves as a call for the Latin Academy to celebrate the innovative work happening outside the mainstream music industry.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026, a decision that effectively keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Running the nation's most populous state while simultaneously pursuing the presidency would have been a formidable challenge, and her decision avoids that political difficulty. In her statement, the former vice president and 2024 nominee did not rule out a future White House bid. Her absence from the gubernatorial race reshapes the contest, which features a crowded field of prominent California Democrats, and allows her to focus on her next steps in public life.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) and UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting have agreed to restart talks following the conclusion of the latest five-day strike by resident doctors in England. Streeting offered to resume negotiations focused on working conditions, though he stated that pay was not on the table. He also warned the union that the recent strike had "squandered the considerable goodwill" it had with the government. The BMA accepted the offer, expressing hope for a tangible settlement. This development marks a potential de-escalation in the long-running dispute that has led to multiple disruptive strikes.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of fans gathered in Birmingham, England, for a funeral procession to honor heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away earlier this month. The Black Sabbath singer's coffin was driven through the city center, pausing at the Black Sabbath Bridge, which has become a memorial site. Osbourne's wife, Sharon, and other family members attended the procession, which was publicly funded by the family to celebrate the life of a man the city's mayor called one of its "greatest living legends." The event was a heartfelt tribute from his hometown to the iconic musician.</p>
