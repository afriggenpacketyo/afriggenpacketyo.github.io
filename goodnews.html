          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling in English waters to protect marine life and habitats. The proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. This move follows warnings from environmental advocates about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on the seabed. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference in Nice, aiming to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>
