        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has announced higher capital gains tax brackets for 2026, adjusting taxable income limits for long-term assets owned over a year. This adjustment also includes increases for federal income tax brackets, estate and gift tax exemptions, and earned income tax credit eligibility. The announcement follows the IRS's disclosure of potential workforce furloughs due to an ongoing government shutdown. For single filers, the 0% long-term capital gains rate applies to taxable income of $49,450 or less, while for married couples filing jointly, the limit is $98,900 or less, with the standard deduction rising to $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners experienced a surge in stock prices after China implemented stricter export regulations, prompting speculation about increased U.S. investment in domestic supply chains. China now requires licenses for foreign entities exporting goods containing 0.1% or more rare earths, and those using Chinese extraction or refining technology. The White House is assessing the impact of these rules, which come before a meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Trump. This move has intensified the focus on rare earths in trade talks, as the U.S. relies heavily on China for these critical inputs used in various industries, including defense and electric vehicles.

          <p>The UK government will now provide free legal advice to all Post Office Horizon scandal victims claiming compensation, potentially increasing payout amounts. This change addresses criticisms of the compensation schemes, which have been slow, complicated, and resulted in low offers. Victims in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) can now access government-funded legal advice to assess fixed sum offers, aligning it with other schemes. The government has also committed to a new appeals process for postmasters who accepted fixed payouts under the HSS scheme, including funded legal advice, and has extended the closure date for the HSS scheme.</p>

          <p>YouTube is introducing a new feature allowing previously terminated creators to apply for a new channel, offering a second chance after a lifetime ban. This decision follows scrutiny from House Republicans and President Trump regarding political bias and content moderation. The new option is separate from the existing appeals process; unsuccessful appellants can now apply for a new channel, starting from scratch without previous videos, subscribers, or monetization. Eligible creators can request a new channel one year after their original termination, with YouTube reviewing requests based on the severity and frequency of past violations, as well as off-platform behavior.</p>

          <h2>Emerson's Guide to Overcoming Collective Illusions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the phenomenon of "collective illusions," where people hold opinions they believe are unique but are widely shared, leading to self-silencing and societal harm. It cites a Populace survey revealing that a majority of Americans feel pressured to conceal their true opinions on sensitive topics. The piece connects this dissonance to negative well-being trends, such as social anxiety and depression, and draws on Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self-Reliance" for guidance on breaking free from these illusions. Emerson's advice includes stopping lying, reframing independence, and distancing oneself from sources of incorrect views, to foster honesty and individual well-being.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene his cabinet to discuss a proposed ceasefire deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, potentially ending the two-year conflict. The deal, based on President Trump's 20-point proposal, was negotiated in Egypt and involves the release of remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Trump announced the agreement's first phase, which includes the release of all hostages and the IDF's withdrawal to the "yellow line" in Gaza. Key Arab and Muslim states have expressed support for the plan, urging Hamas to accept the agreement, though intense strikes across Gaza continue.</p>

Goldman Sachs also included portfolio names Disney and Broadcom on its list of tactical trade ideas heading into earnings season. Analysts anticipate an EPS beat from Disney due to direct-to-consumer profitability and domestic parks, while Broadcom's $110 billion backlog offers visibility for the next two years.
