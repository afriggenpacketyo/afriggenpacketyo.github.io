          <p>The White House celebrated 'Star Wars Day' by posting an AI-generated image of President Donald Trump wielding a red lightsaber, while also criticizing the 'radical left'. The post on X included the image of Trump in a Jedi robe with ripped arms, accompanied by two bald eagles and American flags. The post drew mixed reactions, with some criticizing the use of a red lightsaber, traditionally associated with the dark side in Star Wars lore. The U.S. Army Pacific also commemorated the day with an AI-generated image of soldiers with lightsabers.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for refusing to endorse false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Pence defied Trump by declining to overturn electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during the Congressional session on January 6, 2021. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for 'putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power'.</p>
