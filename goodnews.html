          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a dominant win at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, highlighting a potential resurgence for his team in the championship race. The event was marked by an early crash from championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who made a significant error on the first lap. Piastri's main rival, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize on the mistake, finishing seventh and gaining only a few points in the standings. The race also saw a strong performance from Mercedes' George Russell, who finished second, and a notable podium for Williams with Carlos Sainz taking third.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure has attributed her extensive charity work to her deeply held Christian faith, describing it as a core calling. In a recent interview, the "Full House" star detailed a trip to the Dominican Republic with the nonprofit Free Wheelchair Mission, where she helped distribute wheelchairs to individuals in need. Bure explained that the biblical directive to help "the least of these" is the guiding principle behind her philanthropic efforts. She emphasized that participating in such work is profoundly rewarding, providing a sense of purpose and connection by showing others they are loved and valued.</p>

          <p>China has entered the top 10 of the UN's Global Innovation Index for the first time, an achievement that some analysts argue demonstrates the failure of U.S. tech containment policies. The article suggests that instead of crippling China's technological advancement, U.S. restrictions, such as export controls on semiconductors, have spurred Beijing to increase domestic research and development investment significantly. China's R&D spending exceeded 3.6 trillion yuan in 2024, making it the world's second-largest spender. This strategic shift towards self-sufficiency is seen as a direct response to external pressures from Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former World Cup winner Kat Merchant has advocated for scrum-half Lucy Packer to be included in England's starting lineup for the final against Canada. Despite having started only one game in the tournament, Merchant believes Packer's speed and ball delivery could be a decisive factor for the Red Roses. This move would likely see the more experienced Natasha Hunt move to the bench, where Merchant argues she could make a greater impact in the later stages of the game. The article details the strategic debate among experts regarding England's optimal lineup, also considering changes in the wing and centre positions to counter Canada's strengths.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its investment in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding an exceptionally profitable venture. The stake, originally purchased in 2008 for $230 million at the urging of Charlie Munger, had grown in value by approximately 3,890% over the 17 years it was held. Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022, and a recent financial filing confirmed the position is now valued at zero. While Buffett has praised BYD, his decision to sell aligns with a broader reevaluation of geopolitical risks associated with Chinese investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a significant joint military exercise, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of an aircraft carrier. This departure from typical practice has led to speculation among analysts about its strategic meaning. Some experts suggest the move could be an attempt by Washington to de-escalate tensions and improve relations with China and North Korea. Others interpret it as a reflection of the Trump administration's strategy to push Asian allies to take on greater responsibility for regional security and containment of China within the first island chain.</p>

          <p>Health experts and fertility doctors are calling for sex education in schools to cover not only pregnancy prevention but also the basics of human fertility. Many people, particularly women, reach adulthood with significant misconceptions about their reproductive biology, such as the impact of age on fertility and the factors affecting conception. This lack of knowledge can lead to difficulties in family planning later in life. Proponents argue that a more comprehensive curriculum could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about their health and future, potentially reducing the need for intensive fertility treatments like IVF.</p>

Despite Berlin's reputation as a fast course, the winning times were slower than world records, likely due to unusually warm and humid conditions in the German capital.

          <p>As annual fees for premium travel credit cards like the American Express Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve rise to over $500, financial experts are urging consumers to carefully assess whether the perks justify the cost. These cards offer benefits such as airport lounge access, travel credits, and large sign-on bonuses, which can be valuable for frequent travelers. However, the value of these rewards can be quickly negated by high interest rates if a balance is carried from month to month. Consumers should analyze their personal travel habits and spending patterns to determine if a high-fee card is a worthwhile investment. (not investment advice)</p>
