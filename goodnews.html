          <p>Germany's ruling coalition has unified on key policy matters, backing necessary welfare reforms and a structured approach to the 2027 budget to avoid future disputes. Leaders from the CDU/CSU and SPD presented a united front, emphasizing their commitment to preserving the welfare state through modernization. Separately, Porsche's CEO announced the luxury carmaker's ambition to rejoin Germany's premier DAX stock index soon after its recent relegation to the MDAX, which followed a significant drop in share price due to industry-wide challenges like slowing EV sales and a cooling Chinese market.

          <p>Following a more than 5% drop in Salesforce's stock in extended trading, CEO Marc Benioff described the company's guidance as "appropriately conservative." Despite beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings and revenue, the disappointing future outlook has concerned investors, contributing to a 23% year-to-date decline in the stock. Benioff highlighted customer satisfaction with Salesforce's AI products and recent competitive wins against rivals like Palantir for government contracts, asserting the company offers a superior product at a lower cost.

          <p>Recent diplomatic meetings led by Chinese President Xi Jinping have underscored China's foreign policy focus on promoting a multipolar world order and strengthening economic cooperation. In discussions with various world leaders, Xi has consistently advocated for upholding multilateralism and the international system centered on the United Nations. These remarks are widely interpreted as a veiled critique of the United States' unilateral actions and trade disputes. This diplomatic push reinforces Beijing's strategy to position itself as a leading champion for an alternative to a US-dominated global framework.</p>

          <p>As cars in the U.S. are lasting longer than ever, owners of aging vehicles face a complex decision when repair costs mount. This article explores the journey of a 20-year-old minivan, weighing the options between selling it for scrap, donating it to a charity that provides transportation for families in need, or recycling it. Donating can extend a car's useful life for someone else, while specialized recycling programs ensure that hazardous fluids are managed properly and valuable parts are salvaged for reuse. The process reveals that even at its "end of life," a vehicle can be demanufactured and its components reincarnated.</p>

          <p>The famed "Booked Up" bookstore, founded by the late Pulitzer Prize-winning author Larry McMurtry, has reopened in Archer City, Texas, as the Larry McMurtry Literary Center. After McMurtry's death in 2021, the town lost its main tourist attraction, but the new center aims to preserve his vast book collection and legacy by hosting writer's retreats and events. The revival has been welcomed by local businesses who hope it will bring literary tourists back to the small town that served as the setting for many of his iconic works. The center is now fundraising to repair the historic building.</p>
