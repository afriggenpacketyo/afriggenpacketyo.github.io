        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are bracing for investor scrutiny despite millions of travelers flying for the July 4 holiday, as the industry faces a murky outlook for the rest of the year. Domestic airfare is down 3% from last year, the cheapest since 2021, indicating lower demand despite a resilient broader economy. Major carriers like Southwest and Delta pulled their 2025 forecasts, citing economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariffs and fewer overseas visitors. Analysts observe tepid overall demand, with debit and credit card data showing consistent declines in air travel spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing has fallen, and the pound has risen, partially reversing a surge triggered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves' emotional appearance in Parliament. Markets were initially rattled by speculation about her potential resignation, fearing a loss of fiscal discipline. However, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's strong public backing of Reeves, stating they work 'in lockstep,' appeared to placate investors. Analysts noted that financial markets seem to support the Chancellor, viewing her as crucial for maintaining fiscal stability, which also impacts mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added a stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June, with the unemployment rate decreasing to 4.1%, its lowest since February. This robust performance, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, included significant gains in state and local government, as well as healthcare, while federal jobs continued to decline. The solid job growth, coupled with moderate wage increases, indicates a resilient labor market, which is likely to deter the Federal Reserve from implementing a July interest rate cut. This positive report, defying some earlier weaker indicators, suggests the central bank will take more time to evaluate incoming data before adjusting its benchmark interest rate.

          <p>Catherine, the Princess of Wales, shared her candid experience of cancer recovery, describing it as a 'roller coaster' with unpredictable 'hard times,' during a visit to a cancer support center. She emphasized the challenges of the post-treatment phase, where individuals are no longer under clinical care but struggle to resume normal functioning at home. Princess Kate, who announced her remission in January after preventative chemotherapy, highlighted the invaluable role of support networks. Her remarks shed light on the often-unseen difficulties faced by cancer survivors as they navigate life after treatment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding expectations and demonstrating continued labor market strength despite the ongoing trade war. While the unemployment rate decreased to 4.1%, job gains were concentrated in state government and healthcare, contrasting with continued federal job losses under the Trump administration. Economists have expressed concern that the labor market might be slow to react to the president's tariffs, which have already impacted the stock market. The White House, meanwhile, continues to downplay the tariffs' domestic economic impact while pushing for new trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials noted that a recent mass casualty training exercise at the airport significantly aided the rapid and effective response, ensuring tremendous medical treatment for the injured on scene.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed two landmark housing bills, significantly easing environmental review procedures for urban, multifamily housing developments. This legislative action, aimed at increasing housing production, represents a philosophical shift for state Democrats towards prioritizing material abundance over avoiding development-related conflicts or intra-party tensions. Despite objections from some environmental groups and labor unions, the reforms are seen as vital for combating climate change and conserving ecosystems by encouraging denser urban living. This move could serve as a blueprint for other blue states struggling with housing shortages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of 'lazy summers' for children, reminiscent of earlier decades, faces challenges today due to increased structured activities and ubiquitous digital devices. Experts note that modern kids have less unsupervised downtime and significantly more screen time, with gaming being a predominant activity. While gaming can offer benefits like relationship building and critical thinking, the constant availability of content like YouTube Shorts fundamentally alters unstructured play. The article highlights that older teens are increasingly savvy at managing their device use, but achieving a truly 'wild summer' remains difficult for younger children and working parents.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its stand-alone free streaming TV service, Freevee, in August, as part of a strategic move to consolidate its content offerings under Prime Video. Following the shutdown, Freevee's original series and movies will be available for free within the Prime Video platform, even without a Prime subscription. This decision comes after Amazon introduced advertisements on Prime Video in January 2024, and had telegraphed the move last November. The company aims to provide a simpler and more unified viewing experience for its customers by integrating its ad-supported content into its main streaming service.</p>
