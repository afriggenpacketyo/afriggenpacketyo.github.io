          <p>On a day the S&P 500 reached an all-time high, market commentator Jim Cramer advised taking profits on Broadcom due to its strong performance and reducing the portfolio's position. He expressed confidence in Nvidia, suggesting that positive trade talk developments with China could mitigate concerns over a Chinese antitrust investigation into the company. Cramer also strongly endorsed buying more shares of Boeing, viewing the stock's recent decline as a significant buying opportunity and urging investors to "pound the table" on the aircraft manufacturer. He reiterated that members should own the stock despite recent certification delays for its 777X jet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British actor Stephen Graham won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor for his role in the Netflix drama "Adolescence." In a heartfelt acceptance speech, Graham described himself as "just a mixed-race kid from Kirkby" and expressed profound humility, stating that such an honor shows that "any dream is possible." The 52-year-old star, known for his intense performances in works like "This Is England," thanked his family, particularly his wife Hannah Walters, whom he called his "rock" and "soulmate." His win was a major moment at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, celebrating a career that began at Liverpool's Everyman Youth Theatre.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The agreement was reached during trade talks in Madrid and is set to be finalized by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American division or face a nationwide ban over national security concerns. While details are pending, the deal is expected to pave the way for U.S. ownership of the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>An alliance of nearly 200 shipping companies is urging the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to adopt the first-ever global fee on greenhouse gas emissions to accelerate the industry's transition to greener fuels. The Getting to Zero Coalition is pushing for the regulations to be adopted at a meeting next month, arguing it provides certainty for investments in clean technology. However, the Trump administration has voiced strong opposition, labeling the proposal a "global carbon tax on Americans" and threatening retaliation against nations that support it. The shipping industry is responsible for about 3% of global emissions, and this proposal marks a critical juncture in its decarbonization efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following a more than 4% surge in its stock price. The milestone places it in an elite club alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The stock's recent rally was significantly boosted by a favorable antitrust ruling where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared. Despite facing increased competition from AI challengers and intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen over 30% this year, demonstrating strong investor confidence in its market position and future prospects.</p>

          <h2>Renewable Sources Identified as Most Cost-Effective Form of Energy Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows onshore wind is the most affordable, followed closely by solar, while fossil fuels and nuclear power are significantly more expensive to generate. Experts note that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are extremely low, unlike fossil fuels which require ongoing fuel purchases. The report also considers the impact of the Trump administration's policies, including phasing out clean energy tax credits and imposing tariffs that could increase costs for projects reliant on imports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate this week for the first time since 2024, signaling a shift in monetary policy. For consumers, this could bring relief from high borrowing costs, though the immediate impact on credit card rates may be minimal. Financial experts advise prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt now rather than waiting for small rate adjustments. They also suggest savers lock in current high yields on savings accounts and CDs before rates fall, and note that lower mortgage rates could help unfreeze the housing market.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares, his first open-market buy since 2020. The significant acquisition is being interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, causing the stock to jump more than 6%. Tesla's shares have faced challenges this year due to falling sales, increased competition, and the end of some U.S. tax breaks for electric cars. The purchase comes as Musk seeks greater control of the company to steer its focus toward AI, robotics, and a proposed robotaxi network. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant boost for the progressive candidate. In a New York Times op-ed, Hochul described Mamdani as a leader focused on affordability, despite their previous disagreements on policy, particularly his proposal to tax the wealthy. The endorsement is a notable development as Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, has faced resistance from the Democratic establishment. His commanding lead in the polls ahead of the November election has positioned him as the frontrunner against incumbent Eric Adams and former governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
