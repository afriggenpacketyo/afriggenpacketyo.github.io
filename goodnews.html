        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK job market is experiencing a gradual slowdown, with official figures from the Office for National Statistics indicating a 5.8% drop in job openings across most industries between May and July. This suggests that some companies are either not recruiting new workers or are not replacing those who have left, contributing to a cooling trend. Despite this, the slowdown is less sharp than some economists anticipated, with average wage growth remaining at 5% and the unemployment rate stable. The article also notes the impact of recent increases in the National Living Wage and employer National Insurance contributions on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The resort remains committed to its S$6.8 billion expansion and investment plans, having already opened new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium in 2025. Lee emphasized a strategic shift towards experiences over shopping, aiming to transform the resort into a premium lifestyle destination with future launches including Super Nintendo World.</p>

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced this peace mission, emphasizing its dual objectives: securing peace within Myanmar and delivering immediate humanitarian assistance to the suffering Rohingya refugees, over a million of whom reside in Bangladesh. The initiative aims to address the escalating conflict and targeted violence against the Rohingya, which has forced a significant exodus.

          <p>The United States and China have successfully extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, averting a looming escalation in tariffs between the world's two largest economies. President Trump formalized the extension, ensuring that US levies on Chinese imports remain at 30% and China's tariffs on American goods stay at 10%. This prolonged pause is intended to facilitate further negotiations focused on rectifying trade imbalances, addressing alleged unfair trade practices, and increasing market access for US exporters. Despite the temporary relief, some business owners voice concerns about the persistent uncertainty that continues to hinder long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Paris's Seine River has opened three designated public bathing sites, attracting thousands of eager tourists and residents, particularly as the region experiences a significant heatwave with temperatures soaring. This landmark development is the culmination of a substantial €1.4 billion cleanup project that restored the river's water quality to a level suitable for last year's Olympic competitions, overcoming a long history of pollution. Daily water quality monitoring and safety protocols, including mandatory buoys and vigilant lifeguards, ensure a safe experience. Despite some initial public skepticism, visitors are enthusiastically embracing this unique urban swimming opportunity.</p>

          <p>Prolific football striker Robert Lewandowski has disclosed that he "said yes" to a potential transfer to Manchester United in 2012, during his highly successful tenure at Borussia Dortmund. Despite his strong desire to play under manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Dortmund ultimately declined to sell him, prioritizing their financial gain by retaining their key player for additional seasons. Although a move to the Premier League never materialized, Lewandowski has forged an illustrious career with top clubs like Bayern Munich and Barcelona, achieving significant success. Now 37, he remains an elite player, attributing a pivotal, life-changing conversation with former coach Jurgen Klopp to his personal and professional growth.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Lula da Silva engaged in a phone conversation, initiated by Lula, during which President Xi underscored the robust state of bilateral relations and urged for greater unity and self-reliance among nations of the Global South. This significant call took place against the backdrop of ongoing US trade tensions, particularly Washington's recent extension of a 90-day pause on tariffs for Chinese goods, which presents a notable contrast in trade policy compared to Brazil. Lula reportedly consulted his senior ministers regarding the potential impact of new US trade measures prior to the discussion, indicating a strategic effort to navigate complex global economic dynamics and foster stronger alliances.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian firm named Wild Hornets has released footage demonstrating its Sting interceptor drone achieving speeds of up to 195 miles per hour in stable flight, positioning it as one of the fastest first-person-view combat drones. This remarkable speed is critical for effectively chasing down and neutralizing Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions, which Russia is increasingly deploying in large volumes to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Sting, costing just $2,500 per unit, is already in active combat deployment and has reportedly accounted for the destruction of approximately 100 Shahed drones. Ukraine harbors ambitious plans to significantly scale up production, aiming to build 1,000 interceptor drones daily to fortify its aerial defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, who has served as the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, is set to depart at the end of the year to pursue new entrepreneurial ventures, leaving the company without an immediate successor. His resignation occurs as GitHub navigates an increasingly competitive landscape within the rapidly expanding market for AI-powered coding tools. While GitHub's Copilot, introduced in 2021, initially provided a significant advantage, numerous fast-growing competitors have since emerged, offering sophisticated AI models capable of rapidly generating code. Despite this intensifying competition, Microsoft continues to report substantial growth for Copilot, with CEO Satya Nadella envisioning a future where billions of AI agents empower a billion developers in a new software "gold rush."</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has urged government intervention to address "neijuan," or excessive internal competition, within the nation's e-commerce sector. His call emphasizes curbing "excessive cash burn" rather than suppressing competition, advocating for policy guidance that carefully balances regulatory oversight with fostering innovation. Wang highlighted that the rapid delivery "quick commerce" model presents crucial opportunities for boosting consumption and driving long-term economic growth. He articulated that the ultimate objective should be to elevate competition to a "higher level," transitioning from a zero-sum mindset towards a collaborative "win-win approach" achieved through quality enhancements and a more robust industrial ecosystem.

          <h2>Nepal Offers Free Mountain Climbing Permits to Boost Remote Tourism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 21:55:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nepal is implementing a new initiative to waive permit fees for 97 of its Himalayan mountains for the next two years, with the strategic goal of stimulating tourism in its more remote and less developed Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This policy stands in contrast to the rising permit fees for Mount Everest, which are set to increase to $15,000 during peak season. While mountaineering is a substantial revenue generator for Nepal, the historically low interest in these remote peaks suggests underlying infrastructure and accessibility challenges. The move also complements a proposed law that would require Everest aspirants to first summit a 7,000m peak, potentially positioning these newly accessible mountains as ideal training grounds.</p>
