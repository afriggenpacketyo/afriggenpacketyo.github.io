          <p>Following its successful initial public offering, financial commentator Jim Cramer has recommended buying stock in the Swedish online lender Klarna. Despite a significant price increase on its first day of trading, Cramer believes the company is not overvalued, pointing to its solid growth and improving fundamentals. He highlighted Klarna's diverse revenue streams beyond its well-known "buy now, pay later" service and praised its impressive automated underwriting standards. Cramer expressed optimism about the company's path toward profitability and its potential for further growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate housing construction, California state lawmakers have introduced legislation to significantly reform Measure ULA, Los Angeles's so-called "mansion tax." The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties, which critics claim have been negatively impacted by the original measure. Proponents argue the changes will incentivize new development, while some supporters of the original measure fear it will devastate funding for crucial affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer observed that the current market sentiment mirrors the show's early days, with a renewed investor enthusiasm for individual stocks. He recalled how the program helped democratize market information for the public before the dot-com bubble burst, which led many to favor safer index funds. Cramer suggests that after years of caution, investors are once again recognizing the potential for significant rewards in single stocks, driven by high-performing companies in sectors like data centers and AI, signaling a welcome return to form.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Harry Brook, labeled the rain-shortened T20 match against South Africa a "shambles of a night" after his team's loss in Cardiff. Multiple weather delays resulted in a heavily modified game, with South Africa batting for 7.5 overs and England facing a revised target in just five overs. Brook expressed frustration with the inconsistent playing conditions, stating that little could be learned from such a disjointed contest. The loss puts England 1-0 down in the three-match series against the visiting South African team.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate 'Dark DNA' to Understand Peacock Spiders' Rich Diversity</h2>

          <p>Scientists are studying Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Researchers believe the key may lie in the spiders' vast amount of "dark DNA," the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. The team hypothesizes that this dark DNA, which is three times more abundant in these spiders than in humans, enables them to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. This research is part of the broader Earth BioGenome Project, which aims to decode the DNA of all known species.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House voted with bipartisan support to repeal the legal authorizations for the 1991 and 2003 wars in Iraq. The measure, backed by both Democrats and Republicans, is an effort by Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over declaring war, which lawmakers argue has been abused by multiple presidential administrations. Proponents contended that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk misuse for military actions unrelated to their original intent. The amendment is attached to the annual defense spending bill, though similar efforts have stalled in the past.</p>

The data also shows an overall 4% decrease in U.S. deaths compared to the previous year, with declines observed across most demographic groups.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials, thereby allowing a transgender boy to continue using the boys' restroom at his public school. This ruling keeps a federal appeals court's injunction in place while the student's lawsuit against a state ban proceeds. The state policy in question prohibits transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity. While the court's order is not a final ruling on the merits of the case, it represents a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the student and LGBTQ+ advocates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service has reversed its decades-long policy and will now provide N95 respirator masks to federal firefighters battling wildfires. The agency had previously banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, despite their common use in other countries and growing evidence of long-term health risks from smoke inhalation, including cancer. The decision follows a series of media reports and pressure from lawmakers criticizing the agency for neglecting firefighter health. This policy change is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the serious health hazards posed by wildfire smoke.</p>

He argued that future consumer demand and blockbuster sales will depend more on incremental but significant software advancements rather than major physical redesigns. Stankey specifically pointed to artificial intelligence as the key area where Apple must deliver compelling and unique features to drive engagement and convince users to upgrade. Without a major leap forward in AI, he does not expect new models to generate the record-breaking launch-day demand seen in the past.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A more than 40% surge in Oracle's stock price, fueled by a positive outlook for its cloud infrastructure and AI businesses, pushed Ellison's net worth to $393 billion. However, as Oracle's shares moderated later in the day, Musk, whose wealth is primarily tied to Tesla, reclaimed the top spot. This momentary shift highlights the dynamic nature of wealth at the highest levels, heavily influenced by daily stock market fluctuations.</p>

In a recent interview, Wintour called the film a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Streep's "fantastic" performance. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, uncertain of what to expect, but ultimately found the portrayal to be acceptable, just in time for the film's upcoming sequel.</p>
