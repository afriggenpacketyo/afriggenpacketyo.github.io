          <h2>Mortgage Demand Surges Despite Economic Uncertainty as Interest Rates Dip Slightly</h2>

          <p>Despite lingering economic uncertainty, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11% due to a slight drop in mortgage interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for home purchases also rose 11% and were 13% higher than the same week last year, driven by demand for conventional loans. Refinance applications increased by 11% as well, with VA loans showing a significant rise. The article notes that the housing market has been slow, with potential buyers hesitant due to economic concerns, and Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting could influence mortgage rates further.

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, anticipating a reduction in the availability of compounded alternatives. First-quarter sales of Wegovy were lower than expected, leading to a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast. The FDA's decision to end a drug shortage ruling, which allowed compounding pharmacies to produce copies of Wegovy, is expected to boost Novo Nordisk's sales. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to improve access to Wegovy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Gunners will attempt to overcome a 1-0 deficit against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-final. Arsenal has not won major silverware since the FA Cup in 2020.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages. The change aims to open up opportunities for school or college leavers and improve rail services. Research from the Rail Safety and Standards Board indicates that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The government believes new jobs and apprenticeships could become available as early as December, with training taking between one and two years.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered genetic secrets in the roots of upland rice that are linked to drought resistance. The researchers identified a gene, HMGB1, that obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots, which are crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could transform widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties, enhancing food security.</p>
