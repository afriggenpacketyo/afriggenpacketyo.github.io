          <p>A California family is suing Harrison-Ross Mortuary after discovering the wrong man in their uncle's casket, dressed in his clothes. Amentha Hunt noticed the error while preparing her uncle, Otis Adkinson, for burial, but was initially dismissed by a mortuary worker. The family waited three hours for the mix-up to be resolved, and the funeral home denies the allegations. Hunt says she remains traumatized by the incident, while her attorney emphasizes the need for improved standards of care at the mortuary. </p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. Nature Conservation Cymru hopes that by feeding the voles glitter-covered apples, they can track the animals' movements through their feces. The glitter is biodegradable and vet-approved, ensuring it is harmless to the voles. This innovative approach will help conservationists understand the voles' territory and habitat use, informing measures to protect and support their dispersal. </p>

          <p>Palaeontologists are investigating a mass grave of Pachyrhinosaurus dinosaurs at Pipestone Creek in Alberta, Canada, seeking to understand how thousands of these animals died simultaneously 72 million years ago. The site contains one of the largest bone beds in North America, with up to 300 bones per square meter. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a migrating herd that perished in a catastrophic flash flood. The team is also studying Edmontosaurus fossils found nearby to build a broader picture of the ancient ecosystem. </p>
