          <p>Air traffic controllers urgently instructed a Spirit Airlines flight to alter its course to avoid proximity to Air Force One over Long Island, New York. The Spirit flight was traveling from Fort Lauderdale to Boston, while Air Force One was carrying President Trump to the United Kingdom. Controllers repeatedly told the Spirit pilots to turn, with one controller quipping, "Pay attention. Get off the iPad." The FAA stated that a preliminary investigation showed the aircraft maintained the required separation, and Spirit Airlines affirmed that its flight followed procedures and ATC instructions.</p>

          <p>Mortgage refinance applications jumped 58% last week due to a drop in interest rates to the lowest level since October of last year. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.39% from 6.49%, leading homeowners to seek more savings amid economic uncertainty. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) saw a particularly strong increase, with their share of activity reaching the highest level since 2008. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes also rose, but not as dramatically, increasing by 3% for the week.</p>

          <p>Cade Horton, a Chicago Cubs rookie, pitched five innings, allowing one run and striking out six in a win against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Horton's performance marked his eighth win in his last 11 starts, during which he only allowed six runs. This achievement puts him in the company of Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, who accomplished a similar feat in 1968. Horton's ERA stands at 2.66 with 95 strikeouts in 21 starts this year, and the Cubs improved to 87-64 with the victory.</p>

          <h2>Federal Benefit Payments Transitioning to Electronic Delivery</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is phasing out paper checks for Social Security benefits and other federal payments this month, transitioning to electronic payments. This move, prompted by an executive order, aims to prevent fraud and reduce spending, as electronic transfers are cheaper and less prone to theft or loss. While most beneficiaries already receive payments electronically, those still receiving paper checks can enroll in direct deposit or opt for a Treasury-sponsored debit card. The transition may present challenges for some beneficiaries, particularly those who are homeless, disabled, or unbanked.</p>

          <p>The Arbovirus-Entomology Laboratory in Texas is actively monitoring mosquitoes to track and contain vector-borne diseases, a critical effort given the state's vulnerability due to its climate and population. Texas spends $755,000 annually on its arbovirus surveillance program, monitoring mosquito populations, species, and pathogens. While the US has successfully driven away some mosquito-borne diseases, there is a resurgence of old diseases and the emergence of new ones. The state is also contending with dengue and West Nile virus outbreaks, highlighting the need for a holistic strategy to combat disease-spreading mosquitoes.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the unconventional 1990s romance between Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra with the mainstream engagement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Rodman and Electra's brief, chaotic marriage challenged traditional relationship norms and racial codes, while Swift and Kelce represent a more conventional, algorithm-friendly version of American romance. The author notes that Rodman and Electra's relationship, though turbulent, offered visibility for misfits and those who didn't fit traditional beauty standards. The comparison highlights how celebrity love affairs reflect evolving cultural values and societal expectations.</p>

          <p>German basketball is experiencing a golden era, with the national team winning the Eurobasket crown and domestic basketball thriving.

The BBL has a 6+6 regulation, requiring at least six German players on the roster, and while some players are leaving for the NCAA, the BBL remains committed to its current rules.</p>
