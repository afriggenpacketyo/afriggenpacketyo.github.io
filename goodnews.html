          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a $140 million state investment to keep 109 Planned Parenthood clinics operational, directly countering federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. This financial support aims to prevent the closure of clinics and the elimination of primary care services in several counties, ensuring continued access to healthcare, including abortion services. The move makes California the fourth state to use public funds to support the organization amid nationwide Republican efforts to defund it. Planned Parenthood officials expressed gratitude for the state's intervention, which they described as a necessary step to weather the financial impact of federal policies.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, a significant show of support just before the start of early voting. Jeffries stated his respect for the electoral process and Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis as key reasons for his endorsement of the entire citywide Democratic ticket. This backing adds to a growing list of endorsements for Mamdani from prominent Democrats, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, recently received the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, setting the stage for a contentious general election.</p>

          <p>High-level trade talks between the United States and China have begun in Kuala Lumpur, with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng meeting US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This meeting is viewed as a crucial preparatory step for a potential summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, aimed at easing escalating economic tensions. The discussions are expected to cover critical issues in the bilateral trade relationship, which has been strained by recent tariff threats from the Trump administration. This marks the fifth face-to-face meeting between the two economic officials since President Trump intensified the trade war earlier in the year, with a temporary truce set to expire soon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit represents a symbolic and carefully planned effort to reset diplomatic relations between the two nations. While significant immediate breakthroughs are not anticipated, the visit is seen as an important gesture toward improving ties that have been strained in recent years. This trip is contrasted with Xi's 2014 visit, which occurred during a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations and resulted in a free-trade agreement. The current diplomatic climate is more complex, with past discussions on Korean unification and denuclearization having yielded mixed results, making this visit a key moment for future cooperation.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has nearly doubled since 2000, growing from 35.3 million to 68 million and now constituting one in five Americans. This growth, which accounts for over half of the total U.S. population increase in that period, has been driven by both births and immigration. The report highlights that U.S. Latinos are the youngest major ethnic group with a median age of 31, and a large majority (79%) are U.S. citizens. People of Mexican origin remain the largest subgroup, while states like California and Texas have the largest Latino populations, reflecting significant demographic shifts across the country.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen set the fastest time during Friday practice for the Mexico City Grand Prix, putting pressure on championship rivals at McLaren. Verstappen, who has been in strong form recently, topped the session ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, while McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished fourth and twelfth, respectively. Despite his single-lap pace, Verstappen expressed significant concern over his car's lack of grip and poor performance during longer race-simulation runs. Norris also noted that McLaren was "a little bit behind" and would need to work on improving the car's balance ahead of qualifying and the race.</p>

          <p>An aggressive sea otter is once more approaching surfers and their boards at Santa Cruz's Steamer Lane, echoing the behavior of the famous otter 841 from two years ago. It is unclear if this is the same animal, as the current otter lacks the identifying flipper tag that 841 wore, which may have broken off or been removed. The behavior is nearly identical, with the otter actively pursuing surfers and, in one recent case, biting a surfer and stealing her board. Federal wildlife officials, who previously attempted to capture 841, have not yet announced plans to intervene, while the recurring phenomenon continues to captivate local observers and the surfing community.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% that economists had predicted. This data was released by the Department of Labor despite the ongoing government shutdown, as it is necessary for calculating the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Economists suggest that while President Trump's tariffs have exerted some upward pressure on prices, the full impact on consumers has been partially absorbed by businesses. The report complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, but analysts believe the benign data still supports expectations for another rate cut to address a slowing job market.

          <p>As the UK prepares for the clocks to go back, mental health experts are highlighting strategies to cope with the reduced daylight, which can trigger Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) in over a million people. Symptoms of this recurring seasonal depression include low mood, anxiety, and sluggishness. To counter these effects, a project at the University of Glasgow is promoting new 'light routines' and an 'attitudinal shift' toward winter, encouraging outdoor activity and redesigning interior spaces to be more welcoming. In Orkney, Scotland, where winter daylight is scarcest, libraries are now lending therapeutic lamps as part of 'Wintering Well' boxes to help residents manage their mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Treasury Select Committee has strongly recommended that Chancellor Rachel Reeves refrain from cutting the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs in the upcoming November Budget. In a report, the committee argued that reducing the £20,000 annual limit would be unlikely to achieve the goal of encouraging savers to move their money into stocks and shares. The recommendation comes as the Chancellor faces a significant budget shortfall and is reportedly considering the cut to promote a broader investment culture. Savers currently hold £360 billion in cash ISAs, and campaigners have voiced strong opposition to the potential change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The growing prevalence of electric vehicles, which are all automatic, is influencing how new drivers in the UK approach learning to drive. While passing a test in a manual car allows one to drive both types, many learners are opting for automatic-only licenses, hoping for a quicker path to passing. However, challenges such as a shortage of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs are complicating the decision for many. DVSA data shows that despite a common perception, the pass rate is actually higher for manual tests. This shift reflects the broader transition in the automotive industry as the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales approaches.</p>

          <p>Counting is set to get underway in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election, following polls closing on Friday. Voters chose between two main contenders, independent Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, to replace the outgoing head of state, Michael D Higgins. A third candidate's name remained on the ballot despite his withdrawal from the race. Ballot boxes will be opened Saturday morning, with a final result expected to be announced from Dublin Castle in the evening. Early indications suggest that voter turnout may be low, potentially failing to surpass the record low of just under 40% set in the 2018 presidential election.</p>
