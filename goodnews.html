          <h2>Dogs Trained to Detect Spotted Lanternfly Eggs Help Combat Invasive Pest in the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are deploying specially trained dogs to sniff out egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly in the Cleveland area, helping to eradicate the sap-sucking bugs that damage trees and fruit crops. Four dogs have uncovered over 4,000 egg masses, potentially eliminating up to 200,000 lanternflies, with the dogs trained through a Virginia Tech University project. The dogs, owned by local residents, receive treats for spotting egg masses, which are then scraped away, with female lanternflies laying eggs from late August through the first frost. This initiative aims to slow the spread of the insect, which is native to eastern Asia.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements received by former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, alleging without evidence that some celebrities were illegally paid for their endorsements. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Bruce Springsteen, and Beyonce appeared at Harris campaign events, with the campaign paying their production companies for services. Winfrey and Beyonce's mother denied that the payments were for endorsements, but rather for production costs, and campaign law experts stated that there are no FEC regulations against campaigns paying celebrities for endorsements as long as payments are properly disclosed.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor's degree in philosophy after being released from immigration custody, where he was detained for allegedly posing a risk of "adverse foreign policy consequences". Mahdawi, who has a green card, was released by a Vermont federal judge who deemed his detention a punishment for protected speech, and plans to return to Columbia for a graduate degree. The Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi under a law allowing visa revocation if the secretary of state believes someone's presence poses "serious adverse foreign policy consequences," with Mahdawi arguing his detention violated the First Amendment.</p>

Crystal Palace's FA Cup win secures them a spot in the Europa League, with the complication arising from Newcastle's potential qualification for various European competitions.

          <p>An inspection of the Brooklyn Bridge determined that the structure did not sustain any significant damage after a Mexican navy sailing ship collided with it, killing two people on board. The New York City Department of Transportation confirmed the lack of structural damage, and the NTSB's bridge team is working with NYC DOT to assess the incident. Preliminary investigation suggests that the ship, Cuauht√©moc, was leaving New York City when it struck the bridge, with the NTSB launching a full investigation to gather perishable evidence, which may take 12 to 24 months to complete.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling declared DOGE's actions at USIP "null and void" and ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. The judge noted that Trump used force and "threats of criminal process" to take over the USIP headquarters, even though the agency is not part of the government's executive branch. The USIP, in a statement, said that the group for 40 years "has worked to spread peace and stability around the world."</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations that covers fishing, trade, defense, energy, and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. The agreement involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks.</p>

          <p>Cruel World, a Goldenvoice celebration of postpunk, new wave, and alternative music, took place at Brookside at the Rose Bowl, with New Order and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds headlining. The festival ran smoothly, even in the rain, creating a vibe reminiscent of England‚Äôs famed Glastonbury Festival. Standout performances included New Order, Devo, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Garbage, while The Go-Go's performance was considered uncoordinated and plagued by sound issues. The performances ranged from nostalgic highs to moments of disappointment, highlighting the varied experiences at the festival.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has joined President Donald Trump as he signed a bill into law that makes posting so-called "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content illegal. The Take It Down Act criminalizes posting "intimate images" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. The first lady described the new law as a "national victory that will help parents and families protect children from online exploitation", though some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship.</p>

After helping Liverpool secure the Premier League title on 27 April, Salah said: "Hopefully I'm going to break [the goal involvements record] soon.
