          <h2>Opinion Piece Explores the Link Between Therapy Culture and Declining Birth Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 19:30:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece discusses a possible connection between the rise of therapy culture and the declining birth rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that an increased focus on individual trauma and the redefinition of harm have led to impossibly high standards for parenting, making younger generations hesitant to have children. The piece also touches on other plausible explanations, such as financial concerns, career aspirations, and climate change anxieties, but emphasizes the impact of redefined standards for parenting. This shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, which may cause younger generations to dread parenthood because they feel they cannot meet the high standards that they hold their own parents to.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer a set of historic photos depicting enslaved people to the International African American Museum in South Carolina. The agreement concludes a 15-year legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of two people shown in the 1850 images. The photos, commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for discredited research, will now be placed in a museum where the people depicted were enslaved. This decision is part of a broader public debate about how universities should address their historical ties to slavery.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins dominated discussions at Bitcoin 2025, highlighting their growing importance in finance and politics. Vice President JD Vance endorsed crypto, stating stablecoins strengthen U.S. economic power, and White House official Bo Hines said integrating stablecoins could unlock trillions in demand for American debt. Senator Cynthia Lummis announced a Senate bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers is nearing a vote, and Representative Bryan Steil is working on companion legislation in the House. The SEC is also dismantling its enforcement-first framework, paving the way for greater institutional participation in crypto.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 130 retired judges have filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents on allegations that she prevented the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an egregious overreach by the executive branch that threatens public trust in the judicial system.</p>

Trump lauded Musk as one of the greatest business leaders and innovators, noting his contributions to government reform. While Musk's promise to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget fell short, the White House claims DOGE saved roughly $170 billion. Despite Musk's departure, Trump indicated he will remain involved, with many DOGE personnel staying on.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer. The trial showed that the drug pembrolizumab, when administered before and after surgery, doubled the time patients were cancer-free. This breakthrough offers hope for patients with a difficult-to-treat cancer, as there has been little change in treatment methods for two decades. The new approach reduced the risk of cancer returning elsewhere in the body and has given patients like Laura Marston a new lease on life.</p>
