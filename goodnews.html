          <p>A 13-year-old from New Hampshire, Jackson Denio, caught a massive 177-pound Atlantic halibut during a deep-sea fishing trip, a fish that significantly outweighs him. The catch, made off the New England coast, is considered a once-in-a-lifetime event for the region, as halibut of this size are rare in the Atlantic. After a 30-minute fight, Denio successfully reeled in the fish, which may set a new junior world record. His family plans to submit the catch to the International Game Fish Association for official recognition.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party conference demonstrates a significant expansion in the party's scale and ambition, transitioning from a fringe movement to a major political gathering. The event, held at Birmingham's NEC, combines an insurgent, anti-establishment energy with the professional infrastructure of a mainstream party, a unique and challenging combination. Led by Nigel Farage, the party is rapidly building a national network and attracting a diverse group of new members, many of whom are disaffected former Conservative and Labour voters. The conference's central theme, "The Next Step," underscores the party's clear objective of becoming a dominant force in British politics.</p>

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire governor of Illinois, is increasingly taking on a prominent role within the national Democratic Party. Known for his wealth and willingness to self-fund political initiatives, Pritzker successfully brought the Democratic National Convention to Chicago and has become a vocal critic of Donald Trump. He has been positioning himself as a strong, combative leader for the party, contrasting his style with others in the Democratic leadership. The article suggests that despite a recent shift in wealth rankings compared to Trump, Pritzker's political influence and ambition continue to grow significantly.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a significant reshuffle of his government, with major changes at the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office. The shake-up, prompted by Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, aims to reset the government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration. Several ministers have been moved to new departments, and new appointments include business leader Jason Stockwood to a minister post, intended to bring more private sector experience into the government. The reshuffle reflects Starmer's attempt to regain political momentum after a difficult week for his premiership.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the site for his future presidential library and museum. A 13-person board, comprising former aides and political allies like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, has been established to oversee the project and lead fundraising efforts. While Biden has deep roots in Pennsylvania, the decision honors Delaware as the state that launched and sustained his long political career. The project aims to create a space for history and civic leadership, though it faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate.</p>

          <p>A new chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore, as a dozen organic dairy and cattle ranches have agreed to a multi-million dollar buyout to cease operations on the land. This landmark settlement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a massive five-year ecological restoration project. The plan aims to restore native grasslands and improve biodiversity, in part by using targeted cattle grazing to manage invasive plant species. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, conservationists see it as a critical opportunity to heal the landscape and create a model for future environmental stewardship.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a historic Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, an event seen as a symbol of growing acceptance within the Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to marginalized groups. Participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming tone, a stark contrast to the feeling of being shunned during previous Holy Years. The pilgrimage, officially listed on the Vatican's calendar, represents a significant moment of hope and recognition for LGBTQ+ individuals within the global Catholic community.</p>

          <p>In response to new state mandates and growing concerns about classroom distractions, school districts across the U.S. are implementing locked magnetic pouches to manage student cellphone use. Companies like Yondr provide pouches that students carry, which are locked upon entering the school and can only be opened at designated magnetic unlocking stations. While some students and educators welcome the change, citing improved focus and social interaction, others have expressed frustration and devised ways to circumvent the system. The policy has sparked debate over cost and effectiveness, but millions of students are now part of this growing "phone-free" school movement.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal conflicts. The discovery in a South Carolina forest has launched what experts are calling "the ultimate cold case," as a team of forensic genealogists works to identify the fallen soldiers. By extracting DNA from the 240-year-old bones and building genetic profiles, researchers are matching them against living descendants. This remarkable effort aims to restore the names and stories of these forgotten patriots, who were hastily buried on the battlefield and lost to history until now.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system this Sunday, sending a message to millions of mobile phones. The system is designed to warn the public about life-threatening events such as extreme weather or terror attacks. The alert will cause compatible phones to vibrate and emit a loud siren sound for approximately 10 seconds. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced several technical issues, which the government has since promised to resolve. Users can opt out of receiving these alerts through their phone's settings.</p>
