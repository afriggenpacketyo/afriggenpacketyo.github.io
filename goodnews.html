The report, which criticizes America's food supply, pesticides, and prescription drugs, cited hundreds of studies, but some of these studies appear not to exist or were misinterpreted. The White House stated that the report will be updated to address formatting and citation errors, though it maintains confidence in the report's substance and Kennedy's leadership.</p>

The Trump administration had threatened to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on hold. The appeals court's decision provides temporary relief for the administration as it argues that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed after the release of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing and requires Japan to register fishery processing facilities with Chinese authorities. It also mandates inspection and certification of seafood to confirm the absence of radioactive substances. The move follows China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
