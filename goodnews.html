          <p>Restaurateur Tommy Fello, who lost movement in his left side after a stroke, has experienced significant recovery thanks to a new medical device called the Vivistim System. After traditional therapy yielded minimal results, Fello received the FDA-approved implant, which uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself. Developed by MicroTransponder Inc., the technology has helped Fello regain substantial function and reduce pain in his arm. Neurosurgeons believe this first-of-its-kind technology could redefine recovery possibilities for many of the 800,000 Americans who suffer ischemic strokes annually.</p>

          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down to younger generations, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize family conflict and tax burdens. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death to take advantage of a "step-up in basis," which reduces capital gains taxes for heirs. Using legal structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can also protect the property from lawsuits and creditors. A well-drafted operating agreement for the LLC can outline rules for usage, expenses, and potential buyouts, preventing common disputes among siblings over inherited homes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the concept of "wardrobe diplomacy" through Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit with President Trump. After a previous combative meeting where his casual attire was criticized, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black canvas blazer, a move interpreted as a signal for serious conversation. The change in attire was noted positively by both President Trump and the press, potentially contributing to a more successful meeting. The article draws parallels to Winston Churchill's strategic use of clothing during WWII, suggesting that what political leaders wear can send powerful, non-verbal messages during high-stakes diplomatic engagements.</p>

The move addresses long-term investor frustration over the company's stagnant stock performance and underwhelming growth over the past decade. The new directors, John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison, bring extensive medtech experience and are expected to help guide portfolio management, M&A opportunities, and margin improvement. This strategic overhaul signals that Medtronic's management is actively working to create a process for sustainable, long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful and costly hurricanes, Florida communities are exploring new strategies for resilient rebuilding. Some residents are moving inland to master-planned towns like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features and survived Hurricane Ian with minimal damage. In coastal areas like Miami, city programs and non-profits are helping low-income residents rebuild their homes at higher elevations with hurricane-resistant materials. Despite the clear return on investment for mitigation efforts, federal support for such projects is declining under the Trump administration, posing a significant challenge to the state's long-term preparedness.</p>

          <p>Coventry City FC has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society (CBS) Arena, its home stadium, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that safeguards the club's future and signals a new era of ambition and stability. For years, supporters have endured uncertainty with multiple stadium owners and periods of playing at different grounds since leaving their original home in 2005. Owning the arena allows the club to invest in facilities and fan experience, ending a long and difficult period for the team and its community.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents, arguing that the establishment has grown complacent and out of touch. These challengers, frustrated by what they see as a failure to act with urgency against the Trump administration, are pushing for new energy, vision, and a more aggressive political strategy. While incumbents defend their records and experience, the insurgents claim the party is "sleepwalking into dystopia" and needs a full-scale reimagining to reconnect with voters, especially younger generations and people of color.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has officially graduated from high school, fulfilling a lifelong goal that was derailed by severe abuse he suffered at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. In the 1960s, Horne was sent to the state-run reform school, where he endured vicious beatings that caused him to fall behind and eventually drop out to support his family. He earned his diploma through a new state compensation program for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne hopes his story of perseverance inspires others who have faced significant setbacks in their lives.</p>

          <p>Dermatologists are increasingly recommending tinted sunscreens for their ability to protect against visible light, a benefit not offered by most standard sunscreens. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key protective ingredient is iron oxide, which gives tinted products their color and is effective at blocking this type of radiation. While the focus of sun protection has traditionally been on preventing skin cancer from UV rays, experts emphasize the importance of addressing these other conditions and the psychosocial impact they can have.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed erupting at its summit, shooting fountains of lava up to 100 feet high within its Halemaumau crater. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to homes. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma is being forced to the surface through a consistent pathway, creating repeated displays of molten rock. The eruption offers a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and is being live-streamed by the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>

          <p>After a five-year legal battle initiated by residents, a street in central Berlin will finally be renamed to honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate in 1734. The street, previously named "Mohrenstrasse" or "Moor Street," has long been criticized by activists for its racist connotations, stemming from the 18th-century practice of enslaving Africans as "court moors." Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana before being brought to Germany, where he became a respected philosopher. The renaming is seen as a significant, though long-overdue, step in Germany's process of decolonization and confronting its past.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the British Transport Police will deploy a dedicated drone team to enhance security at London's Notting Hill Carnival, Europe's largest street party. The drones are equipped with advanced cameras, including thermal imaging and zoom capabilities, allowing officers to identify individuals from a distance and provide real-time GPS coordinates. This technological addition is part of a broader effort to manage crowd safety, which police identified as a significant risk after last year's event. The use of technology, including controversial live facial recognition, aims to keep the expected two million attendees safe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the 27th season of "South Park" has succeeded in satirizing the second Trump administration where many other comedies have failed. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have revived their anti-Trump commentary with gratifyingly mean and effective caricatures of figures like Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem. The author suggests that the show's success lies in its unapologetic and specific spite, avoiding the self-righteous tone of other topical comedies. By using its own established comedic language, the show has managed to make the outsized political landscape funny without moralizing, becoming vital television.</p>
