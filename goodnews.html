          <p>General Motors' CFO, Paul Jacobson, announced that the company anticipates its 2026 earnings will exceed its 2025 results, which have already surpassed Wall Street expectations. This positive outlook is based on several factors, including reduced electric vehicle losses, lower warranty costs, and effective management of tariffs and fixed costs. Following the announcement and an upward revision of its 2025 guidance, GM's shares surged over 10%. The company also affirmed its commitment to its share repurchase program, signaling strong confidence in its future financial performance and strategic direction. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the strong financial results, the company indicated that consumer demand for its beverages remains soft, although it is showing signs of improvement. Unit case volume saw a modest 1% increase, reversing the previous quarter's decline, but key markets like North America and Latin America remained flat. The company is now focusing on offering more affordable options, such as mini cans, to appeal to budget-conscious consumers amid persistent economic pressures.</p>

While he initially had concerns about Trump's tariff policies, he stated that he now trusts the president's judgment and execution.

          <p>The United States and Australia have announced an $8.5 billion framework deal aimed at securing the supply of critical minerals and rare earths, thereby reducing reliance on China. The agreement will mobilize financial support through loans, equity, and purchasing arrangements to bolster mining and processing projects in both nations. Analysts suggest this move is a significant step toward developing an independent supply chain, though achieving that goal could take one to two decades. The deal is expected to increase pressure on Beijing by making it harder for China to compete on mineral prices through strategic offtake agreements.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a series of reforms designed to cut bureaucratic red tape for businesses, which she claims will save firms nearly £6 billion annually. Speaking at an investment summit, Reeves stated the measures aim to "scrap needless form filling" and make the UK a more attractive destination for global investment. The proposed changes include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. While business groups welcomed the announcement, some expressed skepticism, urging the chancellor to avoid raising employer taxes in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a new coalition deal between her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. Takaichi, an ultraconservative and a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution. Her victory comes after a period of political instability, and she faces immediate pressure to address rising prices and public discontent. While her appointment is historic, Takaichi is not known as a proponent of gender equality measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising healthcare expenses and gaps in Medicare, financial experts advise seniors on how to prepare for surprise medical costs in retirement. Recommendations include thoroughly understanding what Medicare does and does not cover, particularly for dental, vision, and long-term care. Building a dedicated medical emergency fund of $5,000 to $10,000 is also suggested to act as a financial buffer. Additionally, experts stress the importance of reviewing supplemental coverage options like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans to fill coverage gaps and planning specifically for potential long-term care needs, which are often not covered by traditional Medicare.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology combining a tiny implantable chip with specialized glasses is showing significant success in restoring central vision for individuals with atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In a multi-national trial, over 80% of patients experienced notable vision improvement, with many able to read letters and words again. The system works by using a camera on the glasses to transmit visual data to the retinal chip, which then converts the images into electrical signals the brain can interpret. This breakthrough offers hope for millions affected by this leading cause of sight loss in older adults.</p>

Sandiford, 69, has been on death row for over a decade for cocaine trafficking, while Shahabadi, 35, is serving a life sentence. The Indonesian Minister for Law and Human Rights cited the poor health of both individuals as a key factor in the decision, noting Sandiford is seriously ill and Shahabadi is suffering from severe mental health disorders.

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during a U.S. government shutdown because the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles. However, other services provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) could be disrupted. If a shutdown occurs, many SSA employees would be furloughed, potentially halting services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards.

The project, led by the nonprofit Reef Doctor, sinks large limestone blocks and seeds them with life from healthy reefs.

          <p>General Motors has raised its annual profit forecast, now expecting adjusted core profit between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from a previous estimate of $10 billion to $12.5 billion. The improved outlook is partly due to a reduced financial impact from tariffs, as the company anticipates relief from a new U.S. program offering credits for domestic auto production. CEO Mary Barra thanked the Trump administration for the tariff updates, which will help make U.S.-produced vehicles more competitive. The positive forecast comes as GM also navigates a weakening market for electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
