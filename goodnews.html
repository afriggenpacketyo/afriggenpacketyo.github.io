        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study has found that bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, may not be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea. The study, which involved 270 participants traveling to regions in Asia and Africa, found no significant difference in diarrhea symptoms between those who took Pepto Bismol and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate has been approved for treating diarrhea since 1939, its off-label use for prevention may not be as beneficial as previously thought. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine if certain traveler groups or circumstances might benefit from the medication, even though the current study did not reach its target sample size.</p>

          <p>Representative Ro Khanna of California has expressed concern over President Trump's visa policies, warning they could negatively impact the U.S. economy and talent pipeline. Khanna highlighted the contributions of foreign students, including Elon Musk, to Silicon Valley's innovation and economic growth. He emphasized that international students contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, with approximately $43.8 billion in contributions during the 2023-2024 school year.

          <p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. employers increased job openings more than expected in April, totaling nearly 7.4 million, while hiring and layoffs also rose, indicating a relatively steady labor market.

Despite uncertainty in the macro outlook, the labor market appears to be returning to more normal levels, with underlying patterns in hirings and firings suggesting stability.

Unlike humans, Claude doesn't require breaks, but its performance degrades after this period due to limitations in memory and computing power. The key to AI longevity on the job is increasing the number of 'tokens,' which are words or word fragments that AI models intake through prompts. While a 24-hour AI workday may be technically feasible in the future, the environmental impact and cost associated with the required computing power raise important questions about its feasibility and desirability.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates to combat inflation, potential HELOC borrowers should carefully assess affordability, considering the variable nature of HELOC rates. Experts recommend a conservative approach, suggesting borrowers calculate payments with rates increased by 1% or 2% to account for potential fluctuations. Knowing the exact amount needed and considering the ability to pay more than the minimum interest-only payments during the draw period are also crucial.
