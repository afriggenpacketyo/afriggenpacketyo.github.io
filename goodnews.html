          <p>Data from England's 2024-25 school year reveals a strong correlation between missing school in the first week and subsequent persistent absence. Over half of pupils partially absent in the first week went on to miss at least 10% of the school year, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from the start of the new term to combat what she calls a critical issue impacting a generation's future. The government is implementing support hubs to assist struggling schools in improving attendance and behavior.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her choice to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best decision she has ever made, citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give her full commitment to the national team. Following successful knee surgery and starting counseling, she now feels "back to life" and ready for the new Women's Super League season, emphasizing the immense pressure of leadership roles.</p>

          <p>Leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, are meeting in Tianjin, China, for a summit aimed at strengthening regional ties amid tensions with the West. In his first visit to China in seven years, Modi met with President Xi Jinping, with both leaders expressing a commitment to improving relations based on mutual respect. The summit is particularly significant as both India and Russia face economic pressure from US tariffs and sanctions. The 10-member bloc is viewed by Beijing as an alternative to Western-led global structures.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee of President Trump, is stepping down from his role as the head of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure, stating his "mission accomplished." Dasgupta focused on repositioning the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool to counter Chinese influence and advance an "America First" agenda. He pushed for evaluating projects based on their return on investment for the U.S. and their role in strengthening national security, particularly concerning critical minerals. His departure comes as the administration continues to reframe America's global engagement, emphasizing strategic deals over traditional aid.</p>

The journey was undertaken to raise £1 million for The Maclean Foundation, their non-profit organization that funds clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>Researchers are testing a novel, non-lethal method to deter gray wolves from attacking livestock: drones equipped with loudspeakers. In an experiment near the California-Oregon border, biologists are blasting sounds like the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from the film "Marriage Story" to haze the predators. This creative approach comes as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West, leading to increased conflict with ranchers. While preliminary results show the drones can successfully interrupt wolf hunts, the high cost of the technology and the possibility of wolves becoming habituated to it remain significant challenges.</p>

To accomplish this, he is using only his 28 days of annual leave from his job, carefully managing costs through budget accommodations and strategic travel. Documenting his journey on social media, Burgess hopes to prove that following the sport globally can be achievable for average fans. With the expensive "flyaway" races still ahead, he acknowledges his budget will be tight but remains determined to complete his dream.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The meeting between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping is occurring under the significant economic pressure of U.S. tariffs on both nations. With the U.S. imposing a 50% tariff on key Indian exports, analysts suggest Delhi is motivated to repair its strained relationship with Beijing, which has been marked by border disputes and mutual mistrust. This potential reset could reshape global trade dynamics, as the world's second and fifth-largest economies explore closer cooperation. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit provides the platform for this dialogue, signaling a pivot toward strengthening regional alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory over Missouri State, a Football Championship Subdivision opponent. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, generating over 700 total yards and several long touchdown plays, while the defense recorded five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the lopsided score provided an opportunity to play many backups, the level of competition made it difficult to gauge the team's true strength.</p>
