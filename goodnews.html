        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it will suspend its restaurant remodeling plans, continuing its reversal of recent brand overhaul efforts. This decision follows significant customer backlash and a stock value drop of up to $200 million after the company introduced a refreshed logo, which it has since reverted. The company acknowledged that the planned modernizations did not align with what customers love about the "Old Country Store" experience. Only four of its 660 locations have been remodeled, and no further updates will proceed.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that the power for lasting change in the United States lies with its citizens, not the judiciary. During an interview promoting her new children's book, she encouraged people to become engaged and advocate for the societal changes they wish to see. Sotomayor also commented on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, explaining it bypasses the normal review process, but declined to discuss a specific pending case involving racial profiling.

          <p>Comedian Nate Bargatze, who is set to host the 77th Emmy Awards, shared insights into his preparation and comedic style for the event. He emphasized that his approach will be humorous without being mean-spirited, aiming for fun rather than roasting the attendees. Bargatze mentioned seeking advice from experienced hosts like Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, who all encouraged him to "just do you." The stand-up comedian, who was the highest-grossing in the country last year, expressed his excitement for the prestigious hosting opportunity.</p>

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer identified Home Depot as a stock with significant potential upside, particularly in anticipation of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. He pointed to recent downward revisions in U.S. job creation data as a strong indicator that multiple rate cuts could occur this year, which would benefit the home improvement retailer. Cramer also noted that falling lumber prices present another opportunity for investors considering the stock, expressing confidence that both long-term and short-term rates will decline.

          <p>Microsoft has announced a new policy requiring employees to work from an office at least three days per week, beginning in February of next year. The mandate will first apply to employees near the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters before expanding to other U.S. and international locations. In a memo, HR chief Amy Coleman stated the change is intended to foster the "energy and momentum" needed for developing AI products, not to reduce headcount. This policy updates Microsoft's previous flexible model that allowed most employees to work from home up to half the time.</p>
