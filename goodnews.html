          <h2>Dodgers' Mookie Betts Sidelined with Toe Injury After Bathroom Mishap</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts will miss games against the New York Yankees due to a fractured toe sustained while walking to the bathroom in the dark, according to reports. X-rays confirmed the fracture, and manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to be day-to-day, though putting on a shoe proved difficult. This injury follows a similar incident involving teammate Freddie Freeman, who missed games after slipping in the shower, as Freeman aggravated a surgically repaired ankle. Betts, the 2018 AL MVP, is having a relatively down year, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs, while the Dodgers beat the Yankees in a World Series rematch powered by Shohei Ohtani's two homers. The team hopes to manage this setback and continue their season successfully. Optimism is cautiously high, as the injury is not expected to be long-term.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated British rival Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match, but the match was disrupted by loud fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium, causing distractions for both players. Norrie secured a 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory over Fearnley, who appeared to sustain an injury in the second set, reaching the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time. The match was played amidst bizarre circumstances, with almost 50,000 supporters arriving at the Parc des Princes to watch PSG's Champions League final on big screens, resulting in car horns and police sirens. Despite the distractions, Norrie managed to maintain focus, while Fearnley produced a double fault on match point, as Norrie expressed his joy and acknowledged the toughness of the match against Fearnley. The environment was tense, but Norrie's victory brings a sense of accomplishment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses questions about delaying Medicare enrollment, explaining that delaying can result in penalties that increase premiums for life. However, if an individual or their spouse is still working for an employer with 20 or more employees, they can generally opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying Medicare enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account (HSA), which are no longer allowed once enrolled in Medicare. The article also clarifies the tax laws related to capital gains and home sales, distinguishing between the home sale exemption for primary residences and 1031 exchanges for investment properties.

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to warn the public to avoid the area. The incident occurred on Weidkamp Road, which was closed to allow beekeepers to assist in re-hiving the bees. Authorities initially reported that 250 million bees had escaped, but later corrected the number with the help of a beekeeper on the scene, and the public was advised to stay at least 600 feet away from the area. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue, aiming to save as many bees as possible, as hive boxes were recovered and restored, with the expectation that most bees would return to their hives by morning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism is being challenged by scientists who argue that genetics play a more significant role. Kennedy, now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find environmental culprits, despite evidence suggesting that increased autism rates are mainly due to expanding diagnostic criteria and better screening. Experts have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a case that genetics are the most important driver, rather than a single environmental toxin. Researchers fear that Kennedy's fixation on external toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

The testing mandate follows controversy surrounding Khelif after she won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, fueled by claims from the International Boxing Association that she failed eligibility tests, and athletes will now need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and eligibility to compete, starting July 1, 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the pervasive use of corporate buzzwords and their negative impact on workplace communication, as buzzwords are intended to convey pithy meaning but often impede trust and create confusion. Gen Z employees may be particularly vulnerable, clinging to jargon as corporate life rafts, and employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. The author suggests that buzzwords are used to distract from the primary goal of making money and recommends using real-human-people words instead. The piece concludes with a call to action to avoid jargon and embrace clear, authentic communication in the workplace.</p>

          <p>The biggest display of the northern lights since 2024 could unfold at the end of the weekend and start of the new week, following a massive eruption on the sun. Satellites detected an explosive solar flare, sending a cloud of charged particles toward Earth, potentially making the aurora visible as far south as Alabama to Northern California. The impending solar storm is predicted to be a level 4 out of 5, and the aurora happens when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's magnetic field, creating green, red, pink, purple, and blue colors. Clouds and smoke from Canadian wildfires may impact viewing conditions in some areas, but the farther north, the better the light show is expected to be.</p>
