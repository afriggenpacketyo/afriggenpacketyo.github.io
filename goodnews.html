          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:51:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Huawei has once again become the leading smartphone seller in China, shipping 12.2 million units in the second quarter for an 18% market share, its first time at the top since early 2024. Concurrently, Apple returned to growth in the country for the first time since late 2023, shipping 10.1 million iPhones, a 4% year-over-year increase. Apple's rebound is attributed to strategic price adjustments and enhanced trade-in offers for its iPhone 16 series amid intense competition from local brands. This performance data provides a crucial indicator of market dynamics ahead of Apple's upcoming quarterly earnings report.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Dallas Cowboys star defender Micah Parsons enters the final year of his rookie contract, negotiations for an extension have become a major focus. Cowboys executive Stephen Jones addressed the situation, stating that while the team wants to pay Parsons, the player "has to want to be paid." This comment comes after Parsons expressed frustration over the delay, noting that other top defensive players have recently secured large contracts. Despite the ongoing contract discussions, Parsons has been present at the team's training camp, though he is not fully participating due to back tightness.</p>

          <h2>WNBA Players Advocate for Higher Pay Amid League's Explosive Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:42:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the WNBA experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and revenue, its players are intensifying their push for a greater share of the league's income. The league recently secured a media-rights deal valued at nearly $3 billion, and franchise valuations are soaring, yet players currently receive less than 10% of total revenue. This disparity is a central issue in the ongoing collective-bargaining negotiations, with players arguing for a pay structure similar to other major sports leagues where athletes receive closer to 50% of revenue. The debate highlights the tension between the league's historical unprofitability and its rapidly expanding, lucrative future.</p>

          <p>Investor Mark Cuban shares a story from his early twenties when he attempted to launch a powdered milk business with less than $20, a venture that failed within a month. He learned that no matter how cost-effective he believed his product was, it was useless if there was no customer demand. This experience taught him a crucial lesson: "It doesn't matter how many times you fail. You only have to be right one time."

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful and underutilized tool for becoming more influential and likable at work. The strategy involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said to confirm understanding. This approach not only shows respect and empathy but also subtly showcases one's competence and builds trust with colleagues and superiors. Research co-authored by Wood Brooks suggests that simply asking more questions can make a person more likable, which often correlates with better job performance reviews.</p>
