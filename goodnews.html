          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has announced the suspension of "Voice of Freedom," a military-operated radio program that broadcast propaganda and outside information into North Korea. This action is the latest in a series of measures by President Lee Jae Myung's administration aimed at de-escalating military tensions with Pyongyang. The program, which included news and K-pop music, has been on and off the air since 1962, reflecting the volatile state of inter-Korean relations. Despite these gestures from Seoul, which also include dismantling propaganda loudspeakers, North Korea has so far shown little interest in improving ties.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million deal to acquire forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford, following the player's public statement urging his club to allow the move. The deal, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, comes as Newcastle seeks to bolster its attack, especially after agreeing to sell striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British record fee. Wissa, who turns 29 this week, accused Brentford of unfairly blocking his transfer despite receiving fair offers. The move marks a significant step for Newcastle in the final hours of the transfer window.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England rolls out its largest-ever expansion of government-funded childcare, some parents are making critical decisions to meet eligibility deadlines, including timing Caesarean section births. The scheme now offers 30 hours of funded childcare per week for children from nine months old, a move the government says will save families thousands. However, the rollout is facing challenges, including long waiting lists and staff shortages at nurseries, which limit the availability of places. Campaign groups also highlight that the term "free" is misleading, as many parents face extra charges for consumables, creating a "tussle between parents and providers."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following mass firings and proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration, employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize. More than 600 staffers, including rangers, biologists, and firefighters, will now be represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees. Employees cite rock-bottom morale, fear for their job security, low pay, and poor living conditions as key motivators. The unionization effort gained momentum after the park service lost about a quarter of its staff, leading to remaining workers taking on multiple jobs to keep the highly visited parks operational.</p>

          <p>This personal column explores the profound shift in daily life after the last of three children leaves for college, transforming a bustling family home into a quiet, unfamiliar space. The author describes missing not only her child but also the structure and rhythm that 27 years of active parenthood imposed on her life, from school schedules to constant interruptions. Now facing days with newfound autonomy, she feels unmoored and is creating a list of "Empty Nest resolutions" to adapt to this new phase. The piece reflects on the bittersweet transition from hands-on parenting to a quieter, more self-directed existence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new Peter Zumthor-designed building is seeing its first artwork installed ahead of its 2026 opening. The piece is a commissioned photo sculpture by L.A. artist Todd Gray, titled “Octavia Butler’s Gaze,” which now hangs on a vast concrete wall at the gallery entrance. The installation process involves new techniques, like drilling directly into the concrete and using UV direct printing to protect the art from sunlight admitted by the building's large windows. The museum is also applying unique mineral-based glazes to the gallery walls instead of paint, aiming to preserve the concrete's texture while adding color.</p>

          <p>A portion of the iconic, now-defunct Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been redeveloped into a luxury apartment complex, with residents beginning to move in this week. The 201-unit complex, named Overland & Ayres, was built on the site of a former Macy's parking structure as part of a $350 million project. This transformation reflects a broader trend of repurposing struggling indoor shopping malls for new uses like housing and offices. The remainder of the mall is being converted by UCLA into a major research center, highlighting how urban spaces are adapting to changing economic and social demands.</p>

          <p>Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor has committed nearly $1 billion in new capital to support Danish energy company Orsted, the world's largest offshore wind developer. This move serves as a vote of confidence as Orsted faces pressure from the Trump administration, which recently canceled federal funding for infrastructure supporting offshore wind projects. Equinor, Orsted's second-largest shareholder, plans to participate in a rights issue and will nominate a candidate to Orsted's board. The investment comes as Orsted's stock has plummeted following U.S. government actions, including an order to halt work on a nearly completed wind farm.</p>

Despite being strong favorites to dominate the group, the team is grappling with a significant injury crisis, with key players like Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz unavailable. This situation provides an opportunity for younger players to join the squad under coach Julian Nagelsmann, who aims to build momentum and restore the optimism seen during Euro 2024.

          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned train operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel during weekday rush hours. The move is expected to result in significant savings, such as an almost 50% reduction on the Edinburgh to Glasgow route, and aims to encourage more commuters to switch from cars to trains. A previous pilot of the scheme was ended after being deemed not financially self-sustaining, but First Minister John Swinney has reintroduced it as an investment in the rail network. The annual cost, estimated at £40-£45 million, will be covered by the ScotRail budget.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China has developed the world's first elastic, rubber-band-like material capable of efficiently converting body heat into electricity. This breakthrough in thermoelectric conversion could lead to self-charging wearable devices, such as smartwatches, eliminating the need for bulky batteries or frequent charging. The material harnesses the temperature difference between the human body (around 37°C) and the surrounding air to generate a constant power supply. Unlike previous flexible thermoelectric materials, this new creation is also highly elastic, making it ideal for integration into wearable technology and other applications.</p>

In Texas, a new statewide ban is expected to create a more equitable and engaging classroom environment. Studies and teacher surveys from pilot programs indicate that these bans lead to increased student participation and reduced anxiety, as students are less fearful of being filmed.
