          <p>Meta Platforms' shares climbed significantly after the company announced robust second-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, surpassing analyst estimates. The company also raised its third-quarter sales forecast to between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion, signaling continued growth. Increased capital expenditure estimates, primarily driven by substantial investments in artificial intelligence and hiring, reflect Meta's strategic priorities. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs unit, daily active people across Meta's family of apps grew to 3.48 billion, underscoring the strength of its core advertising business.

          <p>A Senate committee, with support from Republican Senator Josh Hawley and Democrats, voted 8-7 to advance legislation that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from buying, selling, or owning individual stocks. The bill, now called the Honest Act, requires lawmakers to sell existing stock holdings within 180 days and provide annual compliance certification. This bipartisan effort addresses concerns that current blind trusts are insufficient and aims to enhance ethical standards in public service. While former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced support, former President Trump initially expressed conceptual approval but later criticized Hawley, highlighting the complex political dynamics surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations and reinstated its full-year guidance, which now includes an estimated net $2 billion hit from tariffs. The automaker had suspended its guidance in May due to President Trump's auto tariffs, originally predicting a $2.5 billion impact, now revised to $3 billion with $1 billion offset by mitigation efforts. Despite reporting a net loss of $36 million for the quarter due to "special charges" including a large vehicle recall, Ford's "Pro" commercial business saw an 11% revenue increase, indicating resilience amid economic challenges.

          <p>The United States has successfully repatriated an American child from al-Hol Camp in northeastern Syria, a vast facility housing tens of thousands of individuals with alleged ties to ISIS. The State Department emphasized that the child "has known nothing of life outside of the camps" and will be reunited with their family. This action supports the U.S. military's long-standing advocacy for countries to repatriate their citizens from these camps, which are notorious for poor living conditions and pervasive violence. The State Department views these repatriations as the only sustainable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported robust second-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street estimates with revenue jumping 45% year-over-year to $989 million and net income more than doubling to $386 million. The platform saw significant growth, with funded customers climbing by 2.3 million to 26.5 million and total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion, driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations. Despite its exclusion from the S&P 500, Robinhood's CFO highlighted continued strong customer engagement in July. The company's expansion into crypto infrastructure and controversial synthetic stock tokens for private companies like OpenAI has garnered significant attention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study by NexusMedia, based on EasySearch data, has identified that blue cars experience the highest depreciation over time, losing an average of $12,400. Black cars follow closely with a 23.3% price decrease, while white cars depreciate the slowest, dropping only 18% in five years. The research, comparing the top 10 best-selling car models, also found that the average car depreciation across all models surged to 45.6% in 2025, up from 38.8% in 2023, with electric vehicles losing nearly 60% of their value. This highlights how aesthetic choices, like color, increasingly influence a vehicle's long-term financial retention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to ban the use of the N-word and the C-word, or any variations, during public meetings, effective immediately. This decision aims to address years of speakers using racial slurs and other offensive language, which Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson stated has discouraged public participation. Speakers violating the new rule will receive a warning and face removal from the room, with potential bans from future meetings. However, the ban faces anticipated legal challenges from individuals who argue it infringes on First Amendment free speech rights, setting up a potential court battle.</p>

          <p>A divided Federal Reserve voted 9-2 to keep its benchmark interest rate steady between 4.25%-4.5%, defying calls from President Donald Trump for aggressive cuts. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller dissented, arguing for easing rates due to controlled inflation and potential labor market weakening, marking a rare occurrence of multiple governors opposing the majority. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that future decisions, including any potential September cut, will depend on upcoming economic data, particularly inflation and labor market reports, while also signaling concern about the potential impact of tariffs.

          <p>The Hollywood Premiere Motel, despite its low guest ratings, has achieved significant recognition by becoming the first motel designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. The City Council approved the designation, celebrating the 1960 motel's distinctive mid-century Googie design and weathered neon sign as prime examples of roadside architecture from a bygone era. The two-story, 42-unit building is lauded as a "highly intact and rare example" of a 1960s motel that accommodated automobile tourism in Hollywood. This designation acknowledges its architectural significance and ensures city review for any future alterations or demolition, preserving a piece of local history.</p>

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 4.2 basis points to 4.37%, while the 2-year yield was up 6.6 basis points. These movements reflect market reactions to the Fed's cautious monetary policy stance and ongoing economic data, as policymakers continue to assess inflation and labor market conditions.
