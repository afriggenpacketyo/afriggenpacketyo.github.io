          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore has affirmed the company's commitment to its expansion plans despite receiving a shorter-than-usual two-year casino license renewal from regulators. The Gambling Regulatory Authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance, but the resort is proceeding with a SG$6.8 billion investment. New attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium have already opened, with a focus on shifting from shopping to premium lifestyle experiences to revitalize its appeal. The company aims to be ready for its next license review in 2026.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant tariff hike. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices." Despite the truce, some business owners express concern over continued uncertainty, and trade flows between the two economic giants have already seen a significant decline this year.

After Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body, he took her to the remote grave site. Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can to mark the location and later informed the police, leading to the recovery of Parsons' remains.

          <p>FC Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he agreed to join Manchester United in 2012 and was eager to play for then-manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The move from Borussia Dortmund ultimately fell through because the German club refused to sell him, believing they could earn more by keeping him for another couple of years. While Lewandowski expressed that not playing in the Premier League might be a regret, he remains happy with his accomplished career at top European clubs. The Polish international also discussed his longevity in the sport and the influence of his former Dortmund manager, Jürgen Klopp.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone firm, Wild Hornets, has released video showing its "Sting" interceptor drone reaching speeds of up to 195 miles per hour (315 km/h). This velocity is crucial for its role in chasing down and destroying Russian-launched Shahed loitering munitions, which are a constant threat to Ukrainian infrastructure. The low-cost, $2,500 first-person-view (FPV) drone is part of a broader Ukrainian effort to innovate and scale up drone production for air defense. This is part of a technological arms race, as Russia is reportedly developing faster, jet-powered drones.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub, is leaving the company to "become a founder again," with his departure set for the end of the year. Dohmke has led the popular code-hosting platform since 2021, overseeing the launch and growth of its AI-powered Copilot tool. His exit comes as GitHub faces increasing competition from a wave of new AI coding startups like Cursor and Replit, which are gaining traction among developers. GitHub will continue to operate within Microsoft's CoreAI division, but a direct successor for Dohmke has not yet been named.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for a shift in the country's fiercely competitive "quick commerce" sector. He urged the government to guide the industry away from excessive cash-burning price wars and towards higher-level competition based on innovation and quality. Wang noted that the rapid delivery market creates valuable new consumption opportunities that are vital for China's long-term growth. The goal, he stated, should not be to stifle competition but to foster a win-win approach through an improved industrial ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nepal Waives Climbing Fees for 97 Mountains to Boost Remote Tourism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 21:55:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its more remote regions, Nepal has announced that it will waive climbing fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. The mountains are located in the country's less-developed Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent fee increase for summiting Mount Everest, which will now cost $15,000 during peak season. Officials hope that making these less-explored peaks free to climb will attract more mountaineers, create jobs, and stimulate the local economies in these poorer areas of the country.</p>
