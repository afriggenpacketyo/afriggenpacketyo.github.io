          <p>An associate director at Vox, born and raised in Los Angeles, offers a counter-narrative to the media's portrayal of the city as a war zone overrun by immigrants. She emphasizes the vital contributions of immigrants, particularly Latinos, to the city's identity, culture, and economy, highlighting their resilience and camaraderie. The author contrasts this with President Trump's depiction of Los Angeles as a lawless place requiring federal intervention, arguing that the media often overlooks the positive aspects of immigrant communities and their struggles. The piece underscores the importance of acknowledging the humanity and sacrifices of immigrants who have quietly built Los Angeles.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 12:04:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold became the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal. Central banks amass liquid assets like gold as a hedge against inflation and to diversify their holdings, and the metal is now second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. China, India, and Turkey have been major buyers, and geopolitical and economic uncertainty have spurred a flight to safe-haven assets, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Analysts suggest that central bank purchases may cool in the coming months, but many tailwinds that have propelled gold still remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the government's Spending Review, outlining day-to-day budgets for departments over the next three years, impacting public services such as the NHS, schools, transport, housing, prisons, and policing.

The NHS will receive a 3% annual real-terms increase in spending, while transport infrastructure will see long-term investment, including a new Liverpool to Manchester rail line and a freeze on bus fares. A substantial ¬£39 billion was allocated for social and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old man from New Jersey sustained minor injuries after being gored by a bison in the Upper Geyser Basin region of Yellowstone National Park. This incident marks the second such clash in a month, highlighting the dangers of approaching bison despite warnings from park officials. Yellowstone visitors are required to stay more than 25 yards away from large animals like bison and elk, and at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and cougars. Park officials emphasize that bison can be aggressive and unpredictable if people do not respect their space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. increased slightly in May to 2.4%, driven by a rise in grocery prices, which was partially offset by lower gasoline prices. Economists anticipate that President Trump's tariff policy will likely increase consumer prices in the coming months, although the impact remains muted for now. The consumer price index rose 0.1% from April to May, and the monthly rate is consistent with bringing inflation down to the Federal Reserve's long-term target. The healing of supply chains and a weakening labor market are also contributing to the moderation of inflation.</p>
