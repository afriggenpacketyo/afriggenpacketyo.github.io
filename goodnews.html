        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity among employees, especially Gen Zers who are used to instant answers. Studies show that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, often as a way to cope with feeling insecure. The article suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, with the author advocating for the use of plain language instead. By using real-human-people words, the author argues, communication can be more effective and genuine.</p>

Nvidia's better-than-expected quarter and upbeat guidance drove its stock price up, while Salesforce saw a decline despite positive results. Inflation data, particularly the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, came in cooler than expected, contributing to the argument that price pressures are easing (not investment advice).</p>
