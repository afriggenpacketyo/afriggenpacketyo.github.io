          <p>NatWest has issued an apology after its mobile banking application experienced an outage, preventing numerous customers in the UK from accessing their accounts. The issue, which began earlier in the day, prompted many users to report problems on Downdetector, and while card payments remain unaffected, customers have expressed frustration over being unable to transfer money or conduct online shopping. NatWest has advised affected users to utilize online banking services as an alternative, though some customers have reported issues with that as well, and the bank is currently working to resolve the problem but has not provided a specific timeframe for a fix.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is increasingly testing the resilience of roads, rails, and bridges worldwide, necessitating adaptations to prevent infrastructure failures. Roads are susceptible to melting and deformation, railways can buckle, and bridges face thermal expansion issues, and solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, using tree-based resins instead of petroleum-based asphalt, and painting rails white to reduce heat absorption. Bridges are being redesigned with bearings to absorb larger movements and undergo more frequent inspections, and these adaptations are vital to ensure the continued operation and safety of transport networks in a warming climate.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares saw a rise in premarket trading following a significant drop triggered by recent tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The stock had experienced a $152 billion decrease a day earlier, and analysts are attributing the premarket recovery to reports that Trump has scheduled a call with Musk to negotiate a truce. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggests that a reconciliation between Musk and Trump would be beneficial for Tesla shares, which he believes were oversold due to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate confiscated cryptocurrencies from criminal cases through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, potentially aiding the city's virtual asset hub ambitions. The municipal Public Security Bureau has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to sell seized cryptoassets through regulated platforms in Hong Kong, and the proceeds will be converted into yuan and deposited in designated accounts. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets by leveraging Hong Kong's virtual asset regime, and China enforces a strict ban on crypto trading, complicating asset handling.</p>

          <p>Russia's central bank has reduced its interest rates for the first time since September 2022, decreasing them by 100 basis points to 20%, signaling that inflation pressures are starting to ease. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter, and the central bank stated that the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, but monetary policy will remain tight to reach its 4% inflation target. Despite ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions, the ruble has been the world's best-performing currency this year, attributed to capital controls and policy tightening.</p>

          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern half of the United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped over 300 acres of parallel rows of earthen mounds, remnants of raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of agriculture in this northern location is surprising, considering the challenging growing conditions and the availability of wild rice nearby, and the discovery underscores the extent and sophistication of Indigenous farming practices before European colonization.</p>

          <p>Recreational salmon fishing in California is resuming for a limited time after a two-year shutdown aimed at helping the population recover, and while commercial fishing remains canceled, fishery regulators have approved a limited recreational season with strict quotas. The opening weekend is expected to be crowded, and each angler will be allowed to catch up to two fish per day. Biologists attribute salmon population declines to various factors, including dams, habitat loss, and climate change, and there are hopes that salmon populations will improve next year due to the boost they received during 2023's wet winter.</p>

Nourishing the gut-brain axis and avoiding both too little and too much sleep are also key to healthy aging.</p>
