          <p>Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia are participating in local elections, which are seen as an early indicator of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government's performance since taking office in May. The Christian Democrats (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD), the coalition partners, hope the weather won't impact voter turnout. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) aims to strengthen its position in the region following recent gains in polls, despite being classified as "right-wing extremist" by the domestic intelligence agency. This election's outcome will be closely monitored to assess the political climate in Germany and the strength of various parties.</p>

          <p>USC overcame a weather delay and past road struggles to defeat Purdue 33-17 in their first Big Ten road game, marking their first win outside the West since 2012. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the Trojans' offense with 282 passing yards and a rushing touchdown, supported by Waymond Jordan and Eli Sanders, who combined for 152 rushing yards. Despite a missed field goal and Purdue's attempts to rally, a late interception by safety Bishop Fitzgerald sealed the victory for USC. The Trojans had lost 14 straight games in the Eastern and Central time zones prior to this win, making it a significant milestone for the team.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill to phase out PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from cookware and other household items, after a debate that included celebrity chefs and environmentalists. Senate Bill 682 prohibits PFAS in cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging, and certain children's products, with compliance deadlines ranging from 2028 to 2031. The legislation cites health risks as the reason for the ban, as exposure to PFAS has been linked to various negative health effects. The bill now goes to Gov. Gavin Newsom for his signature.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has created a new generation of foundation models that match the performance of larger models while being smaller and more cost-efficient, thanks to a technical innovation. The Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B model performs ten times faster in some tasks than its predecessor, the Qwen3-32B, and achieves a 90% reduction in training costs. Emad Mostaque, co-founder of Stability AI, noted that Alibaba’s new model outperforms many models from the previous year despite costing less than $500,000 to train. In comparison, Google's Gemini Ultra cost an estimated $191 million to train.</p>

          <p>A mother, Julie, shares her experience of pushing her autistic daughter, Rosie, to attend school until she "broke," leading to a diagnosis of emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA). Rosie experienced severe anxiety, self-harm, and night terrors due to the school environment, prompting Julie to eventually remove her from school. School leaders report an increase in EBSA among pupils, particularly during the transition to secondary school, citing factors like sensory overload and social media pressures. Schools are implementing strategies to support children with EBSA, emphasizing inclusion and providing specialized units.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers passed a bill to allow the construction of 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley, while also tightening regulations on offshore drilling. Senate Bill 237 aims to stabilize crude-oil refineries and address concerns about gas prices. The bill grants statutory approval for new wells in Kern County, circumventing legal challenges by environmental groups. The measure also allows the governor to suspend the state’s summer-blend gasoline fuel standards if prices spike. Lawmakers also extended the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled for a second state visit to the UK, seen by some as a chance to strengthen bilateral relations, while others view it as a vanity trip. The visit includes a stay at Windsor Castle, a carriage ride with the King and Queen, and military pageantry. Some diplomatic insiders say it's essential to keep Trump onside, as he can easily change his mind. Despite potential controversies, the visit is viewed as a powerful diplomatic tool for the UK to maintain close ties with the US.</p>

          <p>Brentford is using long throws as an effective tactical weapon in the Premier League, reminiscent of Rory Delap's impact at Stoke City. Fabio Carvalho scored a late goal for Brentford against Chelsea following a long throw from Kevin Schade. Brentford has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, more than any other Premier League team. Brentford's coach, Keith Andrews, suggests there is snobbery around this tactic, but the team continues to utilize it to create scoring opportunities.</p>
