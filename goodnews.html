          <p>Clark Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, has publicly credited Taylor Swift's relationship with tight end Travis Kelce for a significant transformation in the team's fanbase. He noted that the team has seen an unprecedented increase in female fans, with the demographic shifting from a 50-50 male-female split to 57% female. Hunt praised the pop star's unintentional but powerful impact, referring to it as the "Taylor Swift effect" that has brought a new level of attention and engagement to the team. The owner also expressed his personal happiness for the couple, highlighting their positive influence on the Chiefs' community.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the UK have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he placed on an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. Devon and Cornwall Police successfully argued in court that the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, obtaining a forfeiture order under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This action follows a previous seizure of £2.7 million from Tate and his brother for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. Police stated the seized funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives within the community.</p>

          <p>A California-based program called Dec My Dorm is providing essential supplies to students transitioning from the foster care system into college life, addressing a critical gap in support. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware that dorm rooms are typically unfurnished beyond a bed and desk. The non-profit kits them out with everything from bedding and towels to toolboxes and school supplies, helping to level the playing field and reduce the sense of isolation. By involving the students in choosing their own items, the program aims to give them a sense of ownership and belonging in their new environment.</p>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to manage anxiety and set a positive tone for the day. Her primary rule is to wake up early when her alarm goes off, no matter what, to create personal time before work and family obligations begin. Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this time flexibly for activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, which helps foster creativity and rejuvenation. She also advocates for getting fully dressed for work, even when remote, to maintain a motivated and professional mindset throughout the day.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom residence located in Windsor Great Park. This move places them in a larger home but keeps them near their children's school and their current, smaller property, Adelaide Cottage. The relocation comes after the royal family announced cost-saving measures, though the Prince benefits from the billion-pound Duchy of Cornwall estate. The new home, nestled within a 4,800-acre park, aligns with the Princess's advocacy for the healing power of nature, a theme she has emphasized during her recent cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>To prevent its sale to developers, a Pennsylvania couple took out a $1 million loan to purchase Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre, the oldest operating drive-in in the world. Opened in 1934, the historic venue was at risk of closure before Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney stepped in, using their life savings for the down payment. After a challenging first year, the theater became profitable, bringing in nearly $550,000 in revenue in 2024 by operating year-round and hosting community events like craft fairs and car shows. Their efforts have preserved a piece of film history and revitalized a beloved local hub.</p>

          <h2>Samsung Gains U.S. Market Share on Apple as Foldable Phones Prove Popular</h2>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard smartphone design. While Apple still leads with 49% of the market, its share has declined, signaling renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may respond with its own foldable iPhone in the coming years to counter Samsung's momentum and appeal to consumers seeking new designs.</p>

          <p>A fugitive crime boss, Jamie Rothwell, was located and arrested after he inadvertently revealed his location by taking a selfie in his Barcelona apartment and sharing it on EncroChat. International law enforcement had successfully hacked the encrypted communication network, which was widely used by criminals for coordinating illicit activities. The messages exposed Rothwell's command of a multi-million-pound drug and weapons trafficking operation, including AK-47s, and his role in a gangland shooting. The critical mistake of sharing personal photos on the compromised platform led directly to his capture and subsequent 43-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy offers three actionable steps to develop emotional endurance, which is the capacity to handle stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. She advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that frustration is a natural part of the learning process, not a sign of failure. Kennedy also stresses the power of engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult situations and build mental strength. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body and mind to better tolerate discomfort.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. Trump stated the goal is to go directly to a comprehensive peace agreement to end the war, rather than a temporary ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and European leaders, who reportedly welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal. Trump suggested that if the talks with Zelenskyy are successful, a subsequent meeting with Putin could be scheduled to finalize an agreement.</p>

          <p>According to a new Gallup survey, the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the poll began in 1939. The data also reveals that those who do drink are consuming less, driven by growing concerns about the health impacts of alcohol. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with teen drinking rates having fallen dramatically over the past two decades. This societal shift away from alcohol is viewed as a significant public health positive, potentially leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social problems across the country.</p>

The discovery is expected to finally bring closure to a family that has been without answers for decades.</p>

          <p>Friends and former colleagues are remembering Ted Clark, a veteran NPR correspondent and editor who passed away at the age of 79. Clark, who grew up as the child of a U.S. diplomat, was praised for his gentle demeanor, fairness, and masterful editing during his time covering the White House and State Department. Colleagues recalled him as a patient mentor who nurtured reporters and staunchly defended them. An anecdote from a 1990 trip to Mozambique highlighted his deep compassion, particularly for children affected by war, reflecting a career defined by both exceptional journalism and profound humanity.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first archaeological excavation in Northumberland, England. The decorative artifact, believed to have been used by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes, was found near the route of a major Roman road. The find is particularly significant as it is similar to another high-status object discovered nearby in 2021, suggesting the area was an important thoroughfare for influential people long after the Roman era. The piece will undergo further analysis before potentially being displayed in a local museum.</p>
