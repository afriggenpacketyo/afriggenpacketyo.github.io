          <p>One of the two eaglets, Sunny, born to famed bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow in Big Bear, California, has taken its first flight from the nest. The eaglet, approximately 12 weeks old, jumped from a branch and successfully flew away, while her sister Gizmo remained behind. Sunny's flight followed days of practice flapping and jumping on the nest's outer rails. Gizmo and Sunny are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, with their long-term whereabouts unknown as they are not banded.</p>

          <h2>Consider Opening a Long-Term CD This June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 14:47:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article suggests that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June could be a wise financial move due to potential interest rate cuts, protection against market volatility, and the opportunity to earn substantial interest. With Federal Reserve rate cuts potentially imminent, locking in current rates can be advantageous. A long-term CD provides a fixed interest rate, shielding savings from market fluctuations and ensuring predictable returns. The article offers insight into the possible benefits of securing a CD in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>
