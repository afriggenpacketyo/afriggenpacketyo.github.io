          <p>Helen Hunt has discussed her decision to reject Hollywood's beauty standards after years of feeling "misery and shame" about her physical appearance. Hunt, now 61, shared that she internalized the pressure to look a certain way early in her career but eventually decided to prioritize her mental well-being. She mentioned being influenced by "The Only Diet There Is," a book promoting intuitive eating and self-acceptance. Hunt joins other '90s stars like Christina Applegate, who have spoken about the struggles with body image and eating disorders stemming from the pressures of fame. Hunt's experience demonstrates the importance of self-acceptance in an industry often driven by unrealistic beauty standards.</p>

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia early Sunday, with the epicenter located 17 kilometers northeast of Paratebueno. The U.S. Geological Service reported the quake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers, and the Colombian Geological Service recorded additional tremors ranging from 4 to 4.6 in magnitude shortly after. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management is assessing the situation in several municipalities. While images on social media showed people in Bogota evacuating workplaces, initial reports indicate no casualties or significant damage. Colombia's location in the Pacific Ring of Fire makes it prone to frequent seismic activity.</p>
