          <p>Netflix is fully committed to leveraging generative artificial intelligence across its streaming platform, aiming to improve title recommendations, advertising, and content creation. The company's earnings report highlighted AI's potential to empower creators with tools for tasks like de-aging characters and exploring set designs, as seen in recent productions. This strategy unfolds amidst broader industry concerns about AI's potential to displace human workers and its use of human-made content. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos, however, maintains that AI will enhance creativity rather than replace it, asserting confidence in its role in storytelling.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, ending a four-month decline, largely driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to fall by 13.3%, primarily due to a significant drop in auto shipments. Despite a trade deal in July that reduced U.S. tariffs, the impact of policy factors like tariffs appears to outweigh currency fluctuations on export performance. The data comes as Japan welcomes its first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, whose policies could further influence the trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has banned gambling advertisements from Kwiff and Betway featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. Investigations followed complaints that these ads would appeal strongly to individuals under 18. The ASA cited Hamilton's significant public profile, large youth following on social media, and appearances in child-rated media as reasons for the ban. Both companies were warned against including characters with strong appeal to minors, with Kwiff having since removed content displaying mainstream sports figures.</p>

          <p>Celebrated author Sir Philip Pullman has called upon the UK government to revise copyright laws concerning "scraping," where artificial intelligence software uses writers' books to train language models without compensation or recognition. Pullman, along with other authors, criticizes this practice as "theft" that could undermine creative industries. He insists that writers should be paid for the use of their work, describing the current system as "wicked." The government has initiated a consultation and established expert working groups on AI and copyright, but Pullman demands immediate legislative changes to protect creators' rights.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are anticipated to arrive in New Orleans by late November to assist the city's understaffed police department, as confirmed by Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick. The deployment, requested by Governor Jeff Landry, aims to serve as a "force multiplier" during major upcoming events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. While acknowledging the need for support, Kirkpatrick emphasized that the Guard's role is a partnership, not an takeover, and stated her opposition to their deployment for routine law enforcement outside of major events. The police department currently requires approximately 300 more officers.</p>

          <h2>New Law Aims to Combat Surging Copper Wire Theft Plaguing Los Angeles Communities</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles communities are grappling with a surge in copper wire theft, leaving thousands of streetlights dark and costing millions in repairs, as exemplified by the unlit Sixth Street Bridge. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal. The bill will require junk dealers to verify sellers' identities and lawful ownership, make possession of certain public scrap metal illegal, and increase penalties for non-compliant recyclers. City officials hope this legislation, alongside the adoption of solar lighting, will help curb the crime that impacts public safety.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner expressed optimism regarding the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire, despite recent violence and challenges in recovering all deceased hostages. They acknowledged the inherent difficulties in transitioning from intense warfare to peace, urging patience as efforts continue to secure the remaining bodies. The agreement has seen prisoner exchanges and the release of living Israeli hostages, with Vance emphasizing that no American troops will be deployed in Gaza. However, skepticism persists among some Israeli officials about Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to a lasting peace, and the demilitarization of Gaza remains a significant hurdle.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills "quicker and easier," introducing automatic penalties of up to £20,000 for minor offenses. For more serious breaches, the Environment Agency (EA) will be empowered to impose fines up to £500,000 with a reduced burden of proof. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the aim is to give the EA the "teeth it needs" to tackle rule-breaking, expecting the new system to generate £50m-£67m annually, with costs borne by shareholders. This initiative addresses widespread public concern over frequent sewage discharges and the EA's previous struggles to enforce regulations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two trichologists, Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker, have debunked four common haircare myths, aiming to guide consumers toward healthier hair practices. They clarify that cold water does not make hair shinier, and no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which require a haircut. Furthermore, the idea of hair "self-cleaning" is false, as regular washing is essential to remove oil and debris that can worsen scalp conditions. They also advise against excessive use of dry shampoo, recommending it only once between washes to prevent scalp issues. The experts stress focusing on scalp care similar to facial skincare.</p>

Revenue increased 53% year-over-year to $15.36 billion, surpassing estimates, with adjusted earnings per share up 32%. The strong credit metrics, including lower net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, eased market concerns about its exposure to the subprime market.

          <p>For the first time, academics have ranked the physical side effects of different antidepressants, revealing significant variations that could impact patient health and adherence to treatment. The study, involving 30 commonly used drugs, showed differences in weight gain (up to 2kg), heart rate changes (up to 21 bpm), and blood pressure. Researchers from King's College London and the University of Oxford emphasize that this data should not prompt patients to stop medication but rather encourage closer matching of antidepressants to individual needs and existing health conditions.
