          <p>A tsunami warning for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been lifted following a series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest of which registered a 7.4 magnitude. The quakes struck in the sea east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, prompting initial alerts from Russian authorities and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. A tsunami watch for Hawaii was also issued and later canceled. Fortunately, there have been no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic events.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Nathalia Holt's new book, "The Beast in the Clouds," details an expedition by Theodore Roosevelt's sons, Ted and Kermit, to China in 1928. The brothers embarked on a perilous journey into unexplored territories with the secret goal of finding a giant panda, a creature so rare it was considered mythical by many. At the time, the panda was the only large mammal that had not been acquired for museum collections. The book explores the sense of adventure and discovery that characterized the era.</p>

          <p>Amid conservative criticism of the new Superman film's director labeling the character an immigrant, author Grant Morrison highlights the superhero's leftist roots. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was portrayed as a socialist-leaning "Champion of the Oppressed," fighting corrupt bosses and tearing down slums. The article traces the character's evolution through different eras, from a patriotic figure during WWII to a family man in the 1950s, arguing his enduring appeal lies in his ability to reflect contemporary societal values.</p>

          <p>Chinese analysts suggest that China could effectively counter U.S. technology restrictions by fostering artificial intelligence innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South. According to a researcher at the Institute of Public Policy, this strategy would involve partnering on inclusive AI infrastructure, technology sharing, and developing ethical frameworks suited to diverse regional needs. Such collaboration is seen as a way for China to move beyond its direct rivalry with the U.S. and build a more equitable global tech ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread talk of Australia's "desperation" to keep the series alive, analysts are skeptical it will be enough to defeat the British and Irish Lions in their upcoming match. While the Wallabies showed some fight in their first Test loss, the Lions demonstrated superior physicality and creativity for most of the game. The article argues that the Lions' high error count in the latter part of the first match is unlikely to be repeated, and their overall quality should secure another victory against an undercooked Australian side.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have directly observed the earliest stages of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers detected silicate minerals condensing in the gas disk surrounding the star, which is only 100,000 to 200,000 years old. This groundbreaking discovery provides an unprecedented glimpse into the processes that likely formed Earth and other rocky planets in our own solar system. It suggests that the initial steps of planet formation may be a common cosmic process.</p>
