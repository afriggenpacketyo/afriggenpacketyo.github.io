          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning to visit the United States for a fifth round of ministerial-level talks, aiming to find common ground before a summit between the two countries' leaders. This comes as Japan's capital spending rose 6.4% in January-March, marking the first increase in two quarters, driven by investments in production capacity and digitalization. Other news includes former yokozuna Hakuho's expected retirement announcement, defense tech subsidies for Japanese universities totaling 2.7 billion yen, and a Japanese whaling ship returning after taking 25 fin whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. North Korea also lifted a ban on military use of space for defense purposes.</p>

The study reveals unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia‚Äôs far east. This research aims to provide a more inclusive understanding of human genetic diversity, addressing the historical underrepresentation of Southeast Asian populations in genomic databases.</p>

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economic outlook, the aviation industry is projected to improve its profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association. Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are expected to increase, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Net profits are projected at $36 billion, up from $32.4 billion in 2024, with total revenues hitting a record high of $979 billion. Passenger load factors are also expected to reach an all-time high, indicating strong demand for air travel despite broader economic challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to strike deep inside Russian territory, hitting multiple airfields with a clandestine drone operation, destroying or damaging Soviet-era nuclear-capable heavy bombers. The operation, carried out without informing the US, involved smuggling 150 FPV drones in shipping containers. This move comes as peace negotiations begin in Istanbul and amid concerns about future security assistance from the US, signaling Ukraine's determination to impose its own penalties on Russia. The success of the operation is expected to boost morale and encourage pro-Ukrainian Republicans who are growing impatient with Trump's policies.</p>
