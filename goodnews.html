        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, marking the largest one-day drop in over a year. This decline was a direct reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which eased concerns about inflation and future Federal Reserve rate hikes. For potential homebuyers, this rate drop could translate into considerable monthly savings, although it remains uncertain if this will be enough to reinvigorate a housing market hampered by high prices. Analysts suggest that rates may need to fall into the 5% range to significantly boost buyer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the abrupt resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to assert his authority and refocus his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer has recast his top team, appointing new home and foreign secretaries in a move designed to re-energize his administration. This political maneuver is seen as an attempt to seize control of the narrative after a difficult start to the week and to prepare for upcoming political battles. The scale of the changes represents both an opportunity and a risk for the prime minister's leadership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially withdrawn a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, was never enacted and faced strong opposition from airline industry groups who argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider such requirements that go beyond what Congress has statutorily mandated. This decision is part of a broader review of aviation consumer protection rules, including those related to ancillary fee disclosures.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy as not just a designer but a revolutionary business leader who built a global empire. Armani masterfully maintained creative control over his brand by never merging or selling his company, ensuring a consistent vision of sophisticated, accessible luxury. He famously pioneered the deconstructed power suit for men and women, tapping into the cultural zeitgeist of the 1970s and 80s. His strategic use of Hollywood, dressing stars for films and red carpet events, was a novel approach that cemented his brand's iconic status and commercial success.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online shopping or browsing is not a sackable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after spy software tracked her personal computer use. The ruling noted that the employee's personal browsing was not excessive, and the company had no clear policy against it. The judge concluded that the true reason for the dismissal was the business owner's desire to remove the employee before she could legally claim unfair dismissal.</p>

          <p>The reunion of the iconic British rock band Oasis is creating a wave of excitement in Los Angeles, culminating in a major show at the Rose Bowl. For years, dedicated tribute bands were the only way for fans to experience the group's music live, but the Gallagher brothers' reconciliation has sparked a level of enthusiasm compared to Beatlemania. Local bars, clubs, and even a photography gallery are hosting Oasis-themed events to celebrate the tour. For many fans, the concerts offer a rare moment of communal joy and a welcome distraction from a difficult year of political tension and local crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) must decide on their next financial move. Simply allowing a CD to roll over could lock in a much lower rate than previously enjoyed. This article explores three viable options: moving funds to a high-yield savings account for flexibility, opting for a money market account that combines high rates with checking features, or reinvesting in a new long-term CD to secure a fixed rate against future market declines. Each strategy offers different benefits depending on the saver's goals for liquidity and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock surged nearly 11% after the company reported strong earnings and announced it has secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips, believed to be OpenAI. CEO Hock Tan revealed over $10 billion in new orders, leading to a significantly improved revenue outlook for fiscal year 2026. This surprise announcement means that previous earnings estimates were too low, making the stock appear cheaper on a price-to-earnings basis even after its significant price jump. Tan also extended his contract as CEO through 2030, further boosting investor confidence in the company's long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris topped the timesheets during Friday practice for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. The session saw tight competition, with Norris noting the field was "a bit close for my liking" as he aims to close the championship gap to his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Several drivers, including Norris and Piastri, tested the limits of the high-speed circuit, resulting in a few off-track moments. The results suggest a close qualifying and race ahead, with McLaren, Ferrari, and Williams all showing competitive pace at the low-downforce track.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has paused a mandate requiring 20% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2026 and is implementing a new "Buy Canadian" policy for federal contracts. These measures are a response to economic headwinds, including recent job losses and the impact of U.S. trade tariffs. While the short-term EV target is paused for review, the long-term goals of 60% electric sales by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain in place. The new procurement rules are designed to support domestic industries, particularly the auto, steel, and aluminum sectors, which have been hit hard by U.S. trade policies.</p>
