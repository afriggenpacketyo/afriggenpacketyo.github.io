        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO defense ministers showed broad support for a historic hike in defense spending, responding to the growing threat from Russia. Secretary General Mark Rutte proposed an overall investment plan totaling 5% of gross domestic product in defense investment. The proposal splits the spending goal, allotting 3.5% of national GDP to "core defense spending" and 1.5% to "defense- and security-related investment". The increased spending could strain public finances, particularly in major European economies facing economic challenges.</p>
