          <p>During a WNBA playoff game between the Indiana Fever and the Atlanta Dream, Fever player Sophie Cunningham was seen in a verbal exchange with a police officer at center court. The incident occurred during an injury timeout in the fourth quarter, with Cunningham and teammate Caitlin Clark approaching the officer before being motioned back. Cunningham later shared a photo of the encounter on social media, captioning it with "THIS IS SOME AURA," as her team went on to win the game and the series.</p>

However, statements from Chinese state media and ByteDance suggest that negotiations are ongoing and key details, particularly regarding the algorithm's ownership, remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies are strategically shifting their focus towards Southeast Asia, using a major trade fair in Nanning as a platform to cultivate new business relationships in the region. Facing saturated markets and slowing economic growth in Europe and the United States, these firms see significant potential in Southeast Asia's rapidly expanding economies and large, youthful consumer base. This pivot reflects a broader trend of reorienting global trade flows as businesses adapt to changing economic and geopolitical landscapes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing its improper form and use of political rhetoric. The judge ruled that the 85-page complaint was excessively long and functioned more as a "podium for a passionate oration" than a proper legal document. While the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint.</p>
