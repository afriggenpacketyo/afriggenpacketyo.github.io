          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Currently, the storm is tracking northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. The storm's projected path could bring it east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify over open waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers practical advice for consumers considering buying refurbished technology, emphasizing that 'refurbished' does not uniformly mean 'like-new.' It advises buyers to scrutinize the seller's reputation, warranty and return policies, and what accessories are included, as these can vary widely. Key points include verifying battery health, ensuring the device still receives software updates for security, and thoroughly testing the product upon arrival. Following these steps can help consumers find genuine value while avoiding common pitfalls associated with secondhand electronics.</p>

The homeowner emphasizes the need for diligent planning and adapting to a changing climate, hoping his experience encourages more sustainable construction and energy independence for others.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like hairy caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are a significant part of the local diet, valued as a high-protein, organic food source. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects are harvested from forests or farmed commercially to supplement diets in a country where traditional meat is prohibitively expensive for many. The practice has reportedly grown in recent decades due to economic hardship and environmental changes, offering a sustainable and traditional nutritional alternative.</p>

          <p>Prominent television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to producing his shows in California, a decision bolstered by the community's response to recent wildfires and an improved state tax credit program. Despite industry trends of relocating productions to cheaper locations, Kelley's company is keeping all current projects, including the third season of "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," based in the Los Angeles area. The move is seen as a vote of confidence in the local industry and an effort to support Hollywood's workforce and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including Great Britain's 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, have raised concerns about the inconvenient location of the main warm-up facility. The venue is a 15-minute bus ride from the main stadium, forcing competitors into a lengthy and potentially draining pre-event routine. World Athletics President Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is "not perfect," explaining that logistical challenges arose after the track used for the Olympics became unavailable, but stated that organizers have done their best to manage the issue.</p>

          <p>The intense, all-consuming infatuation known as "limerence" is explored in a new book by neuroscientist Tom Bellamy, who describes it as a state of romantic obsession that can create an extraordinary natural high. However, this feeling can devolve into anxiety and craving if the feelings are not reciprocated or a stable bond cannot be formed, particularly with an unsuitable or unavailable person. The book offers practical, science-based strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact and reframing daydreams to regain emotional control.</p>

          <p>MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor claims that as large institutions increasingly invest in Bitcoin through vehicles like ETFs, the cryptocurrency's notorious price volatility is likely to decrease. While this growing stability makes it a more attractive and comfortable asset for mega-institutions, he acknowledges it also makes it less exciting for retail traders who thrive on dramatic price swings. Despite a recent cool-off from its all-time high, significant inflows into ETFs are creating a supply squeeze and indicating a maturing market. (not investment advice)</p>
