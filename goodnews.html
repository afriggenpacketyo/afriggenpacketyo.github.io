          <p>House Republicans are advocating for spending cancellations through a rescissions bill, aiming to claw back previously allocated funds. This push comes as conservatives and Elon Musk express dissatisfaction with the limited spending cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. Musk criticized the legislation for increasing the budget deficit and undermining the work of the DOGE team, while the House Freedom Caucus supports the rescissions. The plan targets $9.4 billion in cuts from public broadcasting and foreign aid programs, requiring a simple majority in both the House and Senate for approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece challenges the narrative that China has stolen millions of American jobs, arguing that the so-called 'China shock' was actually beneficial for America. While acknowledging that some sectors experienced layoffs and regional manufacturing declined, the author suggests that cheap Chinese goods have made life more affordable for average Americans. The piece questions the validity of claims about mass job losses, pointing to research that defends the economic benefits of trade with China. This perspective offers a counterargument to the prevailing anti-China sentiment in U.S. politics and economics.</p>
