          <p>Pep Guardiola addressed his decision to exclude Jack Grealish from Manchester City's squad for their final game of the season. Despite securing a Champions League spot with a 2-0 victory over Fulham, Guardiola faces questions about Grealish's future amid expected summer changes to the squad. Guardiola dismissed suggestions of unhappiness with Grealish, emphasizing his support for the player's arrival and continued presence at the club. The manager clarified that his selection decisions were not personal, and that future player acquisitions are the responsibility of Txiki Begiristain and Hugo Viana.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a 29-year-old entrepreneur is advocating for a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting," emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach focuses on creating a safe space for children to express big emotions without judgment, viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents set boundaries with empathy, prevent shame, and prioritize open communication. The framework encourages parents to do their own inner work to become less reactive and create an environment where children feel accepted and understood.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul secured a victory in his first-round match at the French Open shortly after having his truck repossessed due to missed payments. Paul, seeded 12th, defeated Elmer Moller in four sets, and humorously recounted the ordeal of his Ford F-150 being taken away after he forgot to update his automatic payments following a bank change. The incident was discovered when Paul's trainer asked him to check security camera footage for packages, revealing the repossession instead. After figuring out what had happened, Paul posted the black-and-white footage of his truck being towed away, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion‚Äôs My Heart Will Go On.</p>
