          <p>Democrats are reportedly moving away from using 'woke' jargon in an attempt to win back voters who previously supported Donald Trump. Party figures have expressed concern that phrases such as "Latinx" and an overemphasis on issues like pronouns have alienated ordinary voters. Some Democrats are advocating for simpler language to connect with a broader electorate and avoid appearing out of touch. The shift comes after criticism of Kamala Harris's use of complex and confusing language during the 2024 presidential election.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend several strategies to escape the payday loan debt cycle, including negotiating with lenders for structured repayment plans and seeking professional guidance from credit counseling agencies. Alternatives to high-interest loans include personal loans from banks, reduced interest rates on credit cards, and assistance from family members. Building an emergency fund through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation options can also help break the cycle. Enrolling in a debt management plan (DMP) through a nonprofit counseling agency can consolidate debts and reduce interest rates, though it may temporarily lower credit scores.

          <p>As George Lucas's Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles approaches completion, Lucas has stepped back into a leading role, parting ways with the museum's director and reorganizing staff. The museum, plagued by delays and questions about its mission, is now slated to open next year. Lucas has installed himself as the head of "content direction," aiming to share his extensive collection of art and memorabilia with the public. The move signals a renewed focus on Lucas's vision for the institution.</p>
