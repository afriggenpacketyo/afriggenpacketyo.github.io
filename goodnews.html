          <p>Billy Boston, a legendary figure in rugby league, is set to become the sport's first-ever knight. The 90-year-old Cardiff-born player, who starred for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, will receive the honor at Buckingham Palace due to concerns over his health. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy hailed the knighthood as an "historic milestone" and a recognition of rugby league's contribution to national life. The move follows frustration over the lack of rugby league knighthoods, with MPs suggesting snobbery was a factor. The event is a celebration of a sporting icon and a long-overdue recognition for the sport.</p>

          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on the set of 'It Ends With Us.' Lively had filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. Baldoni's countersuit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career with false accusations, but the judge ruled Baldoni failed to prove extortion or defamation. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, and Lively expressed resolve to stand for every woman's right to have a voice in protecting themselves. The ruling provides a sense of resolution in a contentious legal battle.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a federal program providing $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American babies, with backing from business leaders who plan to contribute billions more. The "Trump accounts" would be tax-deferred investment accounts tracking stock market performance for children born between 2025 and 2029. The program has passed the House as part of a budget bill but faces Senate Republican resistance. The congressional budget office has found that the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt while cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs. The initiative aims to provide a financial head start for future generations, but its feasibility depends on legislative approval and economic factors. (not investment advice)</p>
