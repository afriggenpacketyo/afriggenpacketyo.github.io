          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum suggests that removing fluoride from public water systems would lead to a significant increase in tooth decay and dental care costs for children in the United States. Researchers estimate that stopping water fluoridation would result in 25.4 million additional cases of tooth decay and cost $9.8 billion over five years. The study highlights that publicly insured and uninsured children would be disproportionately affected. The addition of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered a major public health achievement, aiding in preventing tooth decay.</p>
