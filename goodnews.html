        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has responded to President Trump's executive order aimed at ceasing direct funding to NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress, not the president, controls its funding. CPB President Patricia Harrison emphasized the corporation's independence from the federal government, citing congressional mandates that forbid any government agency from exercising control over educational broadcasting. The executive order seeks to block federal funding to NPR and PBS and prevent indirect funding through local stations. PBS President Paula Kerger warned that such funding cuts would disproportionately affect rural communities that rely on public broadcasting for essential services, including children's programming and emergency alerts. The order also directs agencies to investigate potential unlawful discrimination by NPR and PBS.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law to bolster its private economy, set to take effect on May 20. Observers are closely monitoring the implementation of the law to determine its effectiveness, particularly in enabling firms to challenge local governments in court and protecting them from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Economics professor Rui Meng believes the law's provisions on curbing administrative powers will empower entrepreneurs to pursue litigation, especially against local governments. The law, comprising 78 articles, is the first of its kind and is seen as evidence of Beijing's commitment to revitalizing the non-state economy, forbidding administrative intervention in economic disputes and unscrupulous fine collections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denver Fire Station 3, the city's oldest operating firehouse, is recognized for its historical significance as the only station where Black firefighters were assigned until desegregation in 1957. The station, known as the "Pride of the Points," fostered a commitment to excellence and community service. Firefighters like Sidney Frelow and Charles Cousins took great pride in their work, becoming role models within Denver's Five Points community. Despite facing racial hurdles, these firefighters made significant contributions, with some even losing their lives in the line of duty, such as during the St. James fire in 1895. Retired Fire Chief Rod Juniel, who had to fight to join the department in the 1970s, emphasizes the need to continue addressing equitable service within the fire department.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has strategically invited King Charles III and Queen Camilla to visit Canada later this month, aiming to underscore Canada's sovereignty amid strained relations with the U.S. and President Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state. Carney's upcoming visit to the White House will address tariffs and the broader relationship between the two countries. Carney also offered an olive branch to political rivals, emphasizing the need for unity and addressing cost of living and safety concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system's foundational principles. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients Trump disliked. Howell framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an assault on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system, noting the order stigmatized the firm and its employees. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms, while the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I" is intended as an additional proclamation, not a replacement of Veterans Day. The clarification came after Trump's social media post sparked confusion. Establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval, according to the Congressional Research Service. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of people diagnosed with autism has risen significantly, prompting questions about whether there are genuinely more autistic individuals or if changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness are responsible. Studies show an exponential increase in autism diagnoses, particularly among women and adults. The definition of autism has broadened over time, and there's a better understanding of how autism presents differently in women and individuals with lower support needs. While some worry about the potential for glamorizing autism, others argue that the increase in diagnoses reflects a positive trend of identifying and supporting those who previously went undiagnosed.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a key challenger to Britain's traditional main parties. The party won hundreds of seats, seizing control of several authorities from the Conservatives and displacing Labour in some areas. Reform UK also secured its first mayoral contests. Farage hailed the results as evidence that Reform has surpassed the Tories as the main opposition to Labour. The elections also marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory last year.</p>

          <p>Canada's Conservatives are grappling with their recent election loss, despite having held a significant lead in opinion polls. The party gained seats but failed to win the election for the fourth consecutive time, and leader Pierre Poilievre lost his own seat. The party is now working to determine how to move forward, with Poilievre planning to run in a special election to regain a seat. While Poilievre has support within the party, questions are being raised about where the campaign fell short.</p>
