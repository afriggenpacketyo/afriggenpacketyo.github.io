          <p>Taylor Swift has refuted claims made by actor Justin Baldoni's legal team that she had agreed to be deposed in his ongoing legal dispute with his "It Ends With Us" co-star, Blake Lively. Swift's lawyer stated she has "no material role" in the case and would only testify if compelled by the court, highlighting that her schedule could only accommodate it in late October. This development is the latest in a series of lawsuits between Lively and Baldoni, which began with allegations of sexual harassment on set. Baldoni's team is accused of trying to involve Swift to create a media spectacle.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on data analytics company Palantir, stating he is "so inspired" by its high market valuation while also taking a jab at its pricing. Speaking at a technology conference, Benioff noted Palantir's "extraordinary" prices are the "most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen," jokingly suggesting Salesforce might not be charging enough. While Salesforce is ten times larger by revenue, Palantir is growing significantly faster. The comments highlight the competitive dynamic between the two companies, which sometimes vie for the same government contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has canceled its plans to develop a fully electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing a slowdown in demand for battery electric trucks in North America. The vehicle was originally expected to launch by the end of 2024 but had already faced multiple delays. Instead of a fully electric model, the company will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which will be equipped with both an electric generator and a gasoline engine. This strategic shift reflects a broader reassessment of product strategy under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa amid changing market conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, accusing it of operating as an illegal sports gambling business without the required license. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi is offering sports-related wagers under the guise of "events contracts." The state is seeking a court order to halt Kalshi's sports-related offerings in Massachusetts while the case is pending. Kalshi has previously argued that its regulation by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission should supersede state-level gambling laws, a key point of contention in the legal battle.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of conspiracies related to his 2022 reelection loss, sentencing him to over 27 years in prison and barring him from future office. This article draws parallels between Bolsonaro and U.S. President Donald Trump, noting both leaders challenged democratic norms, vilified opponents, and attempted to cling to power after electoral defeats. President Trump had reportedly tried to intervene on Bolsonaro's behalf, viewing the case as political persecution. The author suggests Brazil's decisive action to hold a former leader accountable for undermining democracy offers a stark contrast to the ongoing legal and political battles in the United States.</p>
