          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine "Article 5-like" security protections.

The potential agreement would mirror NATO's collective defense clause, a key Ukrainian objective, without requiring formal NATO membership. European and Ukrainian leaders have cautiously welcomed the news, emphasizing the need for practical and detailed implementation of such guarantees to ensure a lasting peace.</p>

The 22-year-old seamer, who was recently called up to England's national squad, secured his final two wickets on consecutive balls to end the Superchargers' innings at 114. The Originals had set a target of 172, anchored by an unbeaten 64 from captain Jos Buttler and a late surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out.

The patient, Morie Abibu, was paralyzed from the neck down by a growing mass on his spinal cord. The complex operation at Connaught Hospital faced challenges like power outages but ultimately restored some movement in the patient's toes hours later. Dr. Kamara's practice was established through a grassroots effort involving international nonprofits like Mission Brain, which arranged his training and helped supply the necessary equipment.</p>

          <p>Actor Adam Scott discusses his Emmy-nominated lead role in the Apple TV+ series "Severance," a part he describes as both terrifying and a career-long aspiration. Known for comedic roles in shows like "Parks and Recreation," Scott embraced the challenge of playing a character whose work and personal memories are surgically divided. Director Ben Stiller praised Scott's technical skill in portraying the two distinct personalities. The show has become a critical and popular success, resonating with audiences for its surreal exploration of work-life balance, and solidifying Scott's transition into a leading dramatic actor after a 30-year career.</p>

          <p>Several European and NATO leaders will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a crucial meeting with President Trump at the White House. This collective move is seen as an effort to present a united front and support Zelenskyy, particularly after he was excluded from Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin. Leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO chief Mark Rutte, and the leaders of France and Germany will attend. The presence of the European delegation aims to ensure their perspectives are included in U.S.-led peace negotiations and to prevent a repeat of a previous contentious meeting.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Goal Disallowed Due to Attacking Player's Proximity to Defensive Wall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:06:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a rule infringement. The decision was made because a Palace player was positioned less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall at the moment the kick was taken. According to Law 13 of the game, introduced in the 2019-20 season, when a defending team forms a wall of three or more players, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance. The rule was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting caused by attackers in the wall.</p>
