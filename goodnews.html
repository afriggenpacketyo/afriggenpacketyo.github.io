        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Significant tax changes for inherited IRAs are set to take effect in 2025, potentially imposing a 25% IRS penalty for non-spouse heirs who fail to take required minimum distributions (RMDs). Under the "10-year rule," most beneficiaries must deplete inherited accounts within a decade, with annual RMDs now mandated if the original owner reached RMD age before death. Financial experts advise early planning and strategic withdrawals to navigate these complex regulations and avoid substantial tax hits, especially as wealth transfers to adult children. This article outlines crucial steps to ensure compliance and minimize financial risk (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is advocating for the permanent abolition of daylight saving time (DST) in the EU by 2026, arguing that the twice-annual clock change no longer saves energy and negatively impacts health. This move revives a debate the European Commission has pursued since 2018, when a survey showed 85% of Europeans opposed DST. Despite broad popular sentiment, a lack of unanimity among member states on whether to adopt permanent summer or winter time has stalled previous efforts. The Commission is now undertaking further analysis to support future decision-making on this divisive issue.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are experiencing significant volatility, with recent crashes and rebounds reflecting a tug-of-war between various market dynamics. Factors like Federal Rate cut expectations, a weaker dollar, and a resilient stock market are influencing gold's price, alongside persistent inflation which recently hit 3%. Historically, gold acts as an inflation hedge and safe haven, but its relationship with inflation is complex, also depending on central bank decisions and global demand. Investors should consider gold as a diversification tool within a balanced portfolio, rather than a sole safeguard against inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced it will monitor polling sites in five California counties for Proposition 50, a ballot measure seeking to redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats. This decision follows a request from state GOP officials citing "irregularities" in past elections. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the DOJ's commitment to "transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law," aiming to ensure fair and free elections. The monitoring, while routine, faces heightened scrutiny given former President Trump's election denial claims and the partisan nature of the redistricting proposition.</p>

The extradition follows pressure from the Trump administration on Mexico and China to curb fentanyl trafficking, a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin.
