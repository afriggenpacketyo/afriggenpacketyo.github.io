          <p>Leicester City has appointed Marti Cifuentes as their new manager on a three-year contract, replacing Ruud van Nistelrooy just before the start of the new season. The 43-year-old Spaniard joins the club after their immediate relegation from the Premier League, with the primary expectation being a swift return to the top flight. Cifuentes is known for his work at Queens Park Rangers, where he successfully guided the team away from relegation threats in the Championship. Leicester's leadership expressed confidence that his modern and progressive football philosophy is an excellent fit for the club's future ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Enmanji Teriyaki Barbecue in Sebastopol, California, recently celebrated its 70th anniversary, an event rooted in community healing and cross-cultural friendship. The annual gathering, hosted by the Enmanji Buddhist Temple, is famous for its secret-recipe teriyaki chicken and draws thousands of visitors. The event's history is deeply connected to the post-WWII era, when local non-Japanese residents protected the temple from vandalism after Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps. This act of solidarity fostered a strong community bond that has endured for decades, turning the barbecue into a powerful symbol of acceptance and shared history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that he has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports to the U.S. Trump described it as a "great deal, for everybody" but did not provide any specific details, stating they would be released later. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later suggested the agreement involves Indonesia dropping its tariffs on American goods. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent deal declared with Vietnam, which was also initially vague and reportedly surprised Vietnamese officials. Indonesia is a significant trading partner, with a U.S. trade deficit of $17.9 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>In The Atlantic's "Dear James" advice column, a reader seeks guidance on how to cope with unbearable guilt from a past, mutually abusive relationship. The reader describes a toxic cycle with an alcoholic ex-partner that involved emotional manipulation, harassment, and an unplanned pregnancy, which was ultimately terminated. Despite being in a healthy relationship now and having undergone therapy, he struggles to forgive himself for his cruel behavior during that time. Columnist James Parker advises that the reader has already taken responsibility and that the lingering guilt is now "unemployed negativity," urging him to let go and fully engage with his present reality.</p>

CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance, noting it was the best second quarter for equities since 2020. Despite the positive results, the bank also reported a 16% increase in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook as a reason for building its allowance for credit losses.

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedoes during a pivotal World War II battle near the Solomon Islands in 1942. The warship was found more than 2,600 feet below the surface in Iron Bottom Sound, a region known for its numerous naval battle wrecks. The remotely operated vehicle that located the Teruzuki revealed it was still armed with unused depth charges, and its discovery has disproven a long-held theory about the cause of its sinking. The finding provides a rare glimpse into a historically significant vessel, as no images of it were known to exist.</p>
