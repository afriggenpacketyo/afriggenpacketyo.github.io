        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency grants. The decision sides with 20 primarily Democratic states that sued, arguing the policy illegally held critical disaster preparedness funding hostage. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the rule to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," representing a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to penalize so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. This ruling affirms that the executive branch cannot unilaterally add such conditions to congressionally approved funding.</p>

The popular online contest allows the public to vote for the bear they believe has best prepared for winter hibernation by gaining a substantial amount of weight. This event highlights the critical biological process where bears can gain hundreds of pounds, a sign of good health and a key to their survival through the winter.

          <p>An inexpensive, generic drug called leucovorin, typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, is being studied for its potential to help children with autism improve their speech. The article highlights the story of a boy who was nonverbal until he began taking the drug, which is derived from folic acid. Researchers theorize that some children with autism have a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which leucovorin can bypass. While preliminary studies are positive, challenges remain in securing funding for larger clinical trials and FDA approval, as the drug's generic status offers little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in western and northern Venezuela, according to the US Geological Survey. The epicenter was located at a relatively shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers near Mene Grande, an oil town in a sparsely populated area of Zulia state. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties following the seismic event. The region is part of a seismically active zone, though large, damaging earthquakes are not frequent. Authorities are currently assessing the situation for any potential impact on the local population and infrastructure.</p>

He clarified that he never intended to make light of the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and thanked a wide range of supporters, including prominent conservatives who defended his right to free speech. Kimmel explained his disagreement with the network's decision to pull the show but acknowledged they ultimately welcomed him back. The episode highlighted the intense debate over censorship and the role of political commentary in media.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly six decades, a Syrian president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, addressed the U.N. General Assembly, signaling a new era for the country after the fall of the Assad dynasty. In his speech, al-Sharaa declared that Syria is rejoining the international community and promised to bring those responsible for past atrocities to justice. He also discussed ongoing security negotiations with Israel and called for the lifting of international sanctions to help rebuild the nation. The historic appearance prompted both celebrations and protests among the Syrian diaspora, reflecting the country's deep divisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Celtic's opening draw in the Europa League against Red Star Belgrade, manager Brendan Rodgers has called for "realism" regarding the team's current standing in European football. After a three-year spell in the more prestigious Champions League, the club's performance and recent lack of significant transfer activity suggest a new norm has been established. Rodgers framed the away point as a "good platform" for a squad that is weaker than in previous seasons. The manager's comments reflect a strategic shift in managing expectations for both the players and the fanbase.</p>

The decision to pay the U.S. players has drawn criticism, with some arguing it goes against the traditional ethos of the event. Donald emphasized that for his team, the competition is about pride, legacy, and representing their flag.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attacks on ABC and Jimmy Kimmel have created an unusual political alignment, with several high-profile conservatives defending the late-night host on free speech grounds. Figures like Senator Ted Cruz warned that embracing government regulation to silence disagreeable voices sets a dangerous precedent that could later be used against conservatives. This reaction came after an FCC commissioner suggested regulatory consequences for stations airing Kimmel's show. The situation has fueled a sharp debate about whether the administration is attempting to illegally silence critics or simply level the media playing field.</p>
