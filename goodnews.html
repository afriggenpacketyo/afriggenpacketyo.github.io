          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced increased funding for the National Health Service (NHS) in England and housing, while some other departments face budget cuts. The Spending Review includes an extra ¬£29 billion per year for the NHS and significant investment in social and affordable housing, as well as funding for artificial intelligence and transport projects. Some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will see reduced day-to-day spending. The government hopes that increased spending in health and investment in long-term projects will reassure voters, but many departments will still have to grapple with frugal spending allocations. The opposition criticizes the plan as a "spend now, tax later review".</p>

          <p>David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and activist, is stepping down as Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair after facing criticism for his plan to support primary challenges against incumbent Democrats. Hogg's decision follows a vote to redo the DNC vice chair elections, although the revote was not directly related to his primary challenge plan. He stated that there was a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair and that he needed to focus on his organization, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to elect young leaders. DNC Chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision, while other party figures expressed relief at the resolution of the intraparty conflict.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 documented a mysterious new star, now confirmed to be a nova, with unprecedented details. The record, rediscovered in a formal report to the emperor, describes the star's size, brightness, and color, helping modern astronomers narrow down its possible position. This discovery settles a debate about the nature of the 1408 event, distinguishing it from a comet or meteor. The astronomers interpreted the star's appearance as a heavenly endorsement of the emperor's reign, highlighting the intersection of science and politics in ancient China.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons studied belonged to a species that is now the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the iconic T.rex. This discovery sheds light on how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants, with features like skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. The new species represents a transitional fossil between earlier ancestors and the mighty tyrannosaurs.</p>
