          <p>Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net bookings also showing strong demand. The company, a critical supplier for top chipmakers like TSMC and Intel, benefited from system upgrades and lower-than-expected tariff impacts. However, ASML provided a cautious outlook, with its third-quarter revenue forecast falling short of market predictions. Citing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, the company stated it is preparing for growth in 2026 but cannot confirm it at this stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the end of deployment for 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which is about half the force sent to the city in response to protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The withdrawal follows legal challenges from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued the federal deployment was unlawful and depleted resources needed for wildfire season. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the decision as a victory for peaceful protest and local unity against what she termed a political maneuver. The remaining troops currently lack a clear mission.</p>

          <p>Twenty years before the 2025 Open Championship, a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy shot a historic course-record 61 at Royal Portrush, an event still vividly recalled by those who witnessed it. His playing partners from that day remember a supremely confident teenager whose gallery swelled as word of his incredible performance spread across the course. McIlroy's bogey-free round, which included an eagle and five consecutive birdies to finish, was seen as a clear sign of his future superstardom. The article contrasts that early, unshakeable confidence with the professional pressures and near-misses he has since endured.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the viral Labubu toy craze, dropped over 6% despite the company forecasting a profit increase of at least 350% for the first half of the year. The negative stock reaction may reflect investor concern that the company's explosive growth has peaked and could slow in the second half. While some analysts believe the stock is overvalued due to uncertainty over its intellectual properties' longevity, others remain bullish. The company attributes its strong performance to global brand recognition and expansion into overseas markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The case revisits a pivotal moment in the nation's history and a deeply polarizing figure, with some viewing Kim as a patriot and others as a traitor.
