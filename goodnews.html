          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin escaped on May 25 by impersonating a corrections officer, prompting a manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. He was apprehended approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit after tracking dogs picked up his scent. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement for their efforts in bringing the search to a peaceful conclusion, highlighting the assistance from a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit. His capture brings relief to the community, especially after the Stone County Sheriff expressed fears that Hardin might harm someone. The optimism score is unrelated to the events that transpired.</p>

          <p>Sunny Jacobs, who became a celebrity after being freed from death row, has died at the age of 77. Jacobs, along with her husband and a friend, was wrongly convicted of murdering two police officers in 1976 and spent 17 years in prison before being exonerated. Her story gained widespread attention and was adapted into an Off Broadway play and television movies. However, an investigator later questioned the accuracy of her story in a 2021 book, casting doubt on some of the details surrounding her case and conviction. Jacobs' experience highlighted the flaws in the justice system and the challenges faced by wrongfully convicted individuals.</p>

          <p>Walmart is implementing new strategies to attract younger shoppers amidst rising tariffs and economic uncertainty. These efforts include a fresh advertising campaign, a new clothing brand designed for tweens called Weekend Academy, and the expansion of drone deliveries to 100 stores in three states. The company aims to gain market share by offering better items and more convenience to value-conscious shoppers across income levels. Walmart CFO John David Rainey noted that tariffs have not changed consumer spending patterns, with shoppers spending more on groceries and less on discretionary items. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon defended the decision to announce price increases due to tariffs, emphasizing the company's responsibility to communicate with shareholders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional, affirming that teaching yoga is protected speech. The court sided with two instructors who sued over a 2024 law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The city argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as the instructors' free classes drew donations. One instructor, who had been cited multiple times, resumed teaching classes, emphasizing that outdoor yoga is a service for those who are disabled or cannot afford classes elsewhere. The ruling is seen as a victory for community access and free expression.</p>
