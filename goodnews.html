          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 Pacifica and Voyager minivans from model years 2022-2025 due to a potential airbag defect. The side curtain airbags may have improperly sealed seams, which could prevent them from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes, increasing injury risk. The company has stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue and is urging owners to follow recall instructions. Dealers will inspect and replace the airbags for free if necessary.</p>

          <p>Despite a police ban and threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, tens of thousands participated in the Budapest Pride march, with organizers estimating a record turnout. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the government's restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and broader civil liberties in Hungary. Budapest's mayor declared the parade a municipal event to circumvent the ban, and the march received significant support from over 30 embassies and numerous European officials. The defiance comes amid a growing political challenge to Orban's nationalist government.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team secured a commanding 97-run victory over England in the first T20 match, largely due to a remarkable performance by Smriti Mandhana.

England's response was faltering, as they were bowled out for 113, marking their heaviest T20 defeat in terms of runs.

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its commitment to remove all artificial colors from its products by the end of 2027. This move includes products from its recently acquired Hostess brand, such as Twinkies and Snoballs, which currently use synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5. The company noted that most of its portfolio, including Uncrustables, is already free from these additives. This decision aligns Smucker with other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar pledges amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial food dyes.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their tour of Australia with a decisive victory over the Western Force, scoring over 50 points. However, the win was marred by a hamstring injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had been in excellent form. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed concern over the injury, which could necessitate calling up a replacement. The match also highlighted areas for improvement, particularly a high penalty count in the first half, which Farrell attributed to players' overeagerness to make an impression on the tour's opening game.</p>

According to this industry guideline, the ideal property should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, like location and layout. Another 10% should consist of things you can improve over time, such as paint or countertops, while the final 10% are imperfections you can learn to live with. The agent also proposes a "L.O.V.E.
