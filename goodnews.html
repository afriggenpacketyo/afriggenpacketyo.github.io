          <h2>Taiwanese Voters Reject Mass Recall of Opposition Kuomintang Lawmakers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political event, Taiwanese voters have rejected an attempt to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The result is seen as a setback for President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to regain a parliamentary majority. The recall was initiated by civic groups following legislative moves by the KMT and its allies to expand parliamentary powers, which critics argued were overly pro-China. The KMT framed the outcome as a public desire for stability over political infighting.</p>

Meanwhile, overall leader Tadej Pogačar finished safely within the peloton, effectively guaranteeing his fourth Tour de France championship ahead of the final processional stage in Paris. Groves' emotional win completes his trilogy of stage victories across all three Grand Tours. Pogačar's dominance also secured him the King of the Mountains title for the third time, capping a successful tour for the Slovenian rider.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, fueled by optimism from a new trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with China and the EU. This strong performance comes during a busy earnings season, where a majority of S&P 500 companies have so far beaten expectations. Housing data showed mixed price trends, with existing home prices rising while new home prices fell, an important indicator for inflation. Several major companies, including GE Vernova and Danaher, reported strong quarterly results, boosting investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's private visit, during which he played golf at his Turnberry resort. While the day passed without major incident at the resort, hundreds of protesters gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to demonstrate against his visit, citing his political stances and the cost to taxpayers. During the trip, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has reignited debate over public funding for events at his properties and the large-scale police resources required.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating his teammate Oscar Piastri in a challenging qualifying session. Norris's first lap in the final session was enough to secure the top spot, as Piastri made a small mistake on his faster second attempt. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, ahead of championship leader Max Verstappen, who was disappointed with his own performance in the final qualifying run. With rain expected for the race, Norris's front-row start could provide a crucial advantage in potentially chaotic conditions.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old man diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, has made a remarkable recovery after a successful double-lung transplant. Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy was resistant to the idea of a transplant but eventually agreed to the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic. Despite post-surgery complications, his lung capacity is now at 98%, and he is resuming his life's passions, including training hospital therapy dogs. His story highlights the devastating nature of IPF and the life-saving potential of organ transplantation.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was notably absent from the team's friendly match against AC Milan, a decision manager Arne Slot confirmed was due to ongoing transfer speculation. The Premier League champions recently rejected a £58 million bid from Bayern Munich for the Colombian player, whose future at the club now appears uncertain. Liverpool has been active in the transfer market, signing other forwards, which has further fueled rumors that Diaz may be on his way out of Anfield. The team went on to lose the friendly match 4-2 in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>According to sources, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China this autumn, with officials in Washington and Beijing working to arrange a trip for October or November. A previously rumored September visit is reportedly no longer being considered. The potential summit could occur either as a standalone bilateral visit or in conjunction with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. The discussions follow a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was described as positive and a crucial step toward a leader-level engagement.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation Encourages More Employers to Offer Student Loan Repayment Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:59:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in the recent "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that makes employer contributions to student loan repayments permanently tax-free is encouraging more companies to offer this benefit. The act allows employers to contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans without it being taxed, a measure that was previously temporary. As federal loan repayment options narrow, workplace benefits are becoming a more critical lifeline for workers burdened by debt. This development is seen as a key tool for companies to attract and retain talent. (not investment advice)</p>

Krynina records interviews with prisoners, delivers parcels, and aims to show Russians the reality of the war. Her work has placed her on Russia's "foreign agents" list, but she continues, believing every returned Russian prisoner also means a Ukrainian soldier can come home.</p>

          <p>Brazil is ramping up a novel public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria to fight the spread of dengue and other viruses. The bacteria, harmless to humans, prevent the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, effectively stopping its transmission. A successful pilot program in the city of Niterói saw dengue cases plummet by 90%, prompting the government to build a massive new factory capable of producing 5 billion of these "Wolbitos" annually. The goal is to protect 140 million Brazilians over the next decade.</p>

Ten women who achieved top scores on their university entrance exams were accepted into the prestigious military institution.
