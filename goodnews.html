          <h2>Elon Musk's Ventures Gain Momentum in India, Shifting from Ambition to Action</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's long-standing ambitions in India are finally materializing, with Tesla opening its first showroom in Mumbai and Starlink receiving regulatory approval for commercial services. This shift comes after years of stalled plans and regulatory hurdles, indicating a new phase in his global strategy, especially as his relationships in China and the U.S. become more complex. While India offers a vast growth market and aligns with the country's "Make in India" initiative, the current focus is on the premium segment for Tesla, and Starlink's high cost suggests a target of government contracts and remote businesses. The article suggests that while significant groundwork is being laid, the long-term success of Musk's ventures in India remains to be seen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-on-year rise in second-quarter profit, surpassing estimates, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company projects a 38% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue, reaching $31.8 billion to $33.0 billion, and anticipates full-year 2025 revenue to grow by approximately 30%. This growth is primarily driven by advanced chip technologies (7-nanometer or smaller), which accounted for 74% of its wafer revenue. The article highlights TSMC's strong position in the AI boom, despite potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies and global macroeconomic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Rihanna's Smurfette Role Challenges and Reflects on Pop Culture's "Smurfette Principle"</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rihanna stars as Smurfette in the new animated musical film "Smurfs," a role that brings attention to the "Smurfette principle," a sexist pop culture trope where a single female character is surrounded by an all-male ensemble. While the film attempts to empower Smurfette, critics argue that previous franchise efforts to reverse gender roles have also drawn criticism for different reasons. The article explores how the character's evolution reflects broader discussions about gender representation in media and the commercial motivations behind such changes. It also touches upon recent controversies, including the misuse of the Smurf brand by far-right groups in Germany.</p>

          <p>The European Union's executive arm has proposed a €2 trillion ($2.31 trillion) seven-year budget starting in 2028, allocating a substantial €131 billion to defense and space, a fivefold increase from current spending.
