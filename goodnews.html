          <h2>New Regulations Mandate Solar Panels for Most New Homes in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 19:59:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government is set to introduce regulations requiring developers to install solar panels on the majority of new homes in England, with Energy Secretary Ed Miliband championing the move as "common sense." The regulations, part of the Future Homes Standard, aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, potentially saving households ¬£500 annually on energy bills. While the Home Builders Federation supports the initiative, they caution against overly burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes. The government plans to publish the detailed rules in the autumn, including potential exemptions and coverage percentages for solar panels.</p>

CEO Hock Tan anticipates continued growth in AI revenue into fiscal year 2026, citing strong partnerships with companies like Alphabet, Meta, and ByteDance. The company's success in converting VMware customers to subscription-based accounts also contributed to the positive results (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzed stocks reaching new 52-week highs to understand current market trends, highlighting companies like Broadcom, Seagate, and Johnson Controls. He noted the absence of major tech names due to trade tensions with China, but pointed to the success of subscription-based businesses like Netflix and Spotify. Cramer also mentioned Cintas as a positive sign for the broader economy, given its contracts with blue-collar employers. He suggested investors consider buying these stocks if they drop 5 to 8% from their current levels (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of whether they are part of a majority or minority group. The justices rejected the notion that members of a majority group must provide more evidence of discrimination to sue and win. The ruling revives a lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. The court clarified that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against "any individual" based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, including sexual orientation.</p>
