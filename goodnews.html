          <h2>Financial Experts Advise on Common Mistakes to Avoid When a Certificate of Deposit Matures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 09:45:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on critical missteps to avoid as high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) from the 2023-2024 period begin to mature. A primary warning is against allowing CDs to automatically renew, as renewal rates are often significantly lower than the original promotional rates. Experts also caution against chasing the highest available rate without considering the term length, which could lock up funds needed sooner. Instead, they recommend reevaluating personal financial goals to align savings strategies with future needs, such as using a high-yield savings account for more liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eric Flores, an Army veteran and former federal prosecutor, has officially launched his Republican campaign for Texas's 34th Congressional District, a key swing district targeted by the GOP. In his announcement, Flores aligned himself with President Trump and emphasized his background in fighting cartels and human trafficking as an assistant U.S. attorney. He aims to unseat incumbent Democrat Vicente Gonzalez in a district that has been trending Republican, with Trump winning it by nearly five points in the last presidential election. The race is expected to be highly competitive in the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <h2>China's National Nuclear Corporation Achieves Record Depth in Sandstone Uranium Exploration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 09:30:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has reported a significant breakthrough in uranium exploration, setting a new national depth record for discovering a sandstone-type uranium deposit. This type of deposit is considered highly valuable as it is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine compared to other sources like volcanic rock. The discovery underscores China's advancing technological capabilities in resource exploration. This development is crucial for the country, which is heavily reliant on uranium imports to fuel its nuclear power and weapons programs.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Backed by major crypto investors, the firm plans to replicate MicroStrategy's successful bitcoin accumulation but will focus on ether, differentiating itself by generating yield through staking. The company's chairman highlighted that this approach makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as staking provides a dividend-like return that current ether ETFs do not offer. This launch comes as institutional interest in ether grows, partly due to new regulatory clarity. (not investment advice)</p>

Though devastated at the time, Mallick says the harsh feedback was what she needed to hear, prompting her to actively practice and improve her communication skills.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the significant developmental benefits children gain from participating in household chores, arguing that many modern parents miss this opportunity. Researchers suggest that chores help develop executive function, motor skills, and a sense of responsibility and self-efficacy. While toddlers are often eager to help, parents may discourage them for efficiency's sake, inadvertently diminishing their enthusiasm. The piece advises parents to involve children early, make chores a collaborative activity, and avoid turning them into micromanaged lessons, thereby fostering a sense of belonging and contribution within the family.</p>

          <p>The price of gold, currently around $3,362 per ounce, is influenced by a complex interplay of economic factors, making it a key commodity for investors. Its value is largely driven by supply and demand, global economic conditions, and its traditional role as a hedge against inflation. During times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset, which can drive up its price. Other significant factors include interest rates, currency fluctuations, and the policies of central banks that hold large gold reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A biologist explains that heart cancer is extremely rare primarily because adult heart cells divide very infrequently, a process that dramatically declines after age 20. Cancer arises from mutations that occur during cell division, so the low rate of division in heart cells provides fewer opportunities for such errors to occur. Additionally, the heart's protected location within the chest shields it from direct exposure to many carcinogens. While this resistance to cancer is beneficial, it also means the heart has a very limited ability to repair itself after injury or disease.</p>
