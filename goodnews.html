          <p>President Trump expressed optimism regarding upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, emphasizing the potential to save lives and rebuild through trade. This follows Putin's unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine reported was violated, and Zelenskyy's counter-offer of a 30-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy called Putin's offer for direct talks in Istanbul a "positive sign," expressing readiness to meet if Russia confirms a lasting ceasefire starting May 12. Despite previous failed attempts, both leaders are showing tentative signs of willingness to engage in negotiations to end the three-year conflict.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article is a guest essay by Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, who encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and cut themselves some slack. She argues that being flawed is an important part of motherhood, as it teaches children to accept their own imperfections. The article addresses the constant pressure mothers face from various sources, including books, influencers, and even their own children, suggesting they might not be doing enough. Ross includes a lighthearted quiz to help mothers recognize and embrace their imperfections, ultimately urging them to stop wondering if they are good enough.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but below last year's rate. Meanwhile, the rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a subdued spring home-buying season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump described the first day of high-level trade talks between American and Chinese officials in Switzerland as "very good," signaling a potential "total reset" in US-China trade relations. The talks, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng, aim to de-escalate the ongoing trade war, which has seen tariffs of over 100% imposed on goods from both countries. While Washington seeks an opening of China to American business, Beijing reportedly decided to engage after considering global expectations and appeals from American businesses.</p>

          <p>A report by ODI Global indicates that China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested US$66 billion in Africa's energy sector, making the continent a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This trend aligns with China's commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas and reflects Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
