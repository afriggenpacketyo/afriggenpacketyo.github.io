          <p>The UK has been temporarily exempted from President Trump's executive order which would have doubled steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. This carve-out follows discussions between UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The exemption is contingent upon the UK's compliance with the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed in May 2025, with potential tariff increases possible after July 9, 2025, if compliance is not met. The UK government is working with the US to fully implement the agreement and remove tariffs, but uncertainty remains for UK steel exporters. (not investment advice)</p>
