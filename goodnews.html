        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the age of 75, music legend Stevie Wonder has declared he has no plans to retire, stating he will continue playing as long as he is breathing. This comes after a well-received UK tour and confirms his ongoing work on a new album, "Through The Eyes Of Wonder," his first since 2005. Wonder views his songs as timeless statements from his spirit and sees performing them as essential as breathing. The article also touches on his role as a civil rights advocate, with Wonder expressing concern that America is currently experiencing a regressive trend, though he remains hopeful that people will awaken to the truth.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 116-year history, Girlguiding has introduced a new set of 72 badges to keep the organization relevant to modern girls' interests. The new additions were developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers and include contemporary activities and skills. Badges now available range from 'laughter' and 'bee rescuer' for the youngest members to 'fandoms' for Rangers interested in pop culture like Taylor Swift, and 'booktivist' for learning about empowerment through reading. The update aims to build confidence and address current issues while maintaining the organization's core values of fun and education outside of school.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Announces National Inquiry into 1984 'Battle of Orgreave' Miners' Strike Clash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has officially confirmed a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers clashing with striking miners at a coking plant in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what she called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the news, hoping it will finally bring truth and justice to the affected mining communities.</p>

          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game broadcast, ESPN host Elle Duncan made an off-color joke about the lack of defense, comparing it to a "girls' trip to Cancun" where there is "no D." The comment drew immediate on-air reactions from her colleagues and subsequently generated a mixed response on social media. Some viewers criticized the remark as unprofessional, while others defended it as harmless humor. The incident occurred at halftime of the high-scoring game, which ultimately saw Napheesa Collier's team defeat Caitlin Clark's team 151-131. Clark did not participate in the game due to a nagging groin injury.</p>

          <p>Once overshadowed by tequila, artisanal mezcal is now a booming half-billion-dollar industry, gaining prominence in high-end bars and restaurants worldwide. The spirit, primarily produced in Oaxaca, Mexico, is crafted by hand in a traditional process by family-owned distilleries, or palenques. The article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who, after migrating to the U.S. for work, returned to Mexico to expand their family business. Their partnership with American entrepreneur John Rexer and a subsequent acquisition by Bacardi has transformed their local operation into a global success, benefiting their entire community.</p>

Designed to guide students toward answers rather than simply providing them, the tool also helps educators create lesson plans and monitor student progress in real-time. A unique feature, added at a school's request, allows the system to detect when a student expresses thoughts of self-harm or harming others and alerts teachers for potential intervention. While creator Sal Khan sees immense potential for personalized learning, the article notes the technology is still evolving and raises questions about student privacy and the intrusiveness of monitoring.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Argues Teaching 'Self-Connection' is the Most Crucial Skill for a Child's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships asserts that the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection," the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, authentic confidence, and protects mental health. It suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, undermining this connection. The author provides practical advice for parents, such as validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self without judgment, and modeling their own emotional awareness to build a strong internal foundation in their children.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to serve as a single, empowered point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to address issues such as leaks, incorrect billing, and other disputes. The move is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public scrutiny over rising bills and a record number of sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030, signaling significant reforms to come for the industry and its regulator, Ofwat.</p>

Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the vibrant artwork features Valenzuela in his famous wind-up pose and tipping his cap, symbolizing unity within the Latino community.
