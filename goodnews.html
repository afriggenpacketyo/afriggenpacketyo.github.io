          <p>China is progressing with its advanced nuclear energy program, having completed the conceptual design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. This fourth-generation reactor, expected to be operational after 2030, aims to provide a more fuel-efficient power source. The development places China alongside other major powers like Russia and the U.S. in the race to innovate advanced nuclear technologies for future energy needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are pioneering a new method for hurricane forecasting by equipping sharks with sensors to gather critical ocean data. Three sharks are currently collecting information on water temperature and conductivity in the Atlantic, providing insights that are difficult to obtain via satellites or slow, expensive robotic gliders. This innovative approach aims to leverage the natural behavior of sharks to create a network of living ocean sensors, potentially enhancing the accuracy of hurricane models and better predicting storm intensity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Key performances came from Teoscar Hernández, who delivered a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who contributed with a double and a sacrifice fly. This victory marks the team's third in four games and suggests a positive turn for their lineup ahead of the upcoming trade deadline. The bullpen also delivered a strong performance, recording its first scoreless effort in several weeks.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier talent, including PhD candidates from the U.S. who face funding cuts and stricter visa policies. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract scientists and engineers needed to leverage artificial intelligence and expand their operations. This brain drain from the U.S. is fueling the rapid growth of China's quant sector, now the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a significant recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially shift the balance of power, giving President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a majority in parliament. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups following controversial parliamentary reforms pushed by the KMT, which critics accuse of obstructing the government's agenda and being overly aligned with China's interests.</p>

The California Public Utilities Commission clarified that Tesla's current permit only allows for a charter-party service with non-autonomous vehicles. This regulatory stance presents a significant hurdle for Tesla's ambitions to launch a fully driverless service in the Bay Area, similar to the limited, supervised version currently being tested in Austin, Texas.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was a direct consequence of the players skipping the MLS All-Star game, a penalty mandated by a long-standing league policy. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and argued that the league doesn't understand the players' need for rest, especially with a demanding game schedule. The MLS commissioner defended the decision but acknowledged the policy may need reevaluation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm weather led to an abundance of aphids, a key food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings for many butterfly species. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, as wetland habitats crucial for laying eggs are drying up.</p>

          <p>A BBC article investigates the rigidity of popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a day. Experts suggest that while these targets are useful, there is often room for flexibility and individual variation. For instance, thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most people, and while 7-9 hours of sleep is crucial, consistency is key. The consensus is that incorporating a generally healthy outlook is more beneficial than stressing over hitting exact numerical targets every single day.</p>
