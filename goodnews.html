          <p>Quebec's universal childcare program, providing care for less than $7 a day, offers valuable insights for the US, which faces a growing childcare crisis. Enacted in 1997, the program gives equal opportunities to children, gets mothers back to work, and increases government tax revenue. The model, inspired by US research, has been a win for all involved, offering high-quality early education, unionized jobs for childcare workers, and financial benefits to the government. The success of Quebec's program has influenced the development of a universal childcare system across Canada. Despite challenges, the Quebec model demonstrates the potential for affordable, high-quality childcare through public investment.</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from the late 2000s, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic for its unique representation and message. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to curb the use of the word "gay" as an insult. Duff's ad, along with others, gained traction on TV and social media, leading to a decrease in the use of the term and bullying rates. The ad's impact is still felt today, with references in media and recreations on platforms like TikTok. While representation has improved, advocates note the need for further efforts, particularly for transgender people.</p>

          <p>Purchasing a $400,000 annuity at age 70 can provide a guaranteed monthly income, but the exact amount varies based on several factors. These factors include gender, with women receiving slightly lower payouts due to longer life expectancy, and whether the annuity is single life or joint life. The current interest rate environment also significantly impacts payouts, with higher rates translating into stronger payouts for new annuities. Different types of annuities, such as fixed, inflation-adjusted, and variable, offer varying levels of risk and income potential. Optional riders and guarantees can further affect the monthly payout.
