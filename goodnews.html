        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas in its challenge to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a plan to store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Kavanaugh stated that Texas did not have standing to sue since it wasn't a party in the licensing proceeding. The ruling reverses a lower court decision but does not address the commission's authority to license private companies for offsite nuclear waste storage. The case highlights the ongoing political challenges of nuclear waste disposal, with spent fuel remaining radioactive for thousands of years, and the decision does not indicate whether the commission is right or wrong on the merits of the case, only that the state of Texas could not sue.</p>

          <p>The Senate version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a temporary enhanced tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and up, offering up to $6,000 per qualifying individual. This "senior bonus" is in lieu of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits and would be available to individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes up to $150,000. The deduction phases out at a rate of 6% for incomes above these thresholds and would be in place for tax years 2025 through 2028. Both chambers must agree on the bill before it is sent to the president to sign, with a version of the senior deduction expected to be included. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Purchasing a $500,000 annuity at age 65 can provide a significant and reliable income stream during retirement. Monthly payouts vary based on factors such as gender, payout structure (single or joint life), and prevailing interest rates. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old male could receive around $3,269 per month, while a female of the same age might receive approximately $3,151 per month. The type of annuity, payout features, and inflation protection also influence the monthly income, so it is important to compare quotes from multiple insurance companies before making a decision.
