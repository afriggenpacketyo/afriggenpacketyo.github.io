          <p>Whirlpool, a major American appliance manufacturer, supports President Trump's proposed tariffs, believing they will provide a competitive advantage against foreign rivals like LG and Samsung. The company, which produces 80% of its products in the U.S., asserts that foreign competitors currently undercut prices due to cheaper imported steel. Whirlpool anticipates that a 50% tariff on imported steel and aluminum will level the playing field, potentially increasing demand for domestically made appliances. The article highlights how tariffs could revitalize American industry and lead to increased hiring, while also acknowledging the potential for higher consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goals in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, demonstrating an average weight loss of 10.5%. This positions the drug as a potential needle-free alternative in the lucrative GLP-1 market, offering greater convenience and potentially broader access than existing injections. While some side effects like gastrointestinal issues were noted, experts are optimistic about its potential to expand obesity treatment options and improve patient autonomy.

          <p>This article compares three primary methods for managing and eliminating credit card debt: balance transfer credit cards, personal loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Each option offers distinct mechanics, costs, and risks for consolidating debt and potentially lowering interest payments. Balance transfers provide promotional 0% interest but incur fees and are temporary, while personal loans offer fixed payments but higher rates. HELOCs provide low rates secured by home equity, carrying the risk of foreclosure. The article advises readers to consider credit score, debt amount, and repayment timeline to choose the best fit.

          <h2>Mortgage Interest Rate Forecast for Fall 2025 Suggests Potential Downward Trend</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently around 6.58% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are a key concern for homebuyers. Experts anticipate a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, though its immediate impact on mortgage rates may be negligible as they closely follow the bond market. However, forecasts suggest rates could trend downward to around 6% by the end of 2025. While lower rates could benefit borrowers with reduced monthly payments, they might also trigger a surge in buyer demand, potentially driving up home prices. The article provides a nuanced outlook for the fall housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many investors are unaware they can qualify for a 0% capital gains tax rate on assets held for over a year, depending on their taxable income. President Trump's "big beautiful bill" did not alter these rates but introduced new deductions for 2025, including a temporary $6,000 tax break for older Americans. These deductions could significantly reduce taxable income, expanding eligibility for the 0% bracket and offering a "golden opportunity" for some to sell assets without a tax bill. The article explains how these tax law changes could benefit certain investors, particularly older Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against 15 Maryland federal judges, which challenged a standing order preventing immediate removal of migrants disputing their detentions. The judge ruled the administration lacked legal standing and the judges were immune, stating the executive branch must find proper channels to raise such concerns, not sue a co-equal branch. The decision criticized the administration's "concerted effort to smear and impugn individual judges" who ruled against its agenda. This article highlights a significant legal victory for judicial independence against executive overreach in immigration matters.</p>
