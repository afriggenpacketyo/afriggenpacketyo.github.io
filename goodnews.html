          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe are experiencing a strong recovery in 2025, with registrations up 20% compared to the previous year, driven by corporate sales and new EU emissions mandates. However, the transition is uneven across countries, with consumer skepticism and charging infrastructure limitations still posing challenges. Tesla's sales have declined amid controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk, while Chinese automakers are gaining market share through aggressive marketing and competitive pricing. While emissions targets have been eased, experts caution that this may slow the EV transition's momentum.</p>

          <h2>Homeowners Save on Insurance by Upgrading Against Disasters</h2>

          <p>Homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses to be more resistant to disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires, as climate change shapes where and how we live. States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's, to encourage homeowners to invest in protective measures. These upgrades, like fortified roofs, can lead to significant discounts, addressing the growing insurance crisis. However, some experts say discounts need to be more substantial and insurance companies need to account for home improvements when deciding whether to offer coverage.</p>

          <h2>Seattle Balances Tree Preservation and Housing Density</h2>

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing with the preservation of trees, which are essential for mitigating climate change impacts. A new state law requires increased housing density, but not necessarily more trees. One solution involves innovative developments like Bryant Heights, which integrates housing units around existing mature trees. However, recent data indicates that Seattle's urban canopy has shrunk, prompting the city to increase tree planting and replacement efforts. The city aims to reach 30% canopy coverage by 2037, but faces challenges from development pressures.</p>

          <p>A house-burning demonstration in Anaheim showcased the effectiveness of wildfire defense strategies, offering lessons for communities rebuilding after devastating fires. Two tiny houses were pitted against a fire, one built to typical standards and the other with fire-mitigation techniques. The unprotected home was quickly engulfed in flames, while the wildfire-prepared home remained unscathed. The demonstration emphasized the importance of defensible space, fire-resistant materials, and enclosed eaves in protecting homes from wildfires.</p>
