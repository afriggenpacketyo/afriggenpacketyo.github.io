          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down a lucrative offer from Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal. The offer would have more than doubled his current salary, but Fernandes decided to remain with Manchester United after discussing the matter with his family. United is reportedly pleased with the decision, especially after head coach Ruben Amorim expressed confidence in Fernandes staying at Old Trafford. Al-Hilal was prepared to offer a substantial sum for the 30-year-old midfielder, who has made 290 appearances for United since joining in 2020.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that adding work requirements to Medicaid is not a bad idea, citing past successes with similar rules in welfare and other benefit programs. The author, drawing from decades of experience in job training, asserts that work requirements can provide a necessary push and support network for individuals to enter the job market. While acknowledging the challenges faced by some participants, the author emphasizes the potential for increased employment, confidence, and structure in their lives. The proposed Medicaid work rules exclude those with disabilities, mental health conditions, and adults with young children.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that many market participants view continued reductions in government bond purchases as appropriate, signaling a move towards policy normalization. Ueda noted limited calls to revise the current reduction plan through March 2026 during a mid-May meeting with market participants. The BOJ plans to discuss the purchase reduction at its next policy meeting, aiming to gradually shrink its balance sheet. Ueda also mentioned the BOJ's cautious stance on raising policy rates due to uncertainties from U.S. tariffs.</p>

The council had refused her application for a wild animal license, raising concerns about her care of animals, but a judge ruled in her favor, citing her passion for animal welfare. The judge criticized the council's contradictory views and ordered them to pay Marsh ¬£19,641 in costs. Marsh expressed relief and gratitude, hoping the ruling would silence her critics.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation fell to a cooler-than-expected 1.9% in May, dropping below the European Central Bank's 2% target. The decline was driven by sharp decreases in services inflation, according to flash data from Eurostat. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, tobacco, and alcohol prices, also eased. The latest figures will be considered by the ECB as it prepares for its next interest rate decision, with markets pricing in a high probability of a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

The divers, who believed the line was illegal, were charged after it was revealed the fisherman was licensed for shark research. The pardons erase the felony convictions, restoring their voting rights, firearm ownership, and freedom to travel. Attorneys for the divers expressed relief, stating that the case should never have been filed.</p>
