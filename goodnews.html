          <h2>Study Suggests Weight-Loss Medications May Reduce Alcohol Consumption</h2>

          <p>A new study indicates that GLP-1 medications, commonly used for weight loss and diabetes, may also help heavy drinkers reduce their alcohol consumption by nearly 70%. The study, involving 262 adults prescribed these medications, found that heavy drinkers experienced the most significant decrease in alcohol intake, with no participants reporting increased consumption. Researchers believe these drugs may affect brain chemicals tied to pleasure and fullness, providing individuals with greater control over their cravings. The article notes that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanism.</p>

The council is providing priority support to students preparing for exams and has assured that those currently sitting exams will receive the necessary assistance.</p>
