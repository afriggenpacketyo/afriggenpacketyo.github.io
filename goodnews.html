          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after siding with the ACLU's argument that his detention was based on protected First Amendment speech supporting Palestine. The judge concluded that Suri, who had lawful status, was not a flight risk or a danger to the community, admonishing the government for failing to provide evidence against the claim that Suri was being retaliated against for his speech. The Department of Homeland Security had alleged Suri was spreading Hamas propaganda and had connections to a known terrorist, but the judge prohibited the government from redetaining him without notice.</p>

          <p>ESPN's Karl Ravech speculates that MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list may be connected to a recent meeting between Manfred and President Donald Trump.

Ravech acknowledges Rose's accomplishments but notes that Rose's gambling violations should be taken into consideration when determining if he should be in the Hall of Fame.

          <p>The Baltimore Ravens have signed star running back Derrick Henry to a two-year contract extension worth $30 million, setting a record for a running back over 30 years old. The deal includes $25 million guaranteed, ensuring Henry's continued presence with the team. Henry, the NFL's active leading rusher, played a crucial role in the Ravens' offense last season. His performance freed up space for quarterback Lamar Jackson, contributing to the team's overall success.</p>
