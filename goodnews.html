          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor, urging its board to implement significant changes to address chronic underperformance. In a public letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio, and refreshing the board. The firm highlighted Avantor's 50-60% share price decline over recent years and a previously rejected acquisition offer that was well above the current stock value. Engine suggests these reforms could substantially increase shareholder value, or alternatively, the company should consider a sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm over the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. While not currently projected to make landfall in the continental United States, it is bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to nearby Caribbean islands like St. Martin and St. Barts, prompting flood and landslide warnings. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm will continue to strengthen before taking a sharp turn northeast, potentially passing between the U.S. and Bermuda. As a precaution, FEMA has deployed personnel to Puerto Rico and several seaports have been closed.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. Analysts note that Samsung's wider range of products at various price points also contributes to its success. Apple is expected to respond with its own new designs, including a slimmer iPhone and potentially a foldable model by 2026, intensifying the competition.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated response to the recent summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European leaders have issued a joint statement reaffirming their steadfast support for Ukraine. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Finland, along with EU officials, insisted that Russia cannot have a veto over Ukraine's future membership in NATO or the EU. The statement emphasized that pressure on Russia's war economy will continue through sanctions until a just and lasting peace is achieved. This unified European stance aims to manage the diplomatic fallout from the bilateral U.S.-Russia talks, from which they were excluded.</p>

Chambers began her Parkrun journey in 2016 at the age of 88 and has since become a beloved local legend, inspiring fellow runners and even running alongside Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes. Despite her age and recent health challenges, including a broken leg during the pandemic, her determination and positive spirit have made her a celebrated figure in the community running event.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first archaeological excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, a decorative gold finial about 1.5 inches long, was found near the route of a major Roman road. Experts believe it is a high-status item, as gold was used only by the elite during that period, and it may have been part of a pair with a similar object found nearby in 2021. The discovery provides new insight into the use of the ancient thoroughfare long after the Roman Empire's decline.</p>

          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with homicide numbers falling to their lowest levels in half a century. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying the small number of individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence. Instead of zero-tolerance policing, the city's approach combines targeted outreach offering social services, job training, and housing with the credible threat of strict law enforcement for those who refuse help. This multi-agency effort, championed by Mayor Brandon Scott, represents a significant turnaround for a city long plagued by high rates of violence.</p>

          <h2>Americans Believe Age 27 is Ideal to Start Retirement Savings, But Experts Advise Earlier</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a recent survey, Americans on average believe the ideal age to begin saving for retirement is 27, with a target retirement age of 58. However, certified financial planners emphasize that starting even earlier can be significantly more beneficial due to the power of compound interest. Data shows younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are already starting to save earlier than their predecessors, at average ages of 20 and 25, respectively. Experts stress that an early start allows savings to grow exponentially over time, making it easier to build a substantial nest egg for a comfortable retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

The six-day event draws around 30,000 musicians and fans, who gather to compete, jam, and keep the rich traditions of mountain music alive. The festival is a vital hub for passing these musical styles, which blend European, African, and Native American influences, to younger generations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that young chimpanzees primarily learn their complex communication styles, which combine vocalizations with gestures, from their mothers and maternal relatives. By observing a wild chimpanzee community in Uganda, scientists found that related individuals on the mother's side shared similar patterns of vocal-visual combinations, a resemblance not found with their fathers. Since young chimps spend their formative years with their mothers, this indicates the behavior is socially learned rather than purely genetic. The findings suggest that this capacity for social learning in communication is an ancient trait shared with humans, dating back to our last common ancestor.</p>

          <p>A female black bear, known for an epic 100-mile journey across Southern California in 2024, has been spotted with three cubs in the Santa Monica Mountains. This marks the first time in years that a bear family has been documented residing in the area. The bear, tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, previously gained attention for her extensive travels through multiple national forests and across major freeways. Her decision to den and raise her cubs in the region has surprised biologists and raised questions among local residents, who are unaccustomed to having ursine neighbors.</p>

          <p>California has approved a first-of-its-kind conservation plan aimed at protecting the western Joshua tree from the long-term threats of climate change and development. The plan identifies crucial habitats where the iconic species might survive in a warmer future and outlines strategies like limiting development and reducing wildfire risk. The law requires permits and fees for removing or damaging the trees, a controversial measure for some local residents and officials in desert communities who fear it will stifle growth. Proponents hail the plan as a groundbreaking, forward-looking effort to conserve a species that is currently abundant but faces future peril.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration cuts federal funding for youth mental health services in schools, a Los Angeles-based hotline called Teen Line is providing crucial peer-to-peer support. The service, run by trained teenage volunteers, fields thousands of calls, texts, and emails annually from young people struggling with issues like loneliness, relationships, and suicidal thoughts. The program offers a unique space where teens can be heard by peers who understand their contemporary challenges, from social media pressure to school lockdown drills. It serves as a vital first step for youth in crisis, filling a widening gap in accessible mental healthcare resources.</p>
