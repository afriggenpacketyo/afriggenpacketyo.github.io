          <p>Russell Martin has been appointed as the new head coach of Rangers, signing a three-year contract as part of a fresh era for the club. Martin, formerly of Southampton and Swansea City, expressed that he "won't make any promises" but emphasized the importance of securing early wins while fostering player development. A US-based consortium, including the investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers, recently completed a takeover of the club, marking a significant shift in ownership. Martin stated that winning is how you convince people - players, staff and supporters.</p>

          <p>Despite a thriving AI startup scene, India has yet to produce its own leading AI engine comparable to ChatGPT or DeepSeek. The Indian government has launched the IndiaAI Mission with significant funding to develop indigenous Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to critical sectors. Experts emphasize the need for collaboration between government, industry, and academia to build a comprehensive AI value chain. Challenges include hardware shortages, limited funding compared to the US and China, and the complexity of addressing India's diverse languages.</p>

          <p>Louisiana has passed a new law criminalizing attempts to gain a child's trust with the intent to sexually abuse them, championed by a survivor of Catholic clergy molestation, his wife, and her father, a state lawmaker. The law targets offenders at least four years older than the victim and applies even if no abuse has occurred. This makes it illegal to pursue ‚Äúan intimate relationship with a child under the age of 17 by means of seduction, emotional manipulation, threats, promises, coercion, enticement, isolation or extortion with the specific intent to commit a sex offense ‚Ä¶ against the minor‚Äù. Tim and Sarah Gioe, inspired by their experience with clergy abuse, pushed for the legislation after learning that existing laws were insufficient to prosecute grooming behavior.</p>
