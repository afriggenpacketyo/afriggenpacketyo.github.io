          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi over a lawsuit regarding the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement resolves claims that the companies failed to update labels despite knowing about a diminished response in about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians. While the companies did not admit wrongdoing, they agreed to the settlement, which will be divided equally between them and paid to the state by June 9. Governor Josh Green hailed the settlement as a major victory for Hawaii.</p>

          <p>A judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at 20 federal agencies, following a lawsuit from federal employee unions. The ruling prevents the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and other agencies from taking further steps to carry out an executive order mandating large-scale job cuts. Judge Susan Illston stated that the administration likely exceeded its legal authority and needs congressional approval for the changes. The order remains in effect for at least 14 days while the case is considered.</p>

          <p>Police in Bristol are focusing on disrupting and criminalizing those who buy sexual services, rather than the sex workers themselves. Dedicated teams engage with street sex workers while targeting kerb crawlers, aiming to combat night-time exploitation and harm. Op Boss, running for 15 years, adopts the Nordic Model, safeguarding women and disrupting men seeking to purchase sex. In an 18-month period, the team dealt with 145 offences, sending over 1,000 men on courses to prevent reoffending and educate them about the vulnerabilities of sex workers.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17 (SB17) to prevent hostile foreign powers, like China, Iran, and Russia, from acquiring land in the state. The bill prohibits entities affiliated with governments deemed national security threats from purchasing real estate that poses risks to public health or safety. The state's attorney general is empowered to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals. The law includes exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and personal homesteads. The bill aims to protect Texans from foreign espionage and influence, with supporters emphasizing it's not a partisan issue.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives, such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate, and lower labor costs. In 2024, 65% of UK production spend came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to ¬£1.37bn. Films like Barbie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and The Batman have utilized UK locations and studios. US President Trump's proposal to impose tariffs on movies made in foreign countries has raised concerns in the industry.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intent to land on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been drifting in space for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the landing location is unknown. The spacecraft's protective heat shield increases the likelihood that it will survive the plunge, though the risk of injuries on the ground is low. The spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, covering a vast area of the Earth.</p>
