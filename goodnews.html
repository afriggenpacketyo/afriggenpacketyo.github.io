          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly raising $10 billion in a new funding round that values the company at an immense $200 billion. This development highlights the escalating valuations within the AI industry, following similar large-scale fundraising by competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. The new capital is expected to finance the construction of massive data centers and the acquisition of millions of AI chips needed for developing next-generation models. Despite its high valuation and ambitious projects, the company's Grok chatbot has faced controversy and is considered by some to be technologically behind its main rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the 85-page complaint violated federal rules requiring a "short and plain statement." The judge characterized the lawsuit as repetitive, superfluous, and an improper platform to "rage against an adversary." Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint that adheres to court standards. The New York Times has maintained that the lawsuit lacks merit and is an attempt to stifle independent reporting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since late 2024, mortgage rates have fallen, providing significant savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For a $750,000 mortgage, the average 30-year fixed rate has dropped to around 6.13%, reducing monthly payments by over $450 compared to rates at the beginning of the year. This shift offers increased affordability and financial flexibility for borrowers, potentially saving homeowners over $160,000 in interest over the life of the loan. The central bank's move was prompted by concerns over a weakening labor market, signaling a potential for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari Supports Two Additional Rate Cuts, Citing Limited Inflation Impact from Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 13:45:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has advocated for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one recently approved by the central bank. He argued that the inflationary effects of President Trump's tariffs are likely a "one-time effect" that will play out over several years, rather than a persistent pressure. This view, combined with a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, gives the Fed room for more accommodative monetary policy. Although Kashkari is not a voting member of the FOMC this year, his comments provide insight into the more dovish perspective within the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Irish governments have unveiled a new inter-governmental deal aimed at addressing the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The framework seeks to replace the UK's controversial Legacy Act, which was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties for including a conditional amnesty. Key features of the new deal include the restoration of inquests, reforms to the legacy investigation commission, and the establishment of a cross-border body for information retrieval. Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris called it the "best, and last, opportunity" to provide truth and justice for victims and their families.</p>

These new works explore the debate between AI "accelerationists" and "doomers," and examine AI's immediate impacts on society, from medicine to politics. Some of the most notable books in this emerging microgenre are fictional or memoir-style explorations of personal relationships with AI.

He also suggested that Trump's immigration policies could have a disinflationary effect by easing pressure on shelter prices.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has indicated that the Labour government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, stating the policy change is "on the table." The cap, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child. This issue has become a central point in the party's deputy leadership contest, with Phillipson positioning herself as a champion against child poverty. Proponents of scrapping the policy, such as the Resolution Foundation, estimate that doing so would cost £3.5 billion but could lift nearly half a million children out of poverty.</p>
