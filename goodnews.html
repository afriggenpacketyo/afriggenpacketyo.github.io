          <h2>UK Economy Shows Encouraging Growth Despite Lingering Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 07:22:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy is showing signs of recovery with a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing forecasts, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This growth was driven by increased consumer spending and business investment, marking a positive shift after a period of economic challenges. However, concerns remain about the impact of US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes, which could potentially slow down future growth. Businesses are approaching future plans cautiously due to these economic uncertainties, although some are confident about absorbing the tariffs to maintain stable prices. Optimism has been tempered by market views on interest rate cuts, which may affect mortgage pricing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but warned that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could lead to higher prices for consumers. Despite maintaining its full-year financial forecast, Walmart executives expressed concerns about the magnitude of the tariffs and their potential impact on narrow retail margins. While Walmart is more insulated from tariff-induced cost increases than many competitors due to its large grocery business, the company acknowledges that it is not entirely immune. Consumer sentiment has been declining due to concerns about tariff-related price increases and the job market.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers will likely start seeing higher prices towards the end of the month and increasingly in June due to tariffs, despite the recently announced reduction on imports from China. While Walmart beat earnings estimates, it fell just short of sales expectations, and the company stuck by its full-year forecast. The retailer also reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.</p>

          <p>Increasing fiber intake can be achieved through simple dietary adjustments, offering numerous health benefits such as disease prevention, weight loss, and improved digestion. Nutritionist Robin DeCicco recommends incorporating fiber-rich foods like berries, flaxseed, and vegetables into daily meals. Harvard Medical School data suggests that consuming 25 to 29 grams of fiber per day can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. Adding ground flaxseed to various dishes is a creative way to boost fiber intake, but it's important to increase fiber consumption gradually and drink plenty of water.</p>
