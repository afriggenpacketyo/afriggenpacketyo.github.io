          <p>Peter Coker Jr., a defendant in the $100 million New Jersey deli fraud case, was attacked by inmates in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition, according to his lawyer at his sentencing. Coker Jr. was found in Thailand after being indicted in the U.S. for securities fraud involving Hometown International, a deli owner, and E-Waste, a shell company. He was sentenced alongside his father, Peter Coker Sr., who received six months in jail and home confinement for his role in artificially inflating the companies' stock prices. The judge deemed the companies worthless and the scheme a sophisticated fraud that caused harm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Qatari royal family's proposal to gift President Trump a $400 million luxury Boeing 747-8 for use as Air Force One has sparked controversy, raising concerns about potential corruption and violations of the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act and the Constitution's emoluments clauses. While presidents often exchange gifts with foreign governments, the sheer value of this gift raises questions about Qatar's motives and the expectation of a quid pro quo. Critics argue that accepting such an extravagant gift could lead to conflicts of interest and undue influence over the president's decision-making, especially given Trump's existing business ties to Qatar. The legality of transferring the plane to Trump's presidential library is also under scrutiny, potentially leading to legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, which would be the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior groups. This adjustment, which helps beneficiaries cope with inflation, is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year. The CPI-W, used to calculate Social Security's COLA, increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months. The actual COLA may change depending on the pace of inflation in the coming months, but a lower adjustment could impact retirees, disabled individuals, and their families.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of large tariffs on goods from every country, inflation slowed in April, leading to questions about the immediate impact of these trade policies. The primary explanation for this is that US companies stocked up on foreign goods earlier in the year in anticipation of the tariffs, allowing them to keep prices low temporarily. However, as companies exhaust their pre-trade war inventories, consumer prices are expected to rise, with some companies already announcing price increases. While the risk of a severe economic crisis has fallen due to Trump's deal with China, the long-term effects of the tariffs on prices and economic growth remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a "bedrock of security and prosperity" during a visit to Saudi Arabia, where a $600 billion investment deal was announced.

Trump praised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and highlighted Saudi Arabia's economic development, contrasting it with what he described as failures of Western intervention. He also announced plans to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria, signaling a shift in U.S. foreign policy in the region.

The two-free-checked-bags policy is a collaboration with Bank of America and will be available to travelers with Spirit's branded credit card later in 2025.

          <p>The NHL has suspended Doug Cifu, minority owner and vice chairman of the Florida Panthers, for "unacceptable and inappropriate" social media posts made during an exchange with a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. The posts, which began with comments about the playoff series, escalated to include references to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Cifu's remarks, including a reference to Canada as the "51st state" and an antisemitic slur, prompted the suspension pending a meeting with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. Cifu apologized for his behavior, stating that it does not reflect the standards of the Florida Panthers organization.</p>
