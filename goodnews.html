          <h2>Audio Excerpts from Biden Interview Highlight Memory Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Axios released audio excerpts from Joe Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, which led Hur to describe Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The audio reveals Biden's difficulty remembering dates, including the year of his son Beau's death and when Donald Trump was first elected, with staff members correcting him. While a written transcript was previously released, the audio provides additional context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems. The report concluded that Biden willfully retained government documents but recommended against charges, a decision that drew criticism from both Biden and his allies. Optimism score is based on the fact that this article is about the political ramifications of memory rather than the potential loss of human life.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in the National Weather Service's history. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused significantly reduced visibility on major interstates, dropping visibility to near zero in some areas. The storms also prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports, though these were later lifted. Showers accompanying the dust storm led to reports of "mud rain" in some locations. Optimism score is based on weather events which may cause inconvenience but not necessarily loss of life.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the US credit rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', citing concerns over the government's ability to repay its debt due to rising debt and interest costs. This marks the loss of the last perfect credit rating for the US, following similar downgrades by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings. The downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs for the US. Moody's expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year. Optimism score is based on economic turmoil but no physical harm.</p>

          <h2>Trump Budget Package Blocked in Committee by Conservative Republicans</h2>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback after conservative Republicans blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. The conservatives said the legislation does not go far enough to slash federal spending, particularly concerning work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Meanwhile, a group of Republicans from blue states threatened to withhold their support if the bill does not raise a cap on state and local taxes that can be written off on federal tax returns. Optimism score is based on political disagreement but no physical harm.</p>
