          <p>A new report indicates a split in the U.S. housing market, with home prices declining in some major metropolitan areas while rising in others. Cities in the South and West, such as Austin and Miami, are seeing price drops due to a significant increase in housing inventory and a boom in pandemic-era construction. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest are experiencing continued price growth and limited supply, making conditions challenging for buyers. This regional divergence highlights how supply and demand dynamics are creating distinctly different real estate environments across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

The company announced second-quarter revenue of $139 million, significantly surpassing the $125 million expected by analysts and representing a 55% increase year-over-year. While Hinge reported a substantial net loss, much of it was attributed to stock-based compensation expenses related to the IPO. The company also issued a strong revenue forecast for the third quarter and the full year, signaling confidence in its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Yreka, a small city in Northern California, were temporarily ordered to shelter in place on Tuesday morning after an industrial accident at a local cement plant released a large dust cloud. The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office issued the alert out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazard of airborne cement particles. The order, which advised residents to turn off air conditioning and stay indoors, was lifted in less than an hour after the cloud dissipated. Officials stated that any settled particles were safe to wash away.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent remarks have intensified speculation about who will next lead the Federal Reserve, with prediction markets showing increased odds for Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke favorably of both men, referring to them as "the Kevins," while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had removed himself from consideration. The comments caused a swift reaction on prediction markets, which now give Hassett and Warsh the highest probability of being nominated to replace current Chair Jerome Powell. Both potential candidates have previously advocated for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a $10,000 deposit would earn more interest in a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. While a top high-yield savings account offers a slightly higher rate and thus marginally more earnings over three months, its rate is variable and could fall. A CD, in contrast, offers a guaranteed fixed rate, providing certainty but sacrificing liquidity. The piece concludes that with the earnings difference being negligible, savers should focus on their individual financial goals and need for access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles began their title defense in The Hundred cricket competition with a decisive six-wicket victory over London Spirit at Lord's. After choosing to bat, London Spirit collapsed, getting bowled out for just 80 runs, the second-lowest men's score in the tournament's history. Invincibles' bowler Rashid Khan was the standout performer, taking three wickets for only eleven runs, well-supported by Sam Curran's three wickets. Despite a challenging pitch, the Invincibles comfortably chased down the small target with 31 balls remaining, marking a dominant start to their season.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for homeowners thinking about borrowing $100,000 against their home's equity using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). It advises owners to ask critical questions before proceeding, such as whether looming interest rate cuts are guaranteed and how those cuts would actually impact their monthly payments. Given the variability of HELOC rates, the piece also suggests that borrowers should carefully consider if a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a more stable and suitable alternative. The central message is to approach borrowing against home equity judiciously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa has reached an agreement to sign striker Evann Guessand from French club Nice in a deal worth approximately £30 million. The 24-year-old Ivory Coast international is expected to undergo a medical exam before finalizing the transfer. Guessand was a key player for Nice last season, scoring 12 goals and being named their player of the season. The signing addresses Villa's need for another senior center-forward after the departure of Jhon Duran, leaving Ollie Watkins as the only other primary striker on the team's roster.</p>
