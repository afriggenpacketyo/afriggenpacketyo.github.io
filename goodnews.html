Pitcher Michael Barnett limited the damage over six innings, and freshman Easton Hawk closed the game to earn the save.

          <p>European startup founders and VCs are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. The debate was sparked by some investors who believe Europe needs to embrace overwork to compete globally. However, many argue that this culture is unsustainable and goes against European values and regulations. Instead, they emphasize the need for more funding, resources, and a focus on innovation and work-life balance to foster a stronger startup ecosystem.</p>
