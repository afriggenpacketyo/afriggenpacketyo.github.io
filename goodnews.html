          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has publicly shared her experience of losing 31 pounds with the assistance of a GLP-1 medication. The 23-time Grand Slam champion explained that after the birth of her second child, she struggled with health issues related to her weight, including joint pain, despite her active lifestyle as a professional athlete. Williams stated her decision to use the medication was for her overall health and to reach a weight where she felt comfortable, not due to external pressure. By speaking openly, she aims to destigmatize the use of such medications for health-related weight management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in the civil business fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million, was an "excessive fine" and therefore violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment. However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also upheld by the appellate court.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:22:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed admitting to doing so. The primary motivations cited are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes, as kids' meals are typically less expensive than standard adult entrees. This consumer behavior shift comes as the restaurant industry faces economic pressures, with some major chains reporting slower sales. The findings from Lightspeed Commerce suggest that for many adult diners, the lower prices and simpler options on kids' menus are becoming a practical and appealing choice when eating out.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:21:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, is creating a significant labor shortage in skilled trades. These facilities require constant support from technicians, HVAC specialists, and electricians, but are competing with other industries for a shrinking pool of qualified blue-collar workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, around 400,000 skilled trade jobs are currently unfilled in the U.S., a number projected to grow substantially. Industry experts highlight the need for new technology to improve efficiency and aggressive recruitment into apprenticeship programs that offer high wages without college debt.</p>

          <h2>New Pharmaceutical Plant Highlights Challenges of Onshoring Drug Manufacturing Amid Tariff Threats</h2>

          <p>Fujifilm's new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina exemplifies the significant time and investment required for pharmaceutical companies to increase U.S.-based production. The facility, five years in the making, is opening just as the Trump administration threatens tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing, but its long development timeline shows that shifting complex supply chains is a slow process. While drugmakers like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are investing heavily in U.S. facilities, experts note it can take three to five years to get a new plant operational, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new trade policies.</p>

          <p>Chipotle is launching a pilot program for autonomous drone food delivery in the Dallas area through a partnership with Zipline. Select customers will be able to order from the full menu via the Zipline app, with an autonomous aircraft delivering the food from a single restaurant location in Rowlett, Texas. The drones will hover at 300 feet while a small robotic Zip lowers the order to the customer's location. This initiative, dubbed "Zipotle," is part of the restaurant's strategy to innovate its delivery options and appeal to its key younger consumer base, with potential for future expansion based on the test's results.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has returned to practice this week after being sidelined with a back injury but is maintaining a cautious, "day-to-day approach" to his recovery. The 37-year-old veteran, who has been practicing for four consecutive days, declined to provide specifics about the injury or set a timeline for his return, including whether he will be ready for the season opener. Coach Sean McVay described the injury as an aggravated disc but noted that Stafford has looked progressively better in practice.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is upgrading its aging fleet with the introduction of 280 new patrol vehicles. Sheriff Robert Luna announced the rollout, which aims to phase out older cars, many of which are over eight years old with more than 100,000 miles. The new vehicles, including 48 hybrids, are intended to enhance deputy and public safety, improve operational efficiency, and reduce maintenance costs and environmental impact. The modern fleet comes equipped with advanced safety features such as collision avoidance systems, enhanced visibility lighting, and low-frequency sirens for faster and safer emergency responses.</p>

          <p>Sales of existing homes in the U.S. saw a 2% increase in July compared to June, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. This modest rise is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020 and helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price was $422,400, up only 0.2% from a year ago, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>
