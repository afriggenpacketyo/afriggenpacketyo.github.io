          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital has commented on OpenAI's recent partnership announcements with chipmakers AMD and Nvidia, emphasizing that these are currently just deals, not full-scale deployments. He stated that performance will be the ultimate determinant, noting that "the best chips will win." The move is seen as evidence of an intensifying AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and Chinese firms like DeepSeek, and highlights a global scarcity of computing power. OpenAI's partnerships are aimed at increasing production to build more complex AI models and meet the surging demand for AI services across the entire ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international criminal network suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China in the past year. The year-long investigation, dubbed Operation Echosteep, was triggered after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. This led to the discovery of a shipment of nearly 900 phones and the eventual arrest of 18 suspects, including two alleged ringleaders. Police believe the gang was responsible for exporting nearly 40% of all phones stolen in London, where thieves were paid up to £300 per device.</p>

          <p>Following a student walkout at Brooklin High School, the Durham District School Board has requested that three of its schools "pause" their decision to cancel prom this year. The principals of Brooklin, Brock, and Uxbridge secondary schools had jointly announced the cancellation, citing growing liabilities, risks, and expectations associated with the event. In response, over 100 students protested, arguing that the tradition is a rite of passage, especially since their Grade 8 graduation was impacted by the pandemic. The school board has now urged the schools to consult with students and staff to explore alternatives or adjustments.</p>

In a BBC Radio 2 interview, Swift stated that her fiancé loves her passion for making music and that their shared dedication to performing for large audiences connects them.

This integration is part of OpenAI's new Apps SDK, which allows third-party applications to plug into its popular AI model. The announcement highlights Figma's increasing focus on incorporating generative AI tools and provides a significant boost in visibility for the company, given ChatGPT's massive user base.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates and more reductions anticipated, savers are weighing the benefits of certificates of deposit (CDs) versus high-yield savings accounts. A comparison shows that for a $10,000 deposit, earnings over various short-term periods are currently quite similar between the two account types. However, the fixed rate of a CD offers guaranteed returns, whereas the variable rate on a high-yield savings account is likely to decrease with future Fed cuts. The article suggests a strategy of using both to balance guaranteed earnings with liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is becoming a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $150,000 HELOC, current monthly payments would be approximately $1,811 for a 10-year repayment period and $1,424 for a 15-year period, which is notably cheaper than a year ago. Because HELOCs have variable rates, future rate cuts are expected to lower these costs further, making them an attractive tool for tapping into home equity. The article advises that the risk depends on the borrower's financial stability and equity levels. (not investment advice)</p>
