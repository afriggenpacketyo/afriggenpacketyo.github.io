          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to criticism from the White House regarding cost overruns in the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In a letter, Powell addressed accusations of luxury amenities and directed critics to a new public website providing transparency on the project. The inquiry is part of a broader White House pressure campaign against the Fed for not lowering interest rates, with administration officials accusing Powell of mismanagement. Powell's reply maintained a professional tone, explaining the reasons for the budget issues without engaging in the confrontational rhetoric from the White House.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim to a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. Exxon, which holds the largest stake in the project, stated it disagrees with the ruling but respects the process. The acquisition is a major strategic victory for Chevron, though it may lead to some headcount reductions as the two companies integrate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will not take further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their pro-Palestinian comments at the Glastonbury festival. The force concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The investigation, which the band labeled "political policing intimidation," was part of a wider controversy surrounding the group's political statements. The decision to drop the case follows weeks of debate and even comments from the prime minister about the appropriateness of their performance at the festival.</p>

          <p>With silver prices reaching their highest point in over a decade, some investors may be tempted to shift their focus from the much more expensive gold market. This article explores the pros and cons of such a move, noting that while silver offers similar protections against inflation at a lower entry price, it lacks gold's historical stability and value. Instead of a complete switch, it suggests that investors might use the current market momentum as an opportunity to re-evaluate their precious metal allocations within a diversified portfolio. The optimal balance depends on individual goals and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Mexican envoy has stated that Chinese companies operating in Mexico are unlikely to be excluded from the trade benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Speaking at an expo in China, a deputy commercial counsellor suggested that the upcoming review of the trade deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting specific countries. This would mean companies might need to source more of their product components locally to qualify for preferential treatment. The comments provide reassurance to Chinese investors amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides advice on how to recognize fraudulent text messages pretending to be from banks, such as the recent phishing campaign targeting Chase customers. Scammers often create a sense of urgency, use suspicious links, and employ generic greetings to trick recipients into revealing personal account information. To protect oneself, individuals should never click on suspicious links or reply to the messages. Instead, they should contact their bank directly through official channels, report the scam, and consider using security tools like two-factor authentication and antivirus software for added protection.</p>

          <p>A new provision in a recently signed bill, popularly known as "no tax on tips," is creating confusion for workers and tax professionals. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but a deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028, and is still subject to payroll and state taxes. The Internal Revenue Service is expected to provide clarification in October on which specific occupations qualify for the break. Uncertainty also exists around how the deduction will interact with new reporting thresholds and whether underreported cash tips will be eligible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the U.S. inflation rate rising again, the Federal Reserve is expected to delay interest rate cuts, creating a strategic opportunity for savers. This article suggests that investing in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) is a sensible move, as it allows individuals to lock in currently high interest rates without committing for a long period. This flexibility is crucial in an uncertain economic climate where rates could change. By choosing a short-term CD, savers can earn significant interest while retaining the ability to adapt to future economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ focus on profitability, children's content has emerged as a crucial asset for reducing customer churn. Shows like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" are highly effective because children watch them repeatedly, driving high engagement at a lower production cost than adult programming. This longevity and re-watch value provide a stable reason for families to maintain subscriptions. The strategy also increasingly involves a presence on YouTube, which dominates viewership on TV screens and serves as a vital platform for discovery and complementary content.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition that affects blood flow in the legs. The diagnosis came after the president noticed swelling, prompting a medical evaluation. According to his physician, the condition is "benign and common" for his age group and tests showed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The physician also attributed recent bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, stating it was unrelated to the vein condition.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to sign winger Bryan Mbeumo after Brentford accepted a £65 million bid for the Cameroon international. The deal, which could rise to £70 million with add-ons, would make the 25-year-old Brentford's largest-ever sale. Mbeumo is expected to become United's third major signing of the summer, valued for his versatility, finishing ability, and high work rate. His threat on the ball was notable last season, where he led the Premier League in carries that directly resulted in a goal, making him a key addition to United's attack.</p>
