          <p>This opinion article reflects on China's 80th-anniversary commemorations of its victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression. The author argues that remembering the brutality of the wartime Japanese military is not an exercise in cultivating hatred but a necessary act of historical truth and reflection. The piece contrasts this historical remembrance with the widespread popularity of modern Japanese culture, such as anime and manga, which the author enjoyed while growing up in China. It posits that one can condemn the historical aggression and attempts to distort history while simultaneously embracing and appreciating the people and culture of contemporary Japan.</p>

          <p>A Chinese citizen, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison for illegally exporting firearms and military-related items to North Korea. The Justice Department revealed that Wen, who had overstayed his student visa, was directed by North Korean officials to procure the goods in the United States. He purchased numerous weapons in Texas and shipped them from California, disguising at least one shipment as a refrigerator. In exchange for his smuggling efforts, Wen received approximately $2 million in payments from Pyongyang, highlighting a significant breach of international sanctions against North Korea.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews in Oregon are engaged in a delicate operation to save the Doerner Fir, one of the world's tallest non-redwood trees, after it ignited last week. The 325-foot-tall, 450-year-old coastal Douglas fir was still smoldering high up in its trunk, creating a challenging situation for responders. Helicopters have been used to douse the flames from above, as falling debris makes it too dangerous for climbing crews to engage the fire directly. Firefighters have established a containment line and sprinkler system on the ground to prevent the blaze from spreading while they monitor the situation.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, for allegedly creating and operating a sophisticated network of malware-infected devices known as the "Rapper Bot" Botnet. This network was reportedly used to conduct large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which can shut down websites and servers by overwhelming them with traffic. Prosecutors allege Foltz rented out the botnet to clients who targeted victims in over 80 countries, including U.S. government and tech company networks. Law enforcement officials have since seized control of the botnet, effectively halting its attacks.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Ukraine Peace Approach Prioritizes Process Over Substantive Detail</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic summits concerning the war in Ukraine reveal a focus on the sequence of meetings over the complex details of a potential peace deal. This analysis suggests a disconnect between Trump's process-oriented approach—meeting first with Putin, then Zelensky, and planning a trilateral summit—and the European leaders' focus on substantive issues like security guarantees and cease-fire terms. While the White House meetings projected unity, Trump's vagueness on commitments and wavering on a cease-fire highlight significant challenges. This approach mirrors past diplomatic efforts, such as with North Korea, where the pageantry of summits has not led to substantive breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>In the newly reimagined US Open mixed doubles event, the star pairing of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu was defeated by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula in a straight-sets match. Despite the crowd's support for Alcaraz and Raducanu, the more experienced doubles play of Pegula, a former world No. 1 in the discipline, and the sharp performance of Draper proved decisive. The match was a highlight of the revamped tournament, which aims to attract top singles players with a new format and significant prize money, though it has drawn criticism from some doubles specialists.</p>

While the report marked the first time since 2014 that Home Depot fell short on both top and bottom lines, executives noted encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent summits with Ukrainian and Russian leaders have substantially increased the possibility of ending the war, despite formidable obstacles. The author suggests that while Russia continues its daily attacks and offers disingenuous concessions, Trump has the ability to keep the peace process viable. The article recommends that Trump amplify his commitment to Ukraine's security, use strategic ambiguity to threaten sanctions against Russia, and signal support for bipartisan military aid legislation. These actions, the author contends, could successfully navigate the complex diplomatic landscape and prevent the peace effort from stalling.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly creating a new, more powerful artificial intelligence chip, tentatively named the B30A, specifically for the Chinese market. This development follows an agreement where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China in exchange for permission to sell chips there again after a previous ban. While Nvidia confirmed it is evaluating various products, the move reflects the company's strategy to navigate complex U.S. export controls while competing in the lucrative Chinese market. The new chip is expected to be based on the company's advanced Blackwell architecture. (not investment advice)</p>
