          <h2>Debate Arises Over Chinese Solar Panels in the Global South</h2>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by providing cheap solar panels, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The think tank, Renewables First, argues that the increasing flow of Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, leading to stranded assets. Muhammad Basit Ghauri, the report's lead author, highlights this as an unintentional but profound strategic contradiction, positioning Pakistan as ground zero for energy disruption. However, a Chinese energy scholar has questioned whether this vision is too expensive to be true, implying that the costs may outweigh the benefits.</p>

          <p>A Japanese government report indicates that domestic tourism is struggling to keep pace with inbound visitors, prompting a focus on encouraging residents to explore their own country. The Japan Tourism Agency's annual white paper shifts its focus from inbound visitors to Japanese domestic travelers, whose numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. While foreign visitors have increased, domestic trips by Japanese travelers are down by 8.2 percent compared to 2019. The agency aims to promote a new style of travel that involves more engagement with local communities to encourage repeat visits and create a sense of returning home, highlighting successful demonstration projects like the one in Dake Onsen.</p>

          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable between South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project" will connect Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, spanning 14,800 kilometers. This initiative aims to provide a faster alternative for Chile, which is currently connected to the US and other continents via undersea cables. The project is expected to benefit Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, with Google investing between $300 million and $550 million, while the Chilean government will contribute $25 million.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum bypasses parliament and puts the question directly in the hands of the people, addressing obstacles faced by many residents due to clerical errors, insufficient income, and other systemic issues. The Italian state has been tightening its citizenship rules, and the current government quashed efforts to introduce a reform that would have automatically extended citizenship to foreign nationals who have completed a cycle of schooling. This vote presents a rare chance for Italians to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent and recognize the diversity of its residents.</p>

Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has hauled out more than 1,200 derelict vessels.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study found that the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was essential for the evolution of birds. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly as modern birds.</p>

The study showed that good bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life and tracked what happened to those babies for the next two years. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean.</p>
