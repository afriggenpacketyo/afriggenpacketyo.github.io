        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 25 years of negotiations, World Trade Organization members have ratified a significant deal to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies, providing a much-needed boost to the institution. This agreement represents only the second multilateral deal in the WTO's three-decade history, countering fears that global cooperation is in terminal decline. The development is seen by diplomats as a vital sign of life for the WTO, especially when coupled with China's recent commitment to no longer exploit its "developing country" status to delay trade liberalization. This move strengthens the framework for international trade governance.</p>

          <p>London-based payments platform Checkout.com is launching a share buyback program for employees, establishing a new internal valuation of $12 billion to facilitate the initiative. This figure represents a significant decrease from its peak $40 billion valuation during a 2022 funding round, reflecting a broader market correction in the tech sector. The company, which competes with giants like Stripe and Adyen, states it is on track for over 30% revenue growth this year. The move provides liquidity to staff as many tech firms are remaining private for longer periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Union officials are set to hold initial talks on a proposal to create a continent-wide anti-drone defense system, often referred to as a "drone wall." The discussions, prompted by recent Russian drone incursions into member states' airspace, will involve about 10 countries, primarily along the EU's eastern border, as well as Denmark. Ukraine, which has gained significant experience in countering Russian drones, will also participate in the talks. The proposal gained momentum after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advocated for the measure to bolster regional security.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins at Bethpage Black, analysis suggests several key factors will determine whether Team Europe can secure a rare away victory against the United States. A strong start in the opening foursomes sessions will be crucial, as the home side has dominated these formats in recent years, setting the tone for the entire event. Managing the notoriously boisterous New York crowd and leveraging Europe's greater collective Ryder Cup experience are also seen as vital. The presence of U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to further electrify the atmosphere on the opening day.</p>

          <p>British Petroleum's (BP) stock has surged over 32% since April, outperforming rivals and significantly reducing the intense takeover speculation that surrounded the company earlier this year. The improved market sentiment is attributed to a strategic reset, a new leadership team, and recent successful oil discoveries. This contrasts with the situation just months ago when major competitors like Shell and Exxon Mobil were rumored as potential suitors. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is now focused on its growth strategy to drive shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart has stated it is pleased to see a crash in the secondary market prices for its viral Labubu monster toys, which had seen markups of over 2,000%. The company claims the speculative bubble was unhealthy for its brand and alienated genuine fans, and it has ramped up production tenfold to meet demand and make the products more accessible. Analysts note that while the resale hype boosted the toy's popularity, the price correction is a necessary pivot to a more sustainable business model for the mass-produced collectibles.

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-20 in a dramatic Thursday night game, thanks to a 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated he is prepared to step down after the war with Russia concludes and is open to holding elections during a potential ceasefire. In a recent interview, he affirmed that his primary goal is to end the conflict, not to secure another term in office. Ukraine has been under martial law since the 2022 invasion, which prohibits elections from being held. Zelenskyy's original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, but his leadership has continued due to the ongoing state of war.</p>
