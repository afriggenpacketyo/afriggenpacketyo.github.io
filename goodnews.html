          <p>Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who gained prominence after 9/11, has died at the age of 69 after a private battle with illness. Kerik coordinated emergency response efforts after the World Trade Center collapse and was recognized with over 100 awards for his service. However, he later pleaded guilty to eight felonies in 2009, including tax fraud and lying to the White House, serving nearly three years in prison. He was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020 and became a vocal critic of the criminal justice system, also working with Giuliani to investigate election fraud claims after the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Cambridge Associates anticipates a potential surge in global investment inflows to Chinese stocks as investors reassess their portfolios due to geopolitical tensions. The firm suggests that undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China could "provide defence" in this environment, particularly compared to expensive U.S. stocks. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, and compelling valuations along with falling interest rates make diversifying away from U.S. equities more attractive. The sentiment follows an agreement between Washington and Beijing to reduce most tariffs, easing some geopolitical risk.</p>
