          <p>Novo Nordisk's blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy, has received accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. This significant approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class treatment authorized for MASH, broadening its therapeutic applications beyond diabetes and obesity. The decision was based on the ESSENCE trial, where the drug demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis for nearly two-thirds of treated individuals. This development, coupled with a separate announcement of a price reduction for Ozempic, led to a notable increase in Novo Nordisk's share price, strengthening its position in the metabolic disease market.

          <p>MSNBC will be renamed "My Source News Opinion World," or MS Now, later this year as part of its separation from Comcast's NBCUniversal, becoming part of a new entity called Versant. This change, confirmed by Versant CEO Mark Lazarus, signifies NBCUniversal's decision to retain the NBC and peacock branding, allowing MS Now to establish an independent news organization. The re-branding will be supported by a significant marketing campaign, and the network is actively hiring to build its own newsroom, independent from NBC News. While the name changes, the network's focus remains the same, with key personalities expected to remain, as Versant spins off as a publicly traded company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bournemouth has agreed a deal worth an initial £20 million, plus a further £5 million in add-ons, to acquire Liverpool winger Ben Doak. The 19-year-old Scottish international is expected to complete his transfer, subject to paperwork and passing a medical, within the next 24 hours. This move aims to provide Doak with more opportunities for first-team football, as he has only made 10 appearances for Liverpool since joining in 2022. The sale contributes significantly to Liverpool's summer transfer income, which is nearing £200 million, largely from homegrown players. Meanwhile, Bournemouth is actively strengthening its squad with new signings ahead of the transfer window's close.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets and Yankees, despite their high-priced rosters and strong starts to the season, are currently struggling significantly as the MLB season nears its end. The Mets, after a record-setting signing of Juan Soto, are faltering due to a tired bullpen and poor starting pitching, particularly in August. The Yankees, while boasting a powerful offense led by Aaron Judge, are plagued by inconsistent relief pitching, sloppy defense, and a key reliever's struggles, despite acquiring new talent. Both teams, though still in playoff contention, need to urgently shore up their pitching and defense if they expect to meet their lofty postseason expectations and avoid an epic collapse, as the American League is weaker overall.</p>

          <p>China's public cloud services market for artificial intelligence experienced a significant surge, growing by 55% to reach US$2.7 billion in 2024. This boom is primarily driven by "disruptive innovations" towards generative and agentic AI, according to consultancy IDC. Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu are leading this rapidly expanding market, each commanding approximately 25% market share, with Tencent Holdings and Huawei Technologies following closely. The demand for AI cloud services has notably shifted from traditional applications to large language models since 2023, with services now evolving into autonomous, task-oriented AI interactions. This robust growth reflects increasing client needs for both generative AI applications and training resources to build their own AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's EV Industry Leads Nation's "Going Global" Economic Strategy</h2>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry, once primarily focused domestically, is now spearheading the country's "going global" economic strategy. For the first time last year, Chinese EV companies invested more overseas than at home, marking a historic shift from previous years where domestic investment dominated. This strategic pivot is driven by the Chinese government's hopes of forging an offshore economic empire and sidestepping intense domestic competition, where EV and battery factories currently operate significantly under capacity. A report by Rhodium Group highlights this trend, indicating a willingness to absorb higher costs, delays, and risks abroad in pursuit of international market expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Novo Nordisk Slashes Ozempic Price for U.S. Cash-Paying Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 09:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is now offering its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic for less than half its monthly list price to cash-paying U.S. patients, setting the cost at $499. This significant price reduction comes amid mounting political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs in the country, with President Donald Trump specifically urging companies to adopt direct-to-consumer models. The initiative aims to expand access for eligible Type 2 diabetes patients who lack insurance coverage for the weekly injection and to deter the use of cheaper, potentially unsafe compounded alternatives. This pricing strategy also highlights the intense competition in the GLP-1 market, where Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are actively vying for dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disability memoirs are undergoing a significant transformation, evolving beyond traditional inspirational narratives of overcoming adversity to embrace more complex and ambivalent portrayals of lived experience. Authors like Andrew Leland, Chloé Cooper Jones, and Raymond Antrobus are publishing "memoirs of ambivalence," exploring the nuances, contradictions, and burdens of impairment rather than solely focusing on triumph. These new works delve into the intellectual and philosophical aspects of disability, presenting it as a subject worthy of rigorous study and analysis. They challenge societal assumptions and stereotypes, allowing disabled writers to define their identities on their own terms, free from the pressure to perform for a "mainstream" audience, and fostering a deeper understanding of human experience.</p>

          <p>Google and Kairos Power are collaborating to deploy an advanced nuclear plant, Hermes 2, connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) electric grid by 2030. TVA has agreed to purchase up to 50 megawatts of power, marking the first utility power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor in the U.S. This partnership aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technology, with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk associated with building the first-of-a-kind project. The electricity will power Google's data centers, supporting their environmental goals and AI demand, while potentially ushering in a new era of more affordable and safer nuclear construction by creating a standardized design and supply infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced significant tax reforms, including a new two-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure of 5% and 18%, replacing previous higher levies. These changes, part of a push for self-reliance, aim to simplify compliance, lower tax rates, and modernize the GST framework to make it more growth-oriented, particularly benefiting manufacturing, logistics, housing, and consumer goods. The reforms are intended to bolster India's domestic consumption-driven economy, which the Reserve Bank of India forecasts to grow by 6.5% in fiscal year 2025-2026. This economic boost comes as India faces escalating U.S. tariffs, notably an additional 25% levy over its Russian crude oil purchases, with analysts suggesting the domestic measures could largely offset the tariff impact.

          <p>The Trump administration's directive to "Restore Truth and Sanity to American History" by removing "negative" information about Americans from U.S. national parks has met with significant public resistance. Despite notices asking visitors to report disparaging content, nearly 500 comments reveal that most visitors oppose sanitizing history, such as accounts of slavery or the mistreatment of Native tribes. Many praise park rangers and advocate for comprehensive historical accounts, including on Indigenous experiences and climate change. Critics within the National Park Service view this as an attempt to censor difficult topics and promote a "virtue-washed" version of history, which the American public has overwhelmingly demonstrated it does not support.</p>
