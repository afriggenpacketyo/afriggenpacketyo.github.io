        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates are showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts, remaining in a narrow range around 7% since early April. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88% last week. This lack of fluctuation has not incentivized homebuyers, who continue to face high house prices and limited inventory. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes decreased slightly, though they are up 11% from a year ago, and the average loan size for purchase applications has declined to the lowest level since January.

          <p>The British pound has reached its highest level in over three years, currently trading around $1.36, but analysts disagree on whether it will continue to rise. Much of the pound's recent strength is attributed to a weakening U.S. dollar, rather than inherent strength in the British currency, as evidenced by its depreciation against the euro. The pound's recovery follows a period of extreme lows after the 2022 mini-budget crisis, but it remains uncertain if it can sustain its gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S.-Israeli strikes had "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon analysis suggesting limited damage. The article details Trump's remarks alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, where he insisted Iran's program had been set back "basically decades." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's assessment, while Democratic senators called for answers and a return to negotiations. Despite continued exchanges, Trump expressed optimism about future U.S.-Iranian relations, likening the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan.</p>
