          <p>Actor Orlando Bloom described the intense physical and mental toll of losing 52 pounds for his role as a boxer in the upcoming film "The Cut." He admitted to being a "horrible person to be around," experiencing exhaustion, paranoia, and intrusive thoughts due to the grueling regimen. Bloom, who worked with a nutritionist, said his diet was eventually reduced to just tuna and cucumber for the final three weeks of filming. He explained that while he wouldn't recommend the process, the transformation was essential for his performance.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, amid transfer interest from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent win, has been the subject of an improved £35 million bid. Glasner emphasized that no suitable replacement has been found, making the defender's departure on the final day of the transfer window untenable. The manager's public stance puts pressure on the club's board to reject the offer and risk losing the player for free next summer.</p>

          <p>Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao has premiered her new film "Hamnet," an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. In an interview, Zhao revealed that she channeled her own "very painful fire," alluding to the difficult reception of her Marvel film "Eternals," into this more intimate project. She discussed her initial hesitation to direct a period piece about a topic she felt distant from, but ultimately found a profound personal connection. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been met with a rapturous response at the Telluride Film Festival.</p>

The Tivy Antlers' game against Del Rio was held at Antler Stadium, the same venue that had served as a volunteer hub and memorial site in the wake of the disaster. The traditional Friday night event offered residents a chance to come together and heal, demonstrating the significant cultural and emotional role of high school football in the community. The town is still in the early stages of recovery from the widespread damage.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles won their third straight men's Hundred title by defeating the Trent Rockets by 26 runs in the final at Lord's. Will Jacks was the star performer, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls to help his team post a competitive total of 168-5. In response, the Rockets' chase faltered significantly when Australian leg-spinner Nathan Sowter took three quick wickets for just three runs. Despite a late charge from Marcus Stoinis, who scored 64, the Rockets fell short, cementing the Invincibles' dynasty in the short-format cricket competition.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for takeoff in Texas, forcing officials to deplane the children and return them to government care. Attorneys for the minors argued the deportations were illegal, as the children were being denied their right to seek asylum and other legal protections. The government contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's advocates.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank against potential Russian threats. The decision represents a major victory for the British defense industry.</p>
