          <p>The United States and China have reported substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of trade tensions. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted they were "in-depth" and "candid." The meetings were the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. Both sides are expected to release full details of the talks, with potential tariff cuts under consideration.</p>

          <p>The Philippines held midterm elections, viewed as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte.

The results will also influence a potential impeachment trial for Duterte, highlighting the escalating feud between the two leaders.

Despite political rhetoric and promises to reduce net migration, numbers have remained historically high.

Recent data indicates a potential fall in net migration for 2024, though the full impact of policy changes remains to be seen.</p>

Concerns have been raised about the definition of groups affected and the potential conflict with the existing Hyde Amendment. With a narrow majority, House Republicans risk dissent that could jeopardize passage of the bill, which seeks to cut spending to fund Trump's priorities. The proposed legislation also targets Medicaid benefits for certain beneficiaries and repeals green energy subsidies.</p>
