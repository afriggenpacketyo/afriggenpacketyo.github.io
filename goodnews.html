          <p>Driven by internet culture and social media trends, the Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words, including viral terms such as 'skibidi,' 'delulu,' and 'tradwife.' Lexical managers noted that the internet is having a fascinating effect on the evolution of the English language and that new entries are selected based on their perceived staying power. The new additions reflect modern phenomena, from online slang popularized by Gen Z to terms like 'mouse jiggler' that emerged from remote work culture during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims of election rigging in the 2020 presidential election. The settlement follows a similar, larger payout by Fox News and avoids a jury trial where the network's malice could have been determined. Despite the payment, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and balanced, even as court documents revealed internal doubts about the fraud claims.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the medical journal JAMA reveals that the CDC's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP) had historically low rates of financial conflicts of interest when its members were dismissed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. The research found that the reported conflict rate for ACIP members had declined from nearly 43% in 2000 to just 5% by 2024. This data challenges the administration's stated rationale for firing the panel, which was based on concerns about industry influence.</p>

          <p>Financial experts recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple yet powerful way to benefit from compound interest. Instead of receiving dividend payouts as cash, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, often including fractional shares. Over the long term, this strategy can dramatically increase total returns, as demonstrated by the S&P 500, which saw significantly higher growth with dividends reinvested compared to price appreciation alone.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age for a senior to take out a reverse mortgage is typically in their late 60s to early 70s, though there is no single 'magic age.' This timing often represents a sweet spot where homeowners are more certain about their plans to age in place and have a clearer picture of their long-term income needs. The amount of equity that can be accessed increases with age, so waiting can allow for a larger loan, but the decision should ultimately be based on individual financial circumstances and goals.</p>
