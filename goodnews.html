          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he was not pressured by President Donald Trump on how to vote regarding interest rates during the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than was ultimately approved, confirmed he had a brief congratulatory call with the president but did not discuss his policy decision. This comes amid heightened scrutiny over the central bank's independence, as Trump has been openly critical of the Fed's policies and has sought to influence its decisions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the filing for containing excessive political rhetoric and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on the legal claims. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, allowing Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professionally structured complaint that adheres to standard legal formats and is limited to 40 pages.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence boom, led by Nvidia's success, has intensified investor focus on the semiconductor industry, leading to more concentrated exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While traditional funds like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) offer broad exposure, newer products provide more targeted strategies, such as equal-weighting or focusing on "fabless" chip designers. This trend allows investors to make more specific bets within the chip sector, though it also introduces different risk profiles compared to broader market investments. (not investment advice)</p>

While a framework for an agreement was reached earlier in the week, it remains unclear if the deal was fully completed during the call. The U.S. has been pressuring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. For a $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term, the average monthly payment has dropped to approximately $608, down from about $640 last September. Since HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust automatically to changes in the broader rate environment, allowing borrowers to benefit from monetary easing without needing to refinance.

A natural cross between a table grape and a red wine grape, it features a deep red pulp rich in anthocyanins and contains three times more resveratrol than blueberries. Dietitians suggest these compounds may offer significant health benefits, including antioxidant effects, improved gut health, and reduced inflammation. The unique grapes are designed to combine the taste of a sweet table grape with the high nutrient profile of a wine grape.</p>
