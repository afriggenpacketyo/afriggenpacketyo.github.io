          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces increasing pressure to demonstrate tangible results and differentiate his government from Reform UK. Acknowledging the need for more significant change, Starmer plans to restructure his Downing Street team and highlight his government's actions to counter Reform UK's growing influence. Reform UK has been actively dominating the political conversation, particularly on asylum issues, and the government is attempting to frame its approach as a thoughtful alternative to Reform's rhetoric. The core political question is whether people are losing patience with the current government's strategy and whether they will embrace Reform UK as a viable alternative, and Starmer is trying to answer this.</p>

          <p>Joe Gebbia, Airbnb co-founder, described his experience as "pretty unpleasant" after joining the Trump administration's government efficiency commission, DOGE. He said he received "hate mail text messages" and was disappointed that his work, which he viewed as public service, was being vilified. Gebbia joined DOGE in February to improve the federal retirement process and was later appointed as the US's first chief design officer, aiming to update government services. Despite the initial criticism, Gebbia remains committed to public service, striving to make the US the most beautiful and usable country in the digital world.</p>

          <p>Pickleball is rapidly gaining popularity in China, with online sales of related equipment skyrocketing this year. The racquet sport's rise is attributed to social media influencers and the resurgence of tennis in China, and locals are not only increasingly playing but also watching professional games. The U.S.-based Professional Pickleball Association's (PPA) first "Hong Kong Open" competition saw significant attendance, and the Hong Kong region now has many more pickleball courts. The sport's development in China is systemized, with the local tournament system run by the national Chinese Tennis Association, making it different from other countries.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors assessed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting and the impact of tariff uncertainties. A U.S. federal appeals court ruling against most of President Trump's global tariffs added to the market's cautious sentiment. India's markets were closely watched after Trump claimed India offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. imports to zero, and South Korea's consumer price index rose 1.7% in August. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission fined a local unit of Societe Generale for failing to prevent suspicious orders, and the country's current account balance showed a deficit.</p>

          <p>British newspapers highlight Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to create new senior roles at No. 10, with varying interpretations of the motivations behind the move. Some papers suggest Starmer is trying to regain control over economic policy, while others see it as undermining the Chancellor's authority. The newspapers also cover Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's criticism of Starmer's immigration policies, and medical experts calling for a ban on electronic cigarettes due to potential health risks. Additionally, reports indicate that AI tools are improving stroke diagnosis and that living on a noisy road may increase the risk of stroke.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Utah is addressing its housing affordability crisis by setting a goal to build 35,000 lower-cost starter homes in five years, as median home prices reach record highs. The state has introduced low-interest construction loans for starter homes and condos to incentivize developers, but progress has been slow. While Governor Spencer Cox urges builders and local leaders to prioritize affordable housing, experts suggest more sweeping zoning changes are needed to allow smaller lot sizes. One developer in Plain City is taking up the challenge by building starter homes priced under $400,000, with priority given to first-time buyers and essential workers.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner defeated Alexander Bublik in the fourth round of the US Open with a dominant performance, needing only one hour and 21 minutes. Bublik humorously labeled Sinner an "artificial intelligence" player after the match, and Sinner's victory extended his winning streak at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments to 25 matches. Sinner will face Lorenzo Musetti in an all-Italian quarter-final, marking the first time two Italian men have reached this stage at a Grand Slam, and the match promises to be a significant event for Italian tennis.</p>

Nadler was facing a primary challenge from 26-year-old Liam Elkind, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler's career as a champion for justice and civil rights.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team is developing a compact, detergent-free washing machine for astronauts, addressing the challenge of dirty laundry in space. The cube-shaped device cleans clothes with mist and ozone, using only 400ml of water per cycle for up to 800 grams of clothing. The machine uses ultrasonic atomization to deliver water as an ultra-fine mist, and ultraviolet light produces ozone to sterilize clothes. This innovation aims to provide a sustainable solution for astronauts to maintain clean clothing during space missions.</p>
