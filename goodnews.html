          <p>SK Hynix shares experienced a significant surge, reaching a 25-year high, following the announcement of its HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chip development, crucial for AI applications. The company's stock rose over 7%, marking its ninth consecutive day of gains, contributing to a broader rally in Asian markets, while Alibaba and Baidu saw their shares jump after deploying in-house AI training chips. Easing inflation and expectations of U.S. rate cuts are boosting investor sentiment, and overnight gains on Wall Street saw the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite reach new intraday and closing record highs. The CPI reading showed a slightly higher increase than expected, but markets remain optimistic about future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' season concluded with a decisive loss to the Las Vegas Aces, who secured a 103-75 victory, as the Aces set a WNBA regular-season record with 22 three-pointers, led by Jewell Loyd, Chelsea Gray, and A'ja Wilson. The Sparks, already out of postseason contention, aimed to finish with a winning record, but the Aces' talent proved too much to overcome, despite efforts from Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum. The game was marked by physical play, including an injury to Cameron Brink, and in the third quarter, Sparks coach Lynne Roberts gave rookies Sarah Ashlee Barker, Alissa Pili, and Sania Feagin playing time. The Aces dominated, highlighting the talent gap between the two teams.</p>

          <p>China has become the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, committing US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024, according to an official from Thailand. This investment accounts for 16% of all investment in the cluster, second only to Thailand itself, and Chinese investors are also involved in infrastructure projects, including a high-speed railway line, with a Chinese consortium joining a Thai group to build the 220km line. The railway project, which was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, is expected to take five more years to complete, and the Eastern Economic Corridor is a state-fostered industrial cluster covering three provinces south of Bangkok.</p>

          <p>Yankees manager Aaron Boone described the atmosphere as "awesome" after President Trump visited the team on the 24th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Trump met with the Yankees in the clubhouse, praising Aaron Judge, who responded with two home runs, and Boone noted the significance of Judge's performance on such a meaningful night. Boone shared that the players were initially intimidated but found Trump personable, and he believes the interaction was a positive experience for many. The game, a 9-3 win over the Detroit Tigers, was attended by over 40,000 people, who gave Trump a mostly positive ovation.</p>

          <h2>California Assembly Passes Controversial Housing Density Bill</h2>

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial bill that would override local zoning laws to increase housing density near public transit hubs, with a vote of 41 to 17, and the bill now awaits a final Senate concurrence vote and the Governor's signature to take effect. SB 79 allows for taller, denser housing near transit corridors, potentially impacting single-family neighborhoods, and supporters argue it's necessary to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it strips local authorities of control. The Los Angeles City Council opposed the bill, and protests have occurred in Southern California communities, but support surged after a deal with the State Building and Construction Trades Council. The bill adds union hiring to certain projects.</p>

          <p>As the multilateral system falters, the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is presented as a critical solution for the global order's ailments, and the United Nations is increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, with the Global South marginalized in decision-making. The article argues that new governance approaches are urgently needed to avoid further fragmentation, and the SCO embodies the five principles, providing a platform for countries of different cultures, ideologies, and political systems to cooperate. The SCO is seen as a response to states raising tariffs and undermining global institutions, while others call for reform but fail to deliver.</p>

          <p>Child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers advice on managing fussy eating, emphasizing that it's a normal part of development and advising parents not to blame themselves. The tips include allowing children to choose what they eat, avoiding labeling food as good or bad, prioritizing enjoyment during mealtimes, being mindful of appetite, and involving children in food preparation. Charlotte suggests allowing children to make their own decisions about eating and leaving the table when they want, while parents should model moderation and balance. She also recommends creating a fun and engaging environment at the dinner table, and seeking professional help if concerned about a child's limited diet or sensory issues.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, Play, comes after commercial misfires, with the artist seeking to "create joy and technicolour" after a difficult period, and the album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern influences, featuring instruments like the sitar and tabla. While Sheeran takes pains to get the details right, the album doesn't fully embrace these cultural influences, and the article notes that the Bollywood strings and Asian rhythms are assimilated into his brand of pop. The album has received mixed reviews, with some praising its enjoyable tunes and others finding it lacks depth and adventure, while Sheeran's lyrics are noted for their simplicity and unguarded nature.</p>
