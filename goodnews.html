          <p>Justin Halstenberg, 35, has been sentenced to 16 years to life in prison for igniting the Line Fire in San Bernardino County, which burned 44,000 acres in September 2024.

          <p>Formula 1 championship leader Oscar Piastri stated he learned important "lessons on risk" from a difficult race weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where he crashed out on the first lap. The McLaren driver acknowledged that he and the team cannot afford similar performances as the championship race tightens, with teammate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen closing the points gap. Ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, Piastri emphasized the need to stay focused on the strategies that have brought him success for most of the season.</p>

          <p>A team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate if an underwater "visual anomaly" is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, located in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, was identified in satellite imagery and has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. Researchers believe there is "very strong" evidence linking the object to Earhart's Electra 10E plane, potentially providing a definitive answer to the long-standing mystery.</p>

          <p>City leaders in Austin, Texas, are launching a new crime reduction strategy to address what they have identified as a "prominent violent crime hot spot" in the northeast part of the city.

This initiative is based on a Place Network Investigation (PNI) and involves collaboration with entities like the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission and the Austin Fire Marshall.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis of Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance argues against persistent conspiracy theories, asserting that she and navigator Fred Noonan simply ran out of fuel over the Pacific. The article suggests that the myths surrounding her fate, including tales of her being a spy captured by the Japanese, were fueled by her husband for profit and by wartime propaganda needs. It reframes Earhart not as a mysterious figure, but as a courageous and record-setting pilot whose true legacy as a pioneer for women in aviation is often overshadowed by sensationalism.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with lower share prices have greater potential for growth than more expensive ones. It argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value and that investment decisions should be based on fundamental analysis of a company's growth outlook. Using the example of Nvidia versus International Paper, it demonstrates how a focus on valuation and future earnings potential, rather than share price, is a more effective strategy for identifying high-growth opportunities.

          <p>Beyond her groundbreaking primatology research, Jane Goodall's most radical legacy may be her unwavering advocacy for animal rights, a stance rare among scientists of her stature. Her work led her to oppose factory farming and invasive animal experimentation, putting her at odds with scientific orthodoxy but making her a beloved figure in the animal rights movement. Goodall used her global platform to argue that humanity's exploitation of animals lacks a moral basis, pushing for a re-evaluation of both the ethics and scientific value of animal testing.</p>
