          <p>In an era of information overload and increasing reliance on AI, the fundamental purpose of higher education is to teach students how to think critically, not what to think. This article argues that a residential college experience remains a vital environment for developing essential human qualities like discernment, communication, and empathy, which AI cannot replicate. It emphasizes that face-to-face dialogue and interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial for navigating complex issues and overcoming the polarization amplified by social media. Universities must embrace technology while doubling down on their mission to foster the human skills necessary for leadership in a pluralistic democracy.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man has been sent back to France from the UK under the new "one in, one out" migrant exchange deal, following a successful legal battle by the government. The Home Office won the court case by tightening rules around human trafficking claims, allowing for the man's immediate removal. This marks a significant legal victory for the government's strategy to deter small boat crossings by demonstrating that individuals can be swiftly returned. The judge ruled that France is a safe country and that it was in the public interest to disrupt criminal smuggling operations.</p>

The couple, who had lived and run a charity in the country for nearly two decades, were held on undisclosed charges and their family had expressed grave concerns about their deteriorating health in detention. Following their release, they were flown to Qatar for medical evaluation before returning to the UK. The UK government expressed relief and gratitude to Qatar for its essential role in securing their freedom.</p>

          <h2>MI6 Launches Dark Web Portal to Recruit Spies, Targeting Russians</h2>

          <p>The British foreign intelligence service, MI6, has launched a secure portal on the dark web to attract and recruit new agents, with a particular focus on individuals in Russia. The initiative, called Silent Courier, aims to provide a confidential channel for potential spies to make contact with the agency. In his final public speech, outgoing MI6 Chief Sir Richard Moore made a direct appeal to potential recruits worldwide, while also delivering sharp criticism of Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine and China's support for Russia's war effort. The move is part of a broader strategy to leverage technology to enhance national security.</p>

          <p>Recent reports from OpenAI and Anthropic show that AI models like ChatGPT and Claude are being adopted at an unprecedented rate, far quicker than previous technologies like computers or electricity. The primary uses currently include practical advice, text generation, and information queries. However, this article cautions that current usage patterns may not predict the technology's long-term economic consequences, such as whether AI will complement or substitute human labor. While the rapid diffusion of AI is clear, its ultimate impact on wages, productivity, and the nature of work remains one of the most significant open questions.</p>

          <p>The renowned magical duo Penn & Teller have been inducted into the prestigious Magic Circle, ending a 50-year period during which they were barred from the organization. The pair, known as the "bad boys of magic," were famously excluded for their practice of revealing the secrets behind their tricks, a direct violation of the society's cardinal rule. The Magic Circle's president acknowledged their controversial past but praised their originality and artistic performances. The induction ceremony took place at the London Palladium, where the duo is currently performing their 50th-anniversary show.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup went on sale worldwide, drawing crowds from Beijing to London. The launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from local rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi. While initial preorder data in China appears strong, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises, which some analysts felt were underwhelming in their initial rollout. The new models, including the iPhone 17 Pro and the thinner iPhone Air, will need to impress consumers to maintain Apple's market position.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have unveiled a new agreement to manage legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles, replacing a widely opposed 2023 UK law. The new framework aims to provide "maximum truth, justice and accountability" for victims by restoring inquests that were previously halted and overhauling the legacy commission with independent oversight. A cross-border body will also be established to receive information from individuals, and Ireland will create a dedicated police unit to cooperate on cases. The deal represents a significant diplomatic effort to resolve a major point of contention between the two governments.</p>

          <p>The United States is investing in a Zambian copper and cobalt facility in an effort to secure a direct supply of critical minerals and lessen its dependence on China. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is providing a $1.4 million grant for a feasibility study to expand the Kazozu mine, which is operated by a subsidiary of a U.S. company. This move is a strategic response to China's dominance in the processing of cobalt, a mineral essential for electric vehicle batteries and military technology. The project aims to produce additional copper and cobalt concentrates for shipment to the U.S. and its allies.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man hiking alone in a remote area of Yellowstone National Park survived an encounter with a bear, believed to be a grizzly. The hiker apparently surprised the animal and sustained significant, though not life-threatening, injuries to his chest and arm while attempting to deploy bear spray. Park officials stated the bear was likely acting in self-defense after being startled and have closed the trail but will not take any management action against the animal. Bear attacks in the park are extremely rare, with only eight fatalities recorded since its establishment in 1872.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has overturned a $100,000 jury verdict against celebrity attorney Mark Geragos in a legal malpractice lawsuit. The suit was filed by a youth basketball coach who alleged Geragos and disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti had mishandled a potential settlement with Nike. While the jury found that Geragos had breached his duties, it also determined the coach was not substantially harmed, creating a legal contradiction. Both sides agreed to vacate the verdict, resulting in a judgment in favor of Geragos, who will no longer have to pay the damages.</p>
