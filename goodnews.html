          <p>Nicusor Dan, a pro-European and democratic candidate, has won the Romanian presidential election in an unexpected victory. Dan, a former civic activist and mayor of Bucharest, defeated right-wing extremist George Simion. His win is considered good news for Romania, the European Union, and Ukraine, as Simion would have led Romania on an isolationist, anti-European path. Dan has announced he will hold talks with all four democratic parties in parliament to form a government and has promised to uphold the rule of law and support Ukraine.</p>

The ruling Democratic Alliance of Prime Minister Lu√≠s Montenegro cemented its position as the dominant power in Portugal, allowing it to continue ruling as a minority government. Chega, a hard-right party that won over 22 percent of the vote, has positioned itself as a potent movement that is upending the country‚Äôs politics.

          <p>Nigerian women are advocating for a new 'Reserved Seat for Women bill' to increase their representation in parliament, where they are significantly underrepresented. The bill aims to reserve a set number of seats for women in federal and state legislatures, addressing the systemic exclusion they face in the political process. Supporters argue that more women in government could lead to better policies and a more stable economy, citing Rwanda as an example. Nigeria ranks poorly in women's representation globally, despite having many accomplished women in other fields.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lenders tend to offer differing rates for home equity loans and HELOCs, with home equity loans typically featuring higher, fixed rates, while HELOCs offer lower variable rates. The difference is due to the flexible draw periods enable lower initial HELOC rates, and the ongoing borrowing risk into variable rate structures. Flexible access: A HELOC lets you borrow as needed ‚Äî much like a credit card ‚Äî and offers flexibility for ongoing expenses. Potential tax benefits: According to Glick, those who finance home improvements with equity products may qualify for tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark deal aimed at strengthening security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced after Brexit. The agreement allows British people to use electronic gates in Europe, eases pet travel, and enables the sale of some British meat products in the EU. One of the most delicate issues was an extension of the right of European trawlers to fish in British territorial waters, in exchange for reduced trade barriers for British food products entering the E.U.‚Äôs giant single economic zone. The agreement is politically contentious for Mr. Starmer and has involved months of difficult negotiations.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire mom who suffered two strokes at a young age discovered she had a rare heart condition known as Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), prompting her to get her entire family checked. Doctors at Tufts Medical Center found that two of her three adult daughters also had holes in their hearts. All three women underwent a quick, outpatient procedure to close the holes using an Abbott Amplatzer device, overseen by the same doctor. The Strong family is now hoping their ASD devices will prevent any future strokes and keep their hearts strong.</p>
