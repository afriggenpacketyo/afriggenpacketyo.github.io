          <p>Australia is set to significantly upgrade its naval capabilities by purchasing 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal valued at $6.5 billion. The agreement, described as the largest defense-industry pact between the two nations, is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to counter China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific. This marks Japan's first major warship export since before World War II, reflecting a shift from its pacifist constitution. The first three frigates will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight constructed in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties over allegations of improper hazardous waste disposal. An investigation found that numerous UPS locations in the state had discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursements, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern California is entering peak tarantula mating season, which lasts from August through December, leading to a significant increase in spider sightings. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows and can travel up to 20 miles in search of a mate, making them more visible in areas like Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Experts note that while their appearance may be intimidating, local tarantula species are generally harmless to humans unless provoked. Their venom is not considered dangerous, though their bodies are covered in irritant hairs.</p>

This represents the first major ad buy in the race, with commercials set to air across all California markets as well as in New York City and Washington, D.C. Cloobeck, a conservative Democrat, aims to increase his name recognition among voters in a crowded field without a clear front-runner. He previously founded Diamond Resorts International and has been a major Democratic donor for years, but has never held public office.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle, in a cave in the Yorkshire Dales region of England. The discovery was made as part of the Ingleborough Cave Archaeology Project, which is exploring caverns and sinkholes to understand prehistoric life in the area. Researchers also found evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into how early humans lived and farmed in the region thousands of years ago, highlighting the long history of human interaction with the landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged more than 20% after President Trump praised the company's new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which faced online criticism for its visual style, was lauded by Trump on his Truth Social platform, where he contrasted it with what he termed "woke" advertising. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the retailer's stock, which had already seen a jump from retail traders. This surge provides a boost to American Eagle, which has recently faced financial headwinds, including withdrawing its full-year guidance due to slow sales.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is set to announce an expedited plan to develop and build a nuclear reactor on the moon, according to a directive from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. The move aims to establish a sustainable power source for future lunar and Mars missions and to strengthen U.S. national security in space. This directive accelerates existing NASA discussions and comes as China and Russia pursue a joint effort to place their own reactor on the moon by the mid-2030s. The plan for fission surface power is seen as essential for supporting a future lunar economy and long-term human exploration.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that an increase in colorectal cancer screenings among adults aged 45-49 is leading to more diagnoses at an earlier, more treatable stage. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this demographic rose by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This coincided with a significant jump in the incidence of early-stage cancer detection. While researchers call the findings promising, they caution that screening rates for this younger group remain suboptimal and have not increased equitably across all education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has attributed the stock market's recent rebound to the strong earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies. Despite a weaker-than-expected labor report and new tariff announcements that initially sent indexes lower, stocks reversed course, led by giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Cramer noted that these companies are performing exceptionally well across various segments, from cloud infrastructure to AI development, and their financial strength and multiple revenue streams make them resilient.

Emma Ambler has campaigned for tighter controls since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references instead of one for shotgun certificate applications and mandate that police investigate for signs of domestic abuse.
