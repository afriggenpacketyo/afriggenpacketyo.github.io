          <p>London City Lionesses have made France international Grace Geyoro the most expensive women's footballer in history, paying £1.4 million to sign her from Paris St-Germain. This transfer surpasses the previous record set last month, marking the third time the women's world record has been broken this summer. The move highlights London City's ambitious strategy under wealthy American owner Michele Kang, aiming to disrupt the Women's Super League's established order. Geyoro, a 103-cap France international, brings significant experience and talent to the newly promoted club, signaling a new direction for women's football with independent, women-focused club structures.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded higher after US President Donald Trump formalized a lower Japanese auto import tariff of 15%, down from 27.5%. The executive order also confirmed a $550 billion Japanese investment in US projects, positively impacting Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices. Additionally, several Asian chip stocks jumped following Trump's comments about imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not relocating production to the United States. This indicates a mixed but generally positive market reaction to the latest US trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analyst expectations, with clothing, footwear, and online retailers seeing strong growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed this boost to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. While this indicates a positive short-term trend, sales in the three months to July were still down compared to the previous quarter, and economists warn that these factors are temporary. Concerns about potential tax rises ahead of November's Budget may temper future retail sector growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya's Treasury is in advanced talks with the Export-Import Bank of China to extend maturities and swap dollar-denominated debt into yuan. This strategic move aims to ease pressure on Kenya's foreign reserves and could halve interest rates on loans for the Standard Gauge Railway from 6.37% to approximately 3%. The shift is considered a 'win-win' scenario for Kenya, offering significant financial relief by leveraging the difference between secured overnight financing rates and yuan rates. This highlights a growing trend of nations diversifying their debt currency to manage economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
