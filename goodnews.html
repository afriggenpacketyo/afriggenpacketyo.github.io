          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index-tracking ETFs, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing favor among investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily weighted towards the technology sector, which now comprises a record high of over 35% of the index. This concentration has led traders to explore other areas, such as small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. This shift indicates a broader search for returns beyond the market's largest companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its dependency on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. The move is a response to Beijing's recent export curbs, which have disrupted European industries and are seen as a strategic leverage tool in global trade disputes. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources through partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada, boosting domestic production and processing, and significantly increasing the recycling of critical raw materials from used products like batteries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, inspiring global river restoration efforts. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning to the revitalized ecosystem. To mark the milestone, 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the full length of the river in more than 100 years, a journey that connected them with their heritage and with other Indigenous activists from around the world. The project's success serves as a powerful model for environmental healing and collective action.</p>

          <p>The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, holds a unique place in U.S. history, having served as a temporary residence for President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison after the White House was burned by the British in 1814. Designed by the U.S. Capitol's first architect, the home was spared destruction because a French ambassador was staying there, allowing the French flag to fly over it. During their six-month stay, President Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent in the house's circular office, officially ending the War of 1812. The building is now a museum managed by the Architects Foundation.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a comfortable 26-6 victory over England in the first Rugby League Ashes match in 22 years, held at Wembley. The Kangaroos demonstrated superior quality, particularly in the second half, with standout fullback Reece Walsh scoring two tries. Despite a hard-fought effort from England, Australia's well-organized attack proved too much for the hosts to handle. The win puts Australia in a strong position for the series, while England will need to regroup for the second Test in Liverpool as they seek their first Ashes series triumph in 55 years.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls have consistently shown strong support for Connolly in the race for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a former barrister and an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, gained the backing of several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who has served the maximum two seven-year terms, and will become the third woman to hold the Irish presidency.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan, according to state media reports. This hands-on approach, described as playing a "decisive role," signifies his deep personal investment in shaping China's long-term economic and social development. The plan was reportedly formulated based on extensive investigations during Xi's national tours throughout the year, with multiple revisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation. This level of direct involvement underscores Xi's centralized authority and his personal stamp on the nation's strategic direction for the coming years.</p>

          <p>In its inaugural season, San Diego FC has made MLS history by setting records for the most wins and points by an expansion team, securing the Western Conference's top seed for the playoffs. The club's success is built on a philosophy that combines star players like Hirving "Chucky" Lozano with a strong focus on data analytics and homegrown talent. A key part of their strategy is the Right to Dream academy, an integrated school and training facility on Sycuan tribal land that develops young players from the San Diego and Tijuana regions. The team now aims to become the first expansion side to win the MLS Cup since 1998.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a bionic jellyfish robot, described as an "underwater phantom," designed for stealthy deep-sea surveillance and monitoring. The drone, created at Northwestern Polytechnical University, mimics the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish, using a transparent hydrogel material for its body and tentacles. Its design allows for near-silent operation and low power consumption, making it ideal for observing fragile ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, or conducting covert monitoring without detection. The compact device measures 120mm in diameter and weighs only 56 grams, enhancing its stealth capabilities.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has transformed his side hustle of flipping used items into a multi-million dollar wholesale clothing business named Technsports. Starting in 2008 after being laid off, Senko began by reselling a single cell phone and eventually focused on pre-owned clothing, building relationships with thrift stores and flea markets. In 2023, he shifted his model from individual online sales to buying clothes in bulk and selling them wholesale to other resellers, a move that generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024. His story illustrates how a small start with minimal capital can scale into a highly profitable enterprise.</p>
