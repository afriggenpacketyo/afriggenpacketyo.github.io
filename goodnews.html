          <h2>China Develops New Superalloy Technique to Advance Aircraft Engine Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique for superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in aircraft engines. The method involves rapidly cooling the forged metal, which could significantly enhance the performance, durability, and efficiency of jet engines. This technological advancement is considered crucial for China's ambitions to develop high-performance engines for its next-generation fighter jets, an area where the country has historically lagged behind Western nations. The breakthrough addresses long-standing challenges in producing components that can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees star Aaron Judge is using a bat inscribed with a Bible verse, 2 Corinthians 5:7, for the MLB All-Star Game. The passage, which reads "For we live by faith, not by sight," is a favorite of Judge's, reflecting the prominent role of his Christian faith in his life. Judge, who is having an exceptional season leading the majors in several key offensive categories, has often spoken about the importance of his faith over his baseball career. This personal touch on his equipment highlights a key aspect of his character off the field.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to ever finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the 'world's toughest foot race.' The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley in extreme heat. This was a redemption for Becker, who had failed to finish within the 48-hour time limit in 2022. This year, he completed the race with three hours to spare, showcasing remarkable determination and endurance. Becker, who began running ultramarathons at age 60, credited his dedicated support crew and coaches for his successful finish.</p>

          <h2>Port of Los Angeles Experiences Record June Traffic as Shippers Rush to Preempt Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record number of shipping containers in June, an 8% increase over the previous year. Port executives attribute this surge to a 'tariff whipsaw effect,' where importers accelerated shipments of goods to get ahead of President Trump's looming tariff deadlines, particularly those on Chinese products. While this created the busiest June in the port's history, officials anticipate that volumes will likely decrease once the new, higher tariffs take effect in August. The situation highlights the uncertainty and strategic shifts businesses are making in response to ongoing trade policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, with an expected sale price of up to $4 million. The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Such meteorites are extremely rare, offering invaluable scientific data about the red planet's composition and history, making this a significant event for both collectors and researchers.</p>

Proponents argue this infrastructure is vital for industries like salmon farming and the local spaceport.
