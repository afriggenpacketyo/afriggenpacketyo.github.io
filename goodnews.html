          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a 22-year-old inmate, was recaptured after escaping from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail in Louisiana for the second time in a year. Johnson, awaiting trial for a home invasion case, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, creating a distraction. Authorities suspect another inmate helped him over the perimeter fence. This incident prompted administrative leave for at least four individuals pending a full review. Johnson's previous escape in May 2024 involved breaking through the jail's perimeter fence during recreation time, highlighting ongoing security concerns at the facility. The escape occurred amid an ongoing search for inmates who escaped from a jail in New Orleans.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal to connect the resource-rich Jiangxi province with the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost $44.4 billion, is part of a larger initiative to enhance inland water transport and reduce logistical expenses. Once completed, the canal will facilitate the transport of goods, particularly from Jiangxi's electric vehicle manufacturing hub, to Zhejiang's seaports. Designed as a Class III waterway, it will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle approximately 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, integrating less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers to make it available at 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This move aims to curb rising rice prices, which have doubled due to a poor harvest and increased demand from tourism. The government intends to begin negotiated contracts with retailers and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. Koizumi also plans to publish weekly retail rice prices by region and examine distribution channels. The move follows criticism of the government's failure to control rice prices amid broader inflation concerns.</p>

          <p>A water leak affected all seven floors of the recently constructed Dr. Allen and Charlotte Ginsburg Human-Centered Computation Hall at USC, a high-tech computer science building. The leak originated from the attic, and the university's facilities planning and management department is working on repairs. The building, which opened in September, houses advanced technology, including robotics labs and a two-story autonomous aerial vehicle research lab. Ginsburg Hall is the first building at USC to earn a LEED platinum certification and became a popular study spot for students. Researchers have been notified to check their equipment, and the building is closed for repairs.</p>
