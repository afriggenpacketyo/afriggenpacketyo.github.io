        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's core inflation for August eased to 0.3%, its lowest level since February 2021 and below economists' expectations, primarily due to a decrease in services costs like holiday expenses and airfares. Headline inflation also fell slightly to 0.5%, with the main upward pressure coming from rising car prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has maintained its full-year inflation forecast, suggesting that disinflationary pressures from weaker global demand will likely offset potential impacts from ongoing trade conflicts. The nation is also bracing for slower economic growth in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third week of the NFL season delivered a series of dramatic finishes, with five games decided on the final play, often by kickers and backup quarterbacks. The Cleveland Browns secured a major upset over the Green Bay Packers with a walk-off field goal, while the Philadelphia Eagles staged their largest home comeback since 1988 against the Los Angeles Rams, blocking a game-winning field goal attempt and returning it for a touchdown to remain undefeated. Other notable results included the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts also moving to a 3-0 start with last-minute victories, highlighting a weekend of unpredictable outcomes.</p>

          <p>Writing in response to recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump linking paracetamol to autism, Australian pediatrician Mike Freelander emphasizes that the medication is safe for use during pregnancy. He argues there is no scientific evidence of causation and points to large-scale studies that have disproved a causative link, despite some noted associations. Dr. Freelander warns that such unscientific claims from political figures cause significant distress and can lead to poor health outcomes if pregnant individuals avoid necessary medication for safer, but less effective, alternatives. He urges the public to trust established medical regulatory bodies like Australia's TGA.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which had been frozen over allegations of civil rights violations. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, stating the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific reasons for the cuts. The frozen funds include hundreds of medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health for studies on cancer, Parkinson's disease, and other critical areas. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal battles between universities and the administration over federal funding.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Modern Football Is Adopting Tactics Popularized by Sam Allardyce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 01:14:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis suggests that modern football coaching is increasingly embracing tactics once championed, and often criticized, by manager Sam Allardyce. Strategies such as a more direct, long-ball style of play, a focus on set-pieces, and the use of a large center-forward are becoming more common in the Premier League. The article notes that even analytical approaches, like a coach watching from the stands for a better tactical overview, were pioneered by Allardyce decades ago. Allardyce himself comments that he was "ahead of the game" and that the sport is now seeing the statistical benefits of these pragmatic approaches.</p>

          <p>Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, has identified resilience as the most critical leadership quality for navigating the fashion industry's current challenges, including U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. Appointed in April 2025, Weir's tenure began as President Trump imposed new levies on key manufacturing regions, impacting many brands. Weir emphasized the importance of listening and open dialogue with designers, politicians, and American counterparts to mitigate the commercial impact of these policies. Her leadership style aligns with a recent survey where over 60% of business leaders cited resilience as the top quality for modern executives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While major European financial centers like London and Frankfurt are experiencing a downturn in public listings, the Stockholm Stock Exchange has emerged as the continent's leading market for initial public offerings (IPOs). This success is attributed to a combination of factors, including a deeply ingrained national "equity culture," a diverse pool of domestic capital, and a supportive regulatory framework that encourages investment. The article highlights that decades of government policy have fostered high retail investor participation, with a mature ecosystem featuring "cornerstone" investors and a steady pipeline of companies from private equity creating a robust market.

          <p>During a rare visit to Beijing, a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers discussed a potential major aircraft deal between Boeing and China with top Chinese officials. U.S. Ambassador David Perdue indicated that negotiations for the sale of as many as 500 jets are in their final stages, marking a potential breakthrough for the American manufacturer in a key market where orders have stalled amid trade tensions. The visit, the first by a House of Representatives delegation since 2019, aims to improve relations and also included discussions on re-establishing military-to-military dialogue to prevent miscalculations between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison in Egypt after nearly six years and reunited with his family. His release came after a presidential pardon, reportedly following a request from the National Council for Human Rights. Abdel Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, was sentenced to five years in 2019 for "spreading false news." His case drew international attention, particularly after his mother, Laila Soueif, undertook an extensive hunger strike to call for his freedom. His release is seen as a significant development, though his ability to travel to the UK remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new ITV drama series titled "The Hack" will explore the phone hacking scandal that rocked the British media, starring David Tennant as the investigative journalist who exposed the practice. Writer Jack Thorne, known for "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," praised the real-life journalists whose work uncovered a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and the police. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, which gained widespread attention only after being dramatized, the phone hacking story is a celebration of journalism successfully holding its own industry to account. The series will tell the story from both journalistic and police perspectives.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has agreed to participate in a televised town hall after previously withdrawing in protest of ABC's suspension of host Jimmy Kimmel. Mamdani had initially pulled out to stand against what he called corporate cowardice in the face of government pressure on free speech. Following Disney's announcement that Kimmel's show would be reinstated, Mamdani reversed his decision. The incident became a notable event in the mayoral race, where Mamdani holds a significant lead in polls against opponents including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Eric Adams, who are both running as independents.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, ending a suspension that followed the host's jokes about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which came after the FCC threatened to revoke ABC's broadcast licenses, ignited a nationwide debate over free speech and censorship, drawing criticism from media figures and civil liberties groups. In its statement, Disney said the decision was reached after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. However, Sinclair, a major ABC affiliate group, stated it would replace the show with news programming and is still evaluating its potential return.</p>
