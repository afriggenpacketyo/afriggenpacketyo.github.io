        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Denzel Washington has voiced strong opposition to "cancel culture," questioning the modern emphasis on public support and online followers. In a recent interview, he stated that he does not fear being "canceled" because his guidance comes from his faith in God, not from popular opinion or social media trends. Washington argued that one cannot simultaneously lead and follow, asserting his commitment to following a higher spiritual power rather than man. He suggested that immunity from cancel culture comes from not seeking validation from it in the first place.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the intense water pressure pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation involving a dive team and a drone located him alive behind the cascade. A California Highway Patrol helicopter ultimately hoisted him to safety, where he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>A top Chinese scientist is calling for an accelerated, top-down national strategy to advance the development of space-based solar power technology. Ge Changchun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences argued that such an initiative is crucial for China to gain a competitive edge in the new energy sector and close the technology gap with the United States. Space solar power involves orbiting stations that collect intense solar radiation, convert it to electricity, and transmit it to Earth, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. China's current efforts are largely fragmented across universities and lack the scale needed for such a complex project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting philosophy known as the "Lighthouse Parent" is being presented as a healthier alternative to the trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children, offering illumination and safety when needed without controlling every aspect of their lives. Proponents argue that while the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, it can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The concept suggests that allowing children to navigate their own struggles, with the parent as a reliable beacon, fosters more capable and self-assured individuals.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he placed for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A UK court granted the forfeiture order after the police force argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, part of the same investigation that previously seized £2.7 million from Tate and his brother. The funds originated from a cryptocurrency account tied to their online businesses, for which no tax or VAT had been paid. The seized money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives in the local community.</p>

The organization hosts an annual event where it kits out each student with these necessities, aiming to level the playing field and reduce the sense of otherness they might feel compared to peers who arrive with family support. This initiative addresses a critical gap in support systems, which often focus on tuition but overlook practical living needs.</p>

          <h2>Therapist Advocates for Waking Up Early as Key Daily Ritual for Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 10:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, identifies waking up early as the single most important morning ritual for setting a positive tone for the day. She emphasizes that this practice is not about rigidly structuring the extra time but about creating a personal, unhurried space before work and household demands begin. By simply committing to getting up when her alarm goes off, she avoids feeling rushed and chaotic, which can trigger anxiety. This additional time allows for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or taking a longer dog walk, fostering creativity and a sense of calm.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home located within Windsor Great Park. This move will see the family relocate from their current residence at Adelaide Cottage, though they will remain close by, allowing their children to continue attending the nearby Lambrook School. The relocation follows their 2022 move from Kensington Palace to Windsor and comes after the recent publication of royal finances, which announced cost-saving measures. Forest Lodge, nestled in a 4,800-acre park, aligns with the Princess's publicly stated belief in the healing power of nature.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania couple, Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney, took out a $1 million loan and used their life savings to purchase and save Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre, the world's oldest operating drive-in. Opened in 1934, the historic Orefield theater was at risk of being sold to developers before the couple intervened in 2022. By shifting to year-round operation and hosting community events like craft fairs and car shows in addition to movie screenings, they have revitalized the business. After an initial struggle, the theater became profitable in 2024, generating nearly $550,000 in revenue and ensuring the preservation of a piece of film history.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, driven by its innovative foldable phones and a wider range of price points. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share of shipments surged from 23% to 31%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to Canalys. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's new Z Fold and Z Flip models are generating significant social media buzz and challenging the static design of the iPhone. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer and, eventually, foldable models to compete in the evolving high-end market.</p>

Rothwell used the service to run a multi-million-pound drug and firearms trafficking operation, which included arranging a gangland shooting where an innocent man was injured.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three practical steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the capacity to manage stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. The first step is to visualize the learning process as a winding path, not a straight line, to better tolerate the frustration of not knowing something immediately. The second involves engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as part of the growth process. Finally, she recommends undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds the body's tolerance for discomfort and fosters resilience over time.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. Trump stated on social media that the discussions would focus on a peace agreement to end the war, rather than a temporary ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and several European leaders, who reportedly welcomed U.S. willingness to provide security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a potential deal. This development shifts the focus to direct talks involving Kyiv, with Trump suggesting a subsequent meeting with Putin could follow if progress is made.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in self-reported drinking frequency and growing public concern over the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where rates of alcohol use have dropped significantly since the 1990s. This public health shift is seen as overwhelmingly positive, potentially leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths, diseases, and social harms.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director Kash Patel has won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against a blogger who accused him of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after the blogger, Jim Stewartson, failed to respond to the lawsuit in court. The judge found that Stewartson acted with actual malice in making the defamatory false statements. Stewartson claimed he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described the legal action as an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting on Patel's activities.</p>

The device detected a submerged car, which divers later recovered and found to contain human remains.

Authorities believe the remains belong to Benn and have notified his surviving next of kin.
