          <p>After a three-day strike, NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) reached an agreement, ending New Jersey's first rail strike in decades. While the engineers approved the deal, train service will not immediately resume. NJ Transit needs approximately 24 hours to conduct safety checks and reposition equipment, so full service is expected to restart on Tuesday, May 20. In the meantime, the agency will continue to follow the strike contingency plan, which includes bus service from designated park-and-ride lots. </p>

          <p>House Republicans pushed President Trump's budget package forward after overcoming initial resistance from conservative members concerned about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to some conservatives voting 'present,' allowing the bill to advance through the House Budget Committee. The legislation, which includes extending tax cuts and increasing spending on military and border security, faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition in the Senate. Speaker Johnson anticipates minor modifications and aims for a floor vote before Memorial Day, despite ongoing disagreements over Medicaid work requirements and clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidency after a challenging race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion had initially gained momentum due to anger over the annulled presidential race from the previous year, which was marred by claims of Russian interference. Dan secured 54% of the vote, emphasizing unity and change, while Simion attacked the EU and called for reduced aid to Ukraine. The election occurred amidst broader unhappiness with mainstream parties and political instability in the EU and NATO member state.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing expectations and signaling continued concerns about consumption in the country's economy. However, industrial output grew by 6.1%, surpassing estimates, suggesting that the impact from U.S. tariffs was not as severe as anticipated. The urban unemployment rate eased slightly to 5.1%. Trade-war fears have subsided after a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives led to a partial rollback of tariffs, prompting some investment banks to raise their forecasts for China's economic growth. </p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a secret within its walls: 70-year-old fresco murals, leading some to call it the 'Sistine Chapel of Maine.' Painted by artists in the 1950s, these murals have gained renewed interest due to a website created by Colby University students. The meeting house, built in 1842, features biblical scenes like 'The Last Supper' and 'The Binding of Isaac'. Today, the unlocked meeting house serves as a space for community gatherings and artistic events, continuing to inspire art enthusiasts decades later.</p>

          <p>GP patients to help NHS find more infected blood victims\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nGPs in England and their patients are to help the NHS find more victims of the contaminated blood scandal. It is thought thousands of people could have been exposed to the hepatitis C virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s and 90s; part of a scandal which affected more than 30,000 people in the UK. From June, patients signing up to a GP practice, who received a blood transfusion before 1996, will be offered a test for hepatitis C. The BBC revealed the scale of undiagnosed cases last year, as people with life-threatening liver damage caused by the virus over many years continue to be identified.\n\n'Horrifying impact'\n\nHepatitis C can now be treated by modern anti-viral drugs to eliminate the virus for most patients. But if it goes undetected and undiagnosed there may not be any noticeable symptoms for some time and it can infect the liver and cause serious damage, leaving the organ beyond repair.\n\nFamily photo Maureen Arkley was diagnosed with hepatitis C more than 40 years after being infected in a blood transfusion\n\nMaureen Arkley, who died last year, was diagnosed with hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver in 2023, more than 40 years after she had an operation involving multiple blood transfusions. These were on her medical records but she was not told by her GP or anyone in the NHS that she could have been exposed to the virus. BBC News highlighted her case as one of many people let down by the lack of testing following the infected blood scandal. It is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products have died. Many of the victims were haemophiliacs, who were given infected blood products as part of their treatment. Many thousands more were given transfusions using contaminated blood after accidents, emergencies or childbirth. Maureen died in February 2024, five months after her diagnosis and 47 years after a blood transfusion infected her. "The end was utterly horrific, she weighed less than four stone when she died," her daughter Victoria told the BBC.</p>
