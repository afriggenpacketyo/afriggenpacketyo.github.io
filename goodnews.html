          <p>Audio footage from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has been released, revealing instances of memory lapses. The recording captures Biden struggling to recall key dates, such as the year he left office as vice president and the date of his son Beau's death. The release of the audio coincides with plans from the Trump administration to release the full interview recording. Hur's report had previously described Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as strong winds blew dust from dry farmlands, creating a thick haze. The National Weather Service reported significantly reduced visibility on major interstates, leading to travel disruptions. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of dust and scattered showers. The storms also caused ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports, which have since been lifted. Cooler weather is expected over the weekend, but a rainy pattern is forecast to return next week.</p>

A new team has been established to lead infrastructure and technological development, combining AI predictions with existing numerical forecasting models.

Humans will still play an oversight role and issue final forecasts, even with AI predictions.</p>

          <p>Fujii Shuzo, a sake brewery in southwestern Japan with over 150 years of history, has begun offering a seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques. The five-day seminar is part of a course organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aiming to spread awareness and appreciation about sake beyond Japan. The brewery hopes that opening up to people from overseas will eventually lead to increased exports to Europe. While domestic sake consumption has declined, exports have recently increased due to growing popularity abroad.</p>

The life-size statue, which had replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, disappeared from its perch this week. Local residents suspect it may have been an act of vandalism or melted down for cash. The statue, which never quite captured the hearts of Sevnica's residents, was commissioned by an American artist as an interrogation of President Trump's immigration policies.</p>
