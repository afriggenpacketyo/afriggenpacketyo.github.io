        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to a larger-than-expected oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day for August. This decision accelerates the unwinding of previous voluntary supply cuts, citing a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals as key drivers. The move comes as the alliance aims to balance supply with rising summer demand and geopolitical tensions that have recently influenced oil prices. The group is moving more quickly than its initial plan to gradually restore production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Impotence Drugs Like Viagra May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 06:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have significant cancer-fighting potential. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug could strengthen the immune system's response to tumors by restoring dendritic cells, which are crucial for anti-tumor immunity. These 'intelligence agents' of the immune system often become depleted as cancer progresses. The discovery is being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment research.</p>

          <p>In Pasadena, a community came together in a massive show of support for Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale stand after she became too fearful to work following recent immigration raids. Organized by a community activist, hundreds of customers lined up to buy out his entire stock, raising over $1,500 to help his family with bills and rent. The event highlights the profound impact of federal immigration enforcement on local communities, as well as the powerful, positive response from residents who sought to help a family in need.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it calls a 'positive response' to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations immediately. However, the group has requested several changes, including a halt to a U.S.-backed aid system and a U.S. guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The 60-day ceasefire plan is believed to include the staggered release of remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. This development offers a potential path forward, with President Trump suggesting a deal could be reached next week.</p>

          <h2>Debate Explores Whether Crying at Work Is a Sign of Weakness or Emotional Strength</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:31:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a UK Chancellor's tearful appearance in public, a broader conversation has emerged about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. While some still view it as a sign of weakness, particularly in male-dominated environments, many are pushing back against this old-fashioned notion. Executive coaches and employees argue that showing emotion is human and that emotional intelligence is a strength, not a liability. Progressive employers are learning that creating a compassionate environment where staff feel supported can lead to greater motivation, loyalty, and productivity in the long run.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has solidified his role as a crucial and influential player within the Trump administration, notably helping to push the president's major tax and spending bill through Congress. Vance engaged in key negotiations with Senate holdouts and cast several tie-breaking votes, demonstrating his effectiveness as the administration's 'eyes and ears' in the Senate. His influence extends to foreign policy, where he has defended the president's decisions on conflicts like the one between Israel and Iran. This active role positions Vance as a powerful figure and a potential successor to Trump in 2028.</p>

          <p>The credit scoring company FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans into some of its scoring models this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of services like Affirm and Klarna, which allow consumers to split purchases into installments. For consumers, this means that on-time BNPL payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their score. Lenders have sought this data to gain a more complete picture of a borrower's financial obligations and avoid extending excessive credit.</p>

          <p>China's state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, Shandong province. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This output will help cut carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The innovative design allows the solar panels to rise and fall with the tide, and their proximity to the water's surface increases their energy generation efficiency.</p>

As a key ally of Tehran, Beijing has intensified its criticism of the attacks while positioning itself as a key mediator and responsible global power.

          <p>Recent studies are reigniting the debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, with conflicting results on the perception of visual illusions. One study suggests people from 'carpentered' Western environments see illusions differently than those from rural Namibian communities. However, another study convincingly dismantles this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author suggests that perception is an active construction by the brain, not a direct window to reality, and that understanding our own perceptual biases can foster a much-needed humility about how we see the world.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened its Seine River to public swimmers. The city has established three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with lifeguards, changing rooms, and showers. This historic move is a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which spurred a €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve the river's water quality, which had been banned for swimming since 1923 due to pollution. The initiative is part of a broader city effort to adapt to climate change and improve the quality of life for residents and tourists.</p>
