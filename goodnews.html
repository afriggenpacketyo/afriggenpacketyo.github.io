          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks for long-term investment, citing strong growth drivers related to artificial intelligence. Snowflake is favored for its accelerating product innovation in the data and AI space, with significant growth potential still ahead. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) received an upgrade following a major partnership with OpenAI, which is seen as a strong validation of its AI roadmap. Dell Technologies also raised its long-term financial targets, backed by strong enterprise demand for its AI server solutions, suggesting its growth outlook may be conservative.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Baby Boomers' Loyalty to Department Stores Stems from Underappreciated Perks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While younger generations increasingly shop online, many older consumers, particularly baby boomers, remain loyal to traditional department stores. This loyalty is attributed to perks that are often overlooked by Gen Z, such as more generous return policies, free shipping for out-of-stock items, and personalized customer service from stylists. Retail analysts note that while department stores face challenges competing with the "tiktokification of retail," they offer a different value proposition built on service and in-person experience. Stores like Bloomingdale's are leaning into this by focusing on luxury brands and high-touch service to appeal to their core, higher-income clientele.</p>

          <p>Organizers and residents in Chicago are hopeful that the city's annual marathon will proceed successfully despite recent increases in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. The marathon route passes through diverse neighborhoods, including the predominantly Latino area of Pilsen, where community groups have been actively educating residents on their rights. While some undocumented runners have expressed fear about participating in public events, local business owners and run clubs are encouraging community solidarity. Mayor Brandon Johnson has framed participation in the marathon as an act of resistance against what he calls federal efforts to undermine the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England coach Shaun Wane is confronted with several challenging selection choices ahead of announcing his squad for the autumn Ashes Test series against Australia. Key decisions are needed in the halves, where standout performances from players like Mikey Lewis and Jake Connor are challenging established choices. There are also dilemmas at hooker and among the three-quarters, with a wealth of in-form players competing for limited spots. Additionally, with several veteran forwards aging, Wane must decide whether to introduce younger front-rowers to build for the future against a formidable Australian team.</p>

          <p>As a ceasefire takes hold in Gaza, Israel's defense minister has announced plans to destroy all of Hamas's remaining underground tunnels once the hostage release is complete. The operation to dismantle the extensive tunnel network, which Israel says has been used for attacks, would be carried out by the Israeli military under U.S. supervision. This statement clarifies one of Israel's key objectives for the post-conflict phase. Meanwhile, international leaders, including the German Chancellor and the Pope, have expressed support for the peace plan and are preparing to attend a summit in Egypt aimed at finalizing the agreement.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Use AI to Uncover Hidden Similarities in Proteins of Unrelated Species</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 06:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has utilized an advanced AI protein language model to investigate convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. Traditional methods for studying this phenomenon focus on simple sequence similarities, but the AI model was able to analyze complex, high-order features like 3D protein structures. This allowed the scientists to identify a previously underrated sequence basis for why different species, such as bats and dolphins with echolocation, develop proteins that serve a similar function despite evolving separately. The findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms driving evolutionary adaptation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests three technology companies as solid investments to hold for the next decade, based on powerful, long-term trends. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is positioned to benefit from the world's growing demand for advanced chips for AI and other technologies. Amazon's growth is expected to be driven by its high-margin cloud computing (AWS) and digital advertising businesses. Nvidia's dominance in GPUs for AI is seen as sustainable, as the constant need to replace and upgrade these chips in data centers will create a form of recurring revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the start of a new ceasefire, preparations are underway to significantly increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the war-torn Gaza Strip. Israeli authorities expect the number of aid trucks to reach around 600 per day, a crucial step to address the severe hunger crisis and famine in parts of the territory. The United Nations has vast quantities of food and medicine ready for delivery once clearance is given. For residents of Gaza, the halt in fighting has allowed some to begin returning to their homes, many of which have been reduced to rubble after two years of devastating conflict.</p>

          <h2>Elite Footballers Increasingly Turn to Private Coaches for a Competitive Edge</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of top-tier footballers, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, are hiring private coaches to supplement the training they receive at their clubs. These coaches offer highly personalized sessions focused on specific skills or scenarios that may not be addressed in a group setting. The one-on-one attention allows players to work on weaknesses and build confidence away from the pressure of team management. While some clubs are wary of the potential for injury, many private coaches emphasize the importance of collaborating with the club's staff to ensure their sessions complement the team's schedule and goals.</p>
