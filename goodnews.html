          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, which includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties argue this could undercut British workers, but the government insists the deal will not impact them, citing existing agreements preventing double taxation. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India by ¬£25.5bn a year by 2040, particularly benefiting UK exports like whisky and cars. The Scotch Whisky Association anticipates a ¬£1bn increase in Scotch exports to India over five years, creating 1,200 jobs in the UK.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges AI faces in forecasting, despite its increasing sophistication. While AI models are improving, human superforecasters still outperform machines in prediction tournaments. The best AI model in a recent competition used a simple approach, pulling news articles and asking a language model to make predictions. AI's limitations include poor quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research skills. However, AI could potentially surpass humans in forecasting due to its ability to learn from mistakes and avoid biases. As AI forecasting improves, it could have significant implications for various fields, from law to medicine.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden discussed his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, acknowledging it was difficult but ultimately the right choice. He criticized President Trump's approach to Ukraine as "modern-day appeasement" and expressed concern about the future of the US-Europe alliance. Biden also defended his administration's accomplishments, including expanding NATO, and lamented Trump's lack of decorum and disregard for long-standing alliances.

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares increased after the company indicated that sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug are projected to improve in the second half of the year, with the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, but reduced its full-year sales growth forecast due to competition from compounded alternatives in the U.S. The FDA's decision to remove semaglutide injectables from the drug shortage list is expected to curb sales of compounded alternatives. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to lower Wegovy costs.</p>

          <p>The Real ID Act deadline has arrived, requiring Americans to have a Real ID to board domestic flights. However, the rollout appears to be a soft launch, with travelers without Real IDs still able to fly after additional screening. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said travelers may face extra steps but will still be allowed to board. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to enhance security at airports by establishing standards for identification. Some citizens have resisted applying for the new IDs, raising concerns about data privacy. It is unclear when the government will begin denying boarding to travelers without a Real ID.</p>

          <p>This article explores the importance of trust in relationships and the factors that contribute to its erosion. Research suggests that political polarization, economic inequality, and technology play a role in declining trust levels. Trust is built on competence, benevolence, and integrity, with initial judgments often based on imperfect cues. While some inclination to trust is genetic, distrust is learned through negative experiences. To foster trust, the article suggests approaching differences with curiosity, embracing a team mindset, and leaning into transparency.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, Fifa's head of global development, has proposed a change to the offside rule that would benefit attackers. Under the proposed change, an attacker would be considered onside if any part of their body is in line with the last outfield defender. Wenger argues this would restore an advantage to the attacker that has been eroded by VAR. Trials of the system have already taken place in Italian youth football, and further trials will happen before a final decision in 2026. Any change to the offside rule rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab).</p>
