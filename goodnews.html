        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are leveraging the "first sale rule," a decades-old U.S. customs law, to reduce the financial impact of tariffs. This rule allows importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the overseas producer to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the U.S. retailer. By using the factory price, companies can strip out the middleman's profit and pay a lower import duty. The first sale rule requires at least two sales, independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price.</p>

          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or expanding their nuclear energy programs as they seek greater energy independence. Denmark is analyzing advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind power. Germany has dropped its opposition to atomic power, while Spain has signaled an openness to reviewing the shutdown of its nuclear plants. This shift is partly driven by the costs associated with renewables, and a desire for more reliable energy sources, but Denmark explicitly stated they do not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions board is considering a proposal to implement sudden-death extra time, known as 'golden point,' if the deciding third Test against Australia in 2025 ends in a draw. Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the idea, aiming to enhance fan engagement and provide a definitive outcome instead of a shared series. The proposal would need agreement from both parties, with the Lions board set to make the final decision. The proposal is designed to give the fans what they want, and that is a definite conclusion to the match.</p>

          <p>Following an incident where a vehicle rammed into a crowd in Liverpool, injuring dozens, the Merseyside Police promptly announced that the driver was a 53-year-old white British man. This decision was made to counter the spread of misinformation that has occurred after other violent episodes in Britain. The police aimed to avoid a situation similar to a previous incident in Southport, where false anti-Muslim reports circulated online after a stabbing. By quickly releasing the driver's race and nationality, the police sought to defuse potential rumors and prevent the spread of false information.</p>

          <p>Leaders from China, Southeast Asia, and six Arab nations convened their first summit in Malaysia to enhance economic cooperation amidst global trade tensions.

The combined GDP of these regions totals $24.87 trillion with a population of approximately 2.15 billion.
