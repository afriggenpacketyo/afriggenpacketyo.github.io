          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a rally following the White House's announcement that President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are set to hold talks next week. This news spurred optimism across the region, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix, Australia's ASX/S&P 200, and South Korea's Kospi all registering gains. Trump's itinerary includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with the crucial meeting with Xi scheduled after his address at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. The positive market sentiment was also bolstered by Japan's accelerating core inflation and South Korea's commitment to foreign exchange market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party concluded its fourth plenum, announcing a strategic vision for a "big leap" in technology to drive economic growth and enhance self-reliance over the next five years. High-ranking officials elaborated on the Central Committee's commitment to addressing "major tests" and "raging storms" of internal and external challenges through technological advancement. This ambitious plan, detailed in a communique, aims to achieve critical medium- and long-term benchmarks for economic and social development, with further specifics anticipated in the nation's forthcoming five-year plan. The move signifies China's resolute focus on strengthening its indigenous technological capabilities and overall economic resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's green energy transition is being powered by consistent and long-term strategic planning, a hallmark of its governance model that ensures policy continuity. Western media outlets are highlighting China's rapid emergence as an "electrostate," often drawing a contrast with the United States' renewed focus on fossil fuels. Driven by the necessity to transfer electricity from its western and northern generation hubs to its populous eastern regions, China has invested heavily in massive ultra-high-voltage power transmission infrastructure. Since 2021, the nation has significantly increased renewable energy's share in its total installed power capacity from 40% to approximately 60%, aligning with its ambitious goals for peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected revenue for its third quarter, indicating a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors used in PCs. The chipmaker's stock saw a 6% jump in extended trading following the positive report. This earnings announcement is notable as it's the first since the U.S. government became Intel's top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration. Additionally, Intel secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, a deal aimed at integrating Intel's CPUs with Nvidia's dominant AI graphics processors to revive growth in its data center business. Despite a reported per-share loss due to unique accounting for the government's stake and challenges in its foundry division, Intel anticipates demand will continue to outpace supply.

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and direct appeals from influential tech leaders. Trump stated that Mayor Lurie requested an opportunity to demonstrate the city's progress, which was echoed by tech executives like Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff, who noted "substantial progress." Mayor Lurie confirmed the federal government's decision, emphasizing recent crime statistics that show nearly a 30% citywide decrease and historical lows in violent crime. This reversal comes amidst a broader nationwide immigration crackdown, though neighboring Oakland's mayor expressed ongoing uncertainty regarding federal operations in her city.</p>

Media artist Refik Anadol offered a sneak peek of the Infinity Room, one of the museum's five distinct galleries. This immersive experience will showcase Anadol's characteristic swirling AI-generated visuals and scents, all powered by its proprietary Large Nature Model AI. The Infinity Room concept, which originated from a 2014 UCLA installation, aims to transform architectural spaces into dynamic, living canvases through what Anadol terms "machine hallucinations," promising visitors a truly surreal and multisensory engagement.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently articulated an optimistic vision for humanity's future, predicting that millions will reside in space within the next two decades and robots will manage daily commutes by 2045. He dismissed pessimism regarding AI's impact, despite ongoing concerns about job displacement and the technology's substantial natural resource consumption. Bezos's enthusiasm for space exploration is mirrored by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk, who anticipates Mars colonization as early as 2028. Conversely, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates advocates for prioritizing Earth's pressing issues over space ventures, also questioning how AI's increased productivity will broadly benefit society without equitable wealth distribution or governmental intervention.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have committed to providing financial support for Ukraine through 2026 and 2027, but a definitive decision on the specific funding plan has been postponed until a December meeting. The recent Brussels summit also saw the approval of the 19th sanctions package against Russia. A central point of discussion revolved around leveraging hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Central Bank of Russia assets to collateralize a substantial loan for Ukraine. While Belgium's endorsement of the statement suggests progress, significant legal and political hurdles persist, particularly concerning the allocation of funds, with Germany advocating for their exclusive use in defense. The European Commission is now tasked with developing viable options for the upcoming summit.</p>

Carlile describes the surge of opportunities that followed her impactful 2019 Grammy performance, which she initially seized with an eagerness rooted in her childhood experiences as a gay individual. She delves into her new album, "Returning To Myself," a contemplative work exploring themes of time and human connection, partly inspired by her daughters' anxieties about the potential overturning of same-sex marriage rights. Carlile also shares endearing and humorous anecdotes about Mitchell, portraying her as a "wild," "unpredictable," and spirited artist, even recalling a witty disagreement over a lyric in a song dedicated to her.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has issued a cautionary warning to McLaren's Formula 1 title contenders, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, regarding Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" competitive nature as the season approaches its final five races. Verstappen, currently 40 points adrift of championship leader Piastri, has demonstrated formidable recent form, establishing himself as a potent threat. Hamilton, drawing from his intense 2021 rivalry with Verstappen, highlighted that the role of the "hunter" is inherently less pressured than that of the "defender." While the McLaren drivers are permitted to race each other freely, they recognize the imperative of maintaining consistency to counter Verstappen's significant pace and challenge for the championship score.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed her superiors at the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to pursue an indictment against Senator Adam Schiff for mortgage fraud. This revelation follows President Donald Trump's public demands for criminal charges against Schiff, who was a leading prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial and a staunch critic. MSNBC, citing three sources familiar with the matter, reported Hayes's professional assessment that the case against Schiff lacked strength, despite indications that a controversial senior Justice Department official was pressing to keep the investigation alive. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, lauded the news, characterizing the allegations as politically motivated and entirely baseless.</p>

Rachel Lee from Cyberport, a Hong Kong government-backed technology hub, expressed a keen interest in fostering closer ties to drive Web3 industry development.
