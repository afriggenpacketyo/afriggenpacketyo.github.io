          <p>South Korea and Japan are implementing measures to restrict foreign investment in residential properties due to concerns about affordability for local residents. These actions follow similar moves by other countries like Canada, Singapore, and Australia, which have also introduced policies to deter foreign buyers. In South Korea, foreign buyers now require local government approval before purchasing property in Seoul, a city known for speculative demand. These measures reflect a growing trend among Asian economies to address housing affordability issues by targeting sources of speculative demand, particularly from overseas investors. </p>

The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong experienced significant gains, led by companies like Alibaba Group, while mainland China's CSI 300 showed more modest increases. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi index faced declines, influenced by losses in semiconductor stocks. Investors are also closely monitoring developments in India-China relations, particularly after leaders from both nations emphasized their partnership during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting.

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a 3% increase after the company revealed trial data suggesting that its drug, Wegovy, demonstrates superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to competitors. The study indicated that Wegovy users had a significantly greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those using tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's rival drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro. This news comes as Denmark recently lowered its annual economic growth forecast, partly due to Novo Nordisk's declining U.S. market share and expectations of reduced exports. Despite this, European stock markets showed overall gains, with the Stoxx 600 index trading higher. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores potential tactical formations Liverpool could employ following the signings of Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, two elite forwards. Several options are considered, including a squeezed 4-2-3-1 formation, a 3-5-2 partnership reminiscent of Ekitike's time at Frankfurt, and a more fragile 4-2-4 approach. The article also suggests that Ekitike could adapt into a hybrid eight/10 position, similar to how Pep Guardiola uses aggressive midfielders. Ultimately, the author argues that Liverpool will likely rotate their frontline regularly to keep players fresh and adapt to different opponents, meaning there isn't necessarily one fixed starting XI. </p>

          <p>The final phase of an expansion of publicly funded childcare support has begun in England, providing more working parents with assistance for nursery costs. Eligible parents can now access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time for children aged nine months to four years, paid for by the government. However, parents report facing long waiting lists due to staff shortages limiting availability at nurseries. The government estimates that 70,000 extra places are needed, and while the number of spaces is rising, availability varies across the country, causing some parents to adjust their work schedules to match childcare availability. </p>

          <p>ScotRail has eliminated peak rail fares, allowing passengers to travel during busy weekday rush hours without paying higher prices. This initiative aims to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, making fares more straightforward and flexible. A previous pilot scheme that scrapped peak-time fares showed limited success in increasing passenger levels but required significant subsidies. The decision to permanently remove peak fares is intended to save passengers money and reduce carbon emissions, with savings of up to 50% on some routes. </p>
