          <p>Paris Saint-Germain won its first Champions League title, defeating Inter Milan 5-0, marking a significant achievement for Qatari Sports Investments, which has owned the club since 2011. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi celebrated the victory as vindication of their long-term project, overcoming past disappointments and player departures. The win took place in Munich, with Qatar Airways advertising prominently displayed, a controversial relationship due to human rights concerns. Despite fan protests against Qatari ownership, PSG fans largely embraced the success, focusing on the team's performance and the influx of talent, highlighting the blend of big-money signings and homegrown players.</p>

          <p>Kesha replaced the AI-generated cover art for her single "Delusional" with a photograph of herself after facing backlash from fans. The original cover, featuring AI-created imagery, was intended to highlight the undervaluation of artists, but Kesha decided to prioritize her integrity over making a political statement. The new cover features Kesha zip-tied to a chair, photographed by Brendan Walter, and credits her entire human creative team. "Delusional" is the second single from her upcoming album "Period," marking her first release under her independent label after parting ways with RCA and Kemosabe Records.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes came into effect across the UK on Sunday, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops can no longer stock disposable vapes but can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, and retailers violating the ban face fines. Disposable vapes have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping, contributing to environmental waste with millions of vapes discarded annually. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping.</p>

          <p>The new Champions League format, featuring a league phase, has been lauded as a success, with former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha highlighting its benefits. The single-match format in the league stage reduced pressure on teams and allowed for more surprising results, such as Aston Villa's win against Bayern Munich. PSG's journey to the title, overcoming early losses to secure a playoff spot, demonstrated that finding form at the right time is crucial. Journalist Nicky Bandini noted that the new format allowed for real-time observation of PSG's development throughout the season.</p>
