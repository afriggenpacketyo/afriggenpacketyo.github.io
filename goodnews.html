          <p>Tom Brady recently shared his thoughts on former coach Bill Belichick's move to college football as the new head coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Brady lauded Belichick's unparalleled work ethic and preparation, asserting that any player under his guidance will be exceptionally well-prepared for a professional career in the NFL. However, Brady also hypothesized that Belichick might face a learning curve in coaching younger, less-developed 17 or 18-year-old athletes, which presents a different challenge than coaching experienced NFL players.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis explores the potential motivations behind the Trump administration's decision to grant China a 90-day tariff truce while imposing steeper penalties on other nations like India. The article suggests that China's strategic leverage, particularly its dominance in rare earth minerals essential for US industries, played a key role. Additionally, the move avoids a tariff spike during the crucial holiday retail season and allows more time for broader trade negotiations, reflecting a complex geopolitical calculation by the White House to manage economic pressures.

          <p>This article challenges the prevalent nostalgia for the 1990s by presenting data that suggests life is better today in several key areas. It points out that the violent crime rate in the US is less than half of its 1991 peak, and global extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 40% to just 8.5%. Furthermore, the piece highlights monumental progress in public health, such as the transformation of HIV from a death sentence to a manageable condition, alongside a dramatic increase in social tolerance and educational attainment over the past three decades.</p>

          <p>Swiss sneaker company On delivered a strong second-quarter performance, with sales rising 32% and beating Wall Street expectations. As a result, the popular sportswear brand has raised its full-year revenue and gross margin guidance for 2025. This positive outlook comes despite the company facing new tariffs on its products sourced from Vietnam, as strong consumer demand, particularly in the Americas and China, has not slowed down even after the company implemented price increases to offset the higher costs.

          <p>An article details a financial planning strategy that could allow a retired couple to generate an annual income of $100,000 while paying zero in federal income taxes. The approach relies on carefully structuring income from a mix of sources, including Social Security benefits, qualified dividends, and long-term capital gains. These income types are subject to preferential tax rates, including a 0% rate for many filers below certain income thresholds. The article cautions that the strategy is subject to caveats like state taxes and future Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In its first quarterly report as a public company, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a 53% jump in revenue to $658.1 million, driven by powerful growth in its USDC stablecoin. The circulation of USDC grew 90% from the previous year, signaling surging interest from major financial institutions, which has been bolstered by more supportive crypto legislation. Despite a net loss due to one-time IPO-related charges, the strong revenue growth caused Circle's shares to rise over 7% in premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fueled by a campaign of generous subsidies, Alibaba's on-demand delivery service, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken its rival Meituan in daily orders. This strategic maneuver highlights the continued effectiveness of subsidies in China's highly competitive market and signals a shift from Meituan's near-monopoly toward a duopoly. According to Morgan Stanley, this trend is likely to continue, with analysts projecting that Alibaba and Meituan could command nearly equal shares of the instant commerce industry by the year 2030.

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation of tariffs. Under the extension, the US will maintain its 30% levy on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The White House stated the pause will provide more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and national security issues.
