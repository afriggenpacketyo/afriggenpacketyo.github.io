          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is leaving his White House post, with President Trump planning to nominate him as the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor. The decision to nominate Waltz to the U.N. ambassador role was made on Thursday morning. Waltz faced scrutiny in March after mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat discussing plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The appointment of Rubio as interim national security advisor was unexpected, even by some senior advisors at the State Department and the White House.</p>

          <p>Amid declining birth rates, more couples are choosing to be child-free, citing reasons ranging from high costs and climate change fears to prioritizing careers and personal relationships. While the Trump administration has proposed a "baby bonus" to encourage child rearing, many young couples remain steadfast in their decision not to have children. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that child-free individuals often value their relationships with their partners and don't want children to change that dynamic. Some individuals in their 30s have expressed some concern that their holidays will be less fun as they age without children, but they remain confident in their decision.</p>

PayPal, Venmo's parent company, reported strong quarterly earnings and maintained its forecast for the year, while Block, Cash App's parent company, saw its stock plummet after missing revenue targets and issuing disappointing guidance. Venmo's revenue jumped 20% in the first quarter, driven by increased adoption of features like the Venmo debit card and instant transfers.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the US will be manufactured in India, while iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will primarily originate from Vietnam. This strategic shift aims to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs imposed by President Trump on its supply chains, especially concerning goods from China. Despite this move, China will remain the primary manufacturing hub for Apple products sold outside the United States. Apple's sales in China fell 2.3% to $16 billion in the March quarter, facing strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi.</p>

          <p>May Day rallies across the United States drew large crowds focused on immigration, education, and workers' rights, with many demonstrations fueled by anti-Trump sentiment. Protesters denounced the administration's efforts to roll back workers' rights, cut education funding, and carry out mass deportations. Demonstrators also expressed anger about the perceived "threat to democracy" posed by President Trump. Rallies took place in major cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, as well as in smaller communities that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. A separate effort, the National Law Day of Action, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court to push for judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz, California, has implemented a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the ban was signed into law in 2018. Proponents of the tax framed it as a battle between Santa Cruz and the American Beverage Assn., arguing that big industry should not dictate local policy. Opponents argue the tax unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has shifted, with his frustration now directed towards Vladimir Putin rather than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite initial skepticism towards U.S. support for Ukraine and a disastrous meeting with Zelensky, Trump has recently engaged in diplomacy with Putin, drafting a peace plan that offered major concessions to Moscow. However, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands in the separate talks to settle the war. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions, noting Trump's zigzagging approach and conflicting views among his advisors.</p>

          <p>Detailed Army plans for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday in June call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands, and possibly a couple thousand civilians, according to the Associated Press. The planning documents are dated April 29 and 30 and have not been publicly released. High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.</p>

The Prince Albert of Monaco and Princess Stephanie presented the award to the trapeze artists. "The Controversial Caballero Brothers", are trapeze artists between the ages of 14 and 22.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's Worldcoin venture, which aims to create a global identity verification system using iris scans, is officially launching in the US with six retail locations. The project scans people's irises to create unique "IrisCodes," verifying that they are human and haven't signed up before, in exchange for cryptocurrency. Worldcoin is partnering with Visa to introduce the "World Visa card" and with Match Group to pilot World ID and age verification tools on Tinder in Japan. Some governments have questioned Worldcoin's mission, and Hong Kong regulators asked the project to cease operation of all data collection last year.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully continued to be at a historically low level in April, three full months into President Trump's aggressive efforts to curtail illegal immigration. In April, Border Patrol agents recorded roughly 8,400 apprehensions of migrants who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization. Trump administration officials argue that the president's far-reaching immigration crackdown is driving the dramatic drop in illegal entries. Critics have denounced Mr. Trump's immigration policies as draconian and inhumane, arguing they have trampled on migrants' due process rights.</p>

          <h2>Lynx Could Be First UK Zoo-Born Cat Freed Into the Wild</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 19:03:33 EDT</div>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. The female lynx was moved to Germany's Black Forest where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.</p>
