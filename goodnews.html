Furthermore, PepsiCo's business is diversified into salty snacks and packaged foods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime during school breaks to combat children's screen time. The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that outdoor play in England has declined significantly due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, which would include updating planning policies and protecting playtime in schools. Some councils have already begun removing these signs amid concerns about children exercising less.</p>
