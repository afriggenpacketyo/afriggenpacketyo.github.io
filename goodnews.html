          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed approximately 150 miles off the South Carolina coast, leading to tropical storm warnings for the region. With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the storm is moving slowly and is expected to make landfall over the weekend. Forecasters anticipate some further strengthening before it reaches the coast, bringing heavy rainfall of two to four inches, potential flash flooding, and high rip currents. The National Weather Service has issued warnings from the South Santee River, SC, to Cape Fear, NC, as emergency services prepare for the impact.</p>

          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill delivered a masterful performance, scoring 161 runs to follow his first-innings 269, setting his team up for a likely victory against England. After India declared at 427-6, setting a near-impossible target of 608, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the end of day four. Gill became the first player in Test history to score over 250 and 150 in the same match. With India heavily favored to win on the final day and level the series, England faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or playing for a draw.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix with a last-minute lap, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, followed by Mercedes' George Russell, making for a tightly contested qualifying session at Silverstone. Verstappen noted the windy conditions made the high-speed corners challenging, but his final lap was sufficient to top the session. The result sets up an exciting race, with McLaren showing strong pace and both Mercedes and Ferrari drivers close behind.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of a citizen. He emphasized that the nation was born from a bloody and divisive civil war between patriots and loyalists, a complexity that he believes makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that understanding the deep flaws of the founders, such as owning enslaved people while writing of liberty, does not diminish their achievements but makes them more real and their lessons more accessible. He advocates for embracing this complicated history to better understand present-day divisions.</p>

          <p>AI cloud provider CoreWeave has become the first company to deploy Nvidia's highly anticipated GB300 NVL72, a powerful liquid-cooled, rack-scale system for training advanced AI models. The move is seen as a major step for CoreWeave in the competitive AI infrastructure race, causing its stock to jump 9%. The new system, built with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, is reportedly ten times faster in responsiveness than its predecessor, making it a game-changer for developing multi-trillion parameter models. The deployment signals that Nvidia's next-generation ecosystem is now operational in real-world applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Amazon (AMZN) stock, with 47 out of 54 analysts rating it a "Strong Buy." This optimism is partly fueled by the company's continued investment and expansion into autonomous vehicle technology, specifically its Zoox robotaxi service. The consensus price target for AMZN stock is $244.41, implying potential upside, while the most optimistic target reaches $305, suggesting a possible 31% gain over the next year.

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her decision to raise her two children as a single parent, a choice relationship experts are praising as a sign of strength and self-awareness. Theron explained that she recognized she was not in a place to have children with another person, citing her family's history with alcoholism and her own tendency to lose herself in relationships. Experts note that her decision reflects a modern reality where partnership is a preference rather than a necessity for women. They see her choice as an act of alignment with her true self and a way to avoid repeating unhealthy cycles.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the "toughest group of all" for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Group D also features football powerhouses France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams are ranked in the world's top 11. Defending champions England and 2017 winners the Netherlands both have strong tournament records, while France is on an eight-game winning streak. As debutants and the lowest-ranked team, Wales enters as the clear underdog but hopes to leverage that status to its advantage in what promises to be a highly competitive group stage.</p>

          <p>A beverage known as the "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The alcohol-free drink typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no scientific studies to support the idea that this combination of ingredients can reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most people and can aid hydration, doctors note it's not a medical solution for stress and that managing stress through proven methods like sleep, exercise, and therapy is more effective.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the "MingKwai" typewriter was an ingenious solution to typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. The machine's system, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is now seen as a foundational concept that underlies modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery of the only prototype is being celebrated by scholars as finding a crucial missing link in the history of technology.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change negative public perceptions of the animals. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks, examines their stomach contents to assess their diet and health, and then releases them. This research provides vital data on the local ecosystem, as the health of these apex predators is a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean. Despite public fascination with sharks, researchers say securing financial support for this crucial conservation work remains a challenge.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researcher and former Google X executive Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that it takes about 90 seconds for the hormones associated with a stress response, like cortisol and adrenaline, to be flushed from the body. After this initial period, any lingering anger is a result of consciously or unconsciously rerunning the negative thought in your mind. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose how to react, rather than remaining stuck in an emotional loop, leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, a business school professor undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies in one year, from pottery to pickleball. The experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by connecting with new communities, and redefine her concept of self-care. She found that actively engaging in hobbies, rather than waiting for work-life balance to appear, was the secret to creating it. The author now advocates for pursuing hobbies as a primary path to happiness, confidence, and establishing healthy personal boundaries.</p>
