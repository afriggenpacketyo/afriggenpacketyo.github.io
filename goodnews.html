          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has won the 2025 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby, becoming the first catcher and switch-hitter to ever win the competition. He defeated Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round with a score of 18 to 15. Raleigh, who entered the All-Star break leading the majors with 38 home runs, secured his first-round spot on a narrow tiebreaker. The event, held at Truist Park, also featured a 513-foot home run by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest of the night.</p>

          <p>China's economy demonstrated stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter, with the gross domestic product expanding by 5.2%, surpassing the government's annual target. This performance, reported by the National Bureau of Statistics, has eased pressure on policymakers to introduce further economic stimulus. However, the growth rate marked a slowdown from the first quarter's 5.4%, and other indicators like retail sales and real estate investment showed signs of weakness. Despite the positive headline figure, economists remain cautious about future headwinds and insufficient domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to resume selling its H20 artificial intelligence chips to customers in China, stating it has received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development follows a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing and increased lobbying efforts by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued that such restrictions harm American tech leadership. The company also announced a new "fully compliant" GPU for industrial applications.</p>

          <p>A multinational crew of four astronauts, led by retired NASA veteran Peggy Whitson, has departed the International Space Station to begin their journey back to Earth. The team, part of a mission organized by private company Axiom Space, undocked their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule after an 18-day stay conducting research. The crew includes astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking the first time in over 40 years their respective government space programs have sent astronauts on a human spaceflight mission. The capsule is expected to splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast on Tuesday morning.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the United States. The administrative stay was granted following an emergency motion by the immigration advocacy group Casa, which is challenging the administration's decision to end protections for both Afghans and Cameroonians. The Department of Homeland Security had argued in April that conditions in these countries no longer warranted the special status. This ruling provides a brief reprieve for Afghans who faced the loss of their legal protection.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was only intended to apply within the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental third-party beneficiary. This response makes it less likely the high court will agree to review her conviction.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to ever finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the world's toughest foot race. The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley in extreme summer heat, with significant elevation changes. Becker completed the course with about three hours to spare before the 48-hour cutoff, successfully settling a score after falling just short of finishing in 2022. He credits his dedicated crew and coaches for his success, proving that age is not a limiting factor in endurance sports.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers as importers raced to get goods into the country ahead of potential new tariffs on Chinese products. Port officials described the 8% year-over-year increase as a "tariff whipsaw effect," rather than a sign of organic economic growth. The surge was fueled by businesses trying to beat an August 12 deadline for trade negotiations with China. Executives anticipate that shipping volume will likely ease significantly in the coming months if new tariffs are implemented, creating more uncertainty for supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Biobank project, the world's largest and most ambitious human imaging study, has reached its milestone of scanning its 100,000th volunteer. The 11-year initiative collects detailed MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound scans of participants' brains, hearts, and other organs to create a massive database for medical research. By combining this imaging data with genetic and lifestyle information from half a million volunteers, scientists aim to identify early markers of diseases like cancer and dementia. The anonymized data is made available to researchers globally to accelerate the prevention and treatment of common health conditions.</p>

          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has forcefully reaffirmed his country's diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic alliance based on shared democratic values. Speaking at a business forum, Peña stated that Paraguay would "stand firmly by Taiwan" and defend the 68-year partnership "with all its strength." The declaration comes amid ongoing pressure from Beijing for countries to switch their recognition from Taipei to mainland China. Paraguay remains one of the few countries, and the only one in South America, that maintains full diplomatic relations with the self-ruled island of Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rebounded on Monday after a sharp decline late last week. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase planned to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information, raising concerns about fintech business models. However, several financial analysts have since downplayed the threat, with firms like Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley describing the potential cost increases as "negligible" for major players. The rally was also supported by broader market momentum, including a record close for the Nasdaq and a rise in cryptocurrency prices. (not investment advice)</p>
