          <p>The Trump administration is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council, according to sources, weeks after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. The changes involve reassigning some staff within the administration and placing others on administrative leave. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser Andy Baker is taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. Some former members expressed concern that fewer people would mean less control, while others pointed to the NSC's track record as strained. The restructuring comes after recent staff firings and a perception that Waltz didn't vet staff enough.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to human influence by evolving changes in their beak size and shape due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, and males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbird range has also expanded northward, following the increasing popularity of bird feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. This demonstrates how quickly evolution can occur in response to human activities.</p>

          <p>A French court has found eight people guilty in connection with the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian, in which $10 million worth of jewelry was stolen. Seven of the convicted received prison sentences, while another received a fine, and two were acquitted. Kardashian testified that she feared for her life during the ordeal. She has forgiven the ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, who had asked for forgiveness. The thieves were dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their ages.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an apparent agreement for a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. This development reverses the Biden administration's block on national security grounds. The terms of the deal were not included in Trump's statement, and it remains unclear whether U.S. Steel will remain American-owned and operated. The United Steelworkers union remains opposed, citing concerns about job security under Nippon Steel.</p>

          <p>King Charles is undertaking a significant visit to Canada, signaling support for the country amidst pressure from US President Donald Trump. As the first monarch to open Canada's Parliament in almost 70 years, King Charles's speech, crafted with Canadian government input, is expected to affirm Canadian sovereignty. The visit follows an election victory for Prime Minister Mark Carney, fueled by anti-Trump sentiment. The King's role balances solidarity with Canada and maintaining the UK's relationship with the US.</p>
