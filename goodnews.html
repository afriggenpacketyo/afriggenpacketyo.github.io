          <p>Juventus secured a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Club World Cup Group G match, with Kenan Yildiz scoring twice. Juventus took an early lead, with Yildiz playing a key role in the opener and later scoring a spectacular goal. Despite a goal from Wydad, Juventus extended their lead through Yildiz and a late penalty from Du≈°an Vlahoviƒá, eliminating Wydad from the competition. Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fails to beat Manchester City. The comprehensive win for Juventus results in a high optimism score.</p>

          <p>Local Iranians in Los Angeles are finding solace in Persian restaurants and neighborhoods, such as Tehrangeles, amidst escalating conflict. Restaurants like Azizam are hosting complimentary tea and backgammon to provide a safe space for Iranians to relax and connect with their culture. While many Iranian Americans fear for their families in Iran, they hope to bridge the divide between the two countries. Despite divisions within the Persian diaspora, these spaces offer much-needed support and a sense of community during a time of crisis. The sense of community and support raises the optimism score.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously high temperatures as a rare June heatwave continues. Heat advisories are in effect from Minnesota to Maine, with heat indices expected to reach over 100¬∞F in many areas. Cities are opening cooling centers and taking precautions to protect residents from heat-related illnesses. Meteorologists attribute the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity. The severity of the heatwave and potential for health risks lead to a moderate optimism score.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough by dismissing Sai Sudharsan, checking India's progress after Harry Brook's impressive 99 at Headingley. India, who had earlier bowled England out for 465, holds a narrow lead of 96 runs at the close of play. Brook's innings was marked by outrageous strokes, but he fell just short of a century. The match is finely poised, with both teams having opportunities to seize control. The competitive nature of the game results in a moderate optimism score.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East have ended mostly higher after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict with Tehran would help bring it to an end. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's benchmark EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher. The positive market reaction results in a higher optimism score, but the potential for continued conflict keeps it from being too high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarus' opposition leader, has called on President Trump to help free all political prisoners in Belarus. Tikhanovsky was recently released and reunited with his wife after five years in solitary confinement. He described his harsh treatment in prison and called for the freedom of over 1,000 political prisoners still behind bars. He urged Trump to use his power to secure their release. The release of Tikhanovsky and other prisoners is a positive step, but the ongoing plight of others keeps the optimism score moderate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships has identified five phrases that trigger defiance in children and suggests alternative language to foster cooperation. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." The article recommends replacing these phrases with more respectful and empathetic language that honors a child's autonomy while setting boundaries. The goal is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural and children feel respected and emotionally safe. The article's focus on positive parenting techniques results in a high optimism score.</p>

The Suns will receive Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 pick in this year's draft, and five second-round picks in return for Durant. The trade is expected to be completed when the new league year starts on July 6. Durant, a 15-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion, averaged 26.6 points for the Suns last season. The trade could benefit both teams as the Rockets would add a star player and the Suns would acquire several assets. The potential for improvement for both teams results in a high optimism score.</p>

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be excluded from the alliance's 5% defense spending target. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that a 5% spending would be disproportionate and unnecessary for Spain. Spain will meet its commitments to NATO by spending only 2.1% of its GDP. The 32 NATO countries had agreed on a statement for the upcoming summit, setting a goal of 5% of GDP for annual defense spending by 2035, but Spain secured an exemption. Spain's ability to meet its obligations with lower spending leads to a moderate optimism score. (not investment advice)</p>

The pilot program will involve a small number of cars operating in a "geofenced area." Invited riders will use the Robotaxi App to hail the self-driving cars and provide feedback. The launch comes amid scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups, but Tesla has emphasized its commitment to safety. The launch of the robotaxi service has the potential to boost Tesla's fortunes. The potential for innovation is high, but the safety concerns result in a moderate optimism score.</p>

          <p>NATO members have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, but Spain secured an exemption from the measure. Spain argued that the 5% figure was unreasonable and counterproductive. All other member nations will have until 2035 to reach the goal of 5%. The agreement calls for at least 3.5% of national GDP to be spent on core military needs, with an additional 1.5% allocated for related expenditures. Spain's ability to secure an exemption and maintain its own spending levels leads to a moderate optimism score. (not investment advice)</p>
