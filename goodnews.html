          <p>On the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, former President Trump announced a proposal to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits for most seniors. The plan is part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and is being touted as the largest tax break for seniors in U.S. history. The administration also highlighted improvements to the Social Security Administration, such as reduced customer service wait times and efforts to combat fraud, countering Democratic criticism that his policies would harm the program. This article details the administration's claims of strengthening the vital safety net for nearly 72 million Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man accused in the 2008 murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy Juan Abel Escalante has been extradited from Mexico to face charges in the United States. Roberto Salazar, 38, was arrested by Mexican authorities in March and was one of 26 prisoners transferred to U.S. custody this week. Escalante was shot and killed outside his parents' home while preparing to go to work, in what authorities believe was a case of mistaken identity by gang members. Salazar faces charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy, which carry a sentence of life without parole.</p>

          <p>Following the $8 billion takeover by Skydance Media and RedBird Capital, new Paramount chief David Ellison has outlined a vision to revitalize the company by doubling down on major franchises like “Top Gun,” “Star Trek,” and “Yellowstone.” The new leadership plans to nearly double the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies and aims to make Paramount a top destination for talent. Ellison emphasized a goal of creating entertainment for a broad audience and moving the company away from political divisions. The strategy also includes significant new content deals, such as a $7.7 billion agreement for UFC streaming rights on Paramount+. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Los Angeles successfully contained a one-acre brush fire in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze, fanned by light winds, burned for approximately 40 minutes before being extinguished, with no immediate threat to homes or evacuations required. Air support, including water-dropping helicopters, was used to control the fire in the dense, dry brush. One firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion during the response, and crews remained on scene to manage any remaining hotspots while the cause is under investigation.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars and its parent company to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate them to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move effectively strips Alex Jones of control over his brand, studio, and property, paving the way for their sale. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction that this will finally lead to accountability for Jones's harassment. The decision shifts the fight from federal bankruptcy court to state court, where a sale of the Infowars brand, potentially to satirical site The Onion, is now more likely.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatments for ADHD can provide significant wider life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, which analyzed over 148,000 people in Sweden, found that taking ADHD medication was associated with notable reductions in the risk of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal activity. Researchers believe this is because the medication helps reduce impulsivity and improves concentration. These findings provide stronger evidence for the long-term benefits of treatment and could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about starting medication.</p>

Companies like HD Hyundai are shifting operations to countries with lower labor costs, such as the Philippines, where it plans to invest $550 million to revive a shipyard and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts suggest this strategy helps South Korean shipbuilders overcome domestic constraints like labor shortages and union tensions. While building a skilled workforce in new locations will take time, the move is seen as a viable long-term solution to strengthen their global market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the payment app Zelle, alleging its failure to implement adequate security safeguards allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from consumers. The lawsuit claims that EWS knew from its launch that Zelle's design, including a quick registration process and lack of verification, made it highly susceptible to fraud. The suit seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers and a court order requiring the company to improve its anti-fraud measures. A Zelle spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt" and a "copycat" of a previously dismissed case.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain in a penalty shootout after a dramatic late collapse, squandering a 2-0 lead in the final five minutes of the match.

The team demonstrated efficiency and danger from set-pieces, scoring both of its goals from dead-ball situations. While the inability to close out the game highlights areas for improvement, the overall display against the European champions suggests a solid foundation for the upcoming season.</p>

These journalists and specialists build trust through direct engagement but struggle to compete with viral falsehoods.

          <p>The announcement of a presidential summit between the U.S. and Russia in Alaska has brought renewed attention to the history of the territory's acquisition. In 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million, a deal that was initially criticized as "Seward's Folly" but later proved to be a strategic and resource-rich acquisition. This article notes that even today, some in Russia question the legitimacy of the sale and view the land as historically Russian.

The Mendenhall River crested at unprecedented levels after a nearby glacier-dammed lake released a massive surge of water, a phenomenon intensifying due to climate change. While some minor flooding occurred, the fortified walls, made of giant reinforced sandbags, held back the worst of the water and prevented the widespread destruction of homes seen in previous years. Officials expressed relief that the proactive measures worked as intended, avoiding a major disaster for the community.</p>

The surge is largely attributed to the team's relocation to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium by owner Stan Kroenke.
