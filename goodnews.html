          <p>Japan's current account surplus hit a record 30.38 trillion yen in fiscal year 2024, marking the second consecutive year of growth, driven by significant returns on foreign investments. The Finance Ministry reported a 16.1 percent increase from the previous year, reaching the highest level since comparable data became available in fiscal 1985. Other news includes China and the U.S. agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism amid tariff disputes, and the WTO head is set to meet with Japanese officials to discuss global trade concerns.

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns following ministerial-level talks in Geneva. This agreement, the first formal encounter since tariffs escalated in April, aims to provide political relief for both powers without appearing weak. The article notes that the US is under pressure to show wins, while China views negotiations as a strategic process for managing bilateral competition and economic resilience.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports that the Trump administration may accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical concerns, highlighting the long history of U.S. presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers. The U.S. Constitution bans government office holders from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval, as outlined in the emoluments clause. Gifts valued over $480 are considered property of the United States and are managed by the White House Gift Unit, often transferred to the National Archives or presidential libraries. The article notes that foreign leaders use gifts to strengthen relationships, but ethical concerns persist regarding potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have announced a trade deal following productive talks in Geneva, although details remain scarce and a joint statement is expected on Monday. The agreement aims to ease tensions that arose after President Trump imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures. While U.S. officials have described the talks as a breakthrough, Chinese officials have been more reserved, framing their involvement as a necessary step to avoid further escalation and protect the global economy. Financial markets have responded positively, but some analysts warn of potential disappointment if tariffs are not significantly reduced.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands, UK, for the first time in about 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies, as elk are considered a "keystone" species that can enhance biodiversity. Challenges include gaining public acceptance and assessing disease risks to livestock. The successful reintroduction of beavers serves as a potential model for the project, which would initially involve keeping elk in enclosures before potentially releasing them into wetland habitats.</p>

After being stolen, South Korean authorities arrested the thieves, but Buseoksa Temple claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.
