          <h2>'South Park' Secures $1.5 Billion Deal to Move to Paramount+</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:14:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-running animated series "South Park" is moving from HBO Max to Paramount+ after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone finalized a new five-year, $1.5 billion deal. This agreement will bring all previous seasons and 50 new episodes to the Paramount+ streaming service, following a competitive bidding war among major platforms. The move comes as Paramount faces criticism for cancelling "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," a decision the company states was purely financial. The deal ensures new "South Park" episodes will first air on Comedy Central before becoming available for streaming.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic expedition, signaling renewed scientific cooperation with potential geopolitical implications. The 45-day mission aboard a Russian research vessel will survey the Bering Sea and northwestern Pacific Ocean to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments. The research will focus on sediment processes and the region's climate history over the last 126,000 years. This resumption of joint missions is framed as a shared commitment to addressing climate change but is also seen in the context of both nations' growing ambitions in the Arctic.</p>

          <h2>MLS All-Star Game Sparks Debate on Format and Relevance Amid Lionel Messi's Absence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:52:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, entertained fans but also highlighted growing questions about its purpose and format. The event's relevance was underscored by the conspicuous absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, who skipped the festivities, potentially facing a suspension for his next club match. While the game serves as a mid-season business and cultural fixture for the league, Messi's no-show suggests top players may prioritize competitive matches over exhibitions. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to rethink the event to maintain player engagement and boost viewership.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's decision. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the policy, which aimed to deny citizenship to many individuals born on U.S. soil, a principle enshrined in the 14th Amendment. The order, signed shortly after Trump took office, has faced numerous legal challenges and injunctions nationwide. This ruling marks another significant legal defeat for the administration's effort to repeal a long-standing constitutional right, pushing the contentious issue further along the path to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Is a More Realistic and Effective Health Target</h2>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day, rather than the commonly cited 10,000, is sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of serious health issues like heart disease, cancer, and dementia. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign and lacks a firm scientific basis. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits at the 7,000-step level compared to lower activity. They argue that adopting a more achievable step count could encourage more people to track their activity and improve their overall health.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in the area. These pelagic snails are known for their striking purple shells and the bubble rafts they create to float on the open ocean surface. Their appearance in Southern California often coincides with warmer offshore waters, and the discovery has sparked speculation about its connection to climate change. Researchers are urging the public to report any further sightings as they study whether the continued presence of these snails could be an indicator of changing ocean conditions.</p>

          <p>South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge was driven by robust and sustained demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company's revenue rose over 35% year-on-year, and it expects strong demand to continue for the rest of 2025. This success has positioned SK Hynix as a leader in the advanced memory market, challenging its main rival, Samsung Electronics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn, newly acquired San Francisco Giants player Rafael Devers made his debut at first base and stated he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This marks a significant shift from his time with the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field helps keep him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The change comes after a tense spring with his former team, where management and Devers were reportedly at odds over his role on the field.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, beating expectations and allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest turnaround, economists remain cautious, suggesting the pace of growth is unlikely to last. The ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. remain a significant source of uncertainty for the export-reliant economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews have made significant progress against the Euclid fire, which broke out Wednesday afternoon in Chino Hills, San Bernardino County. The vegetation fire, located near the 71 Freeway and Euclid Avenue, quickly grew to 120 acres, forcing the temporary closure of the freeway in both directions as the blaze jumped across it. By early evening, firefighters successfully stopped the fire's forward rate of spread and established a dozer line to clear vegetation. The freeway has since reopened, and crews achieved 5% containment, with mop-up operations continuing through the night.</p>
