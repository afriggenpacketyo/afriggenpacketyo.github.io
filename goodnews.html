          <p>Generative AI models from Google and OpenAI achieved gold-level scores for the first time at the International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious competition for young mathematicians. While five human contestants still attained perfect scores, Google's Gemini chatbot and OpenAI's experimental reasoning model each impressively solved enough problems to earn 35 out of 42 points, a gold medal equivalent. This marks a significant leap in AI's mathematical reasoning, with Google's model solving problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, a substantial improvement from the previous year. The rapid advancement suggests AI could reach human-level cognitive abilities within a decade, prompting discussions on its exponential progress.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child was attacked by a mountain lion while hiking with family on Hurricane Ridge in Washington state's Olympic National Park. The child's father is being hailed as a hero for his swift intervention, pulling the child from the creature's jaws and likely saving their life. Emergency crews airlifted the injured child to a Seattle trauma center, and the child has since been discharged in satisfactory condition. Following the incident, park rangers tracked and euthanized the collared cougar responsible. While harrowing, mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare in North America, with only two fatalities in Washington state over the past century.</p>

          <p>This article highlights two inspiring stories of individuals finding purpose through helping others. Brian Flynn became a rare double organ donor, giving a kidney to a stranger and part of his liver to a four-year-old, transforming his mid-life crisis into a profound mission. Separately, Rachel Bee, a teenager diagnosed with Crohn's disease, invented "Infusion Hero," a specialized sweatshirt with a zippered sleeve, to help patients stay warm and comfortable during long infusion treatments. Both individuals demonstrate how personal challenges and a desire to contribute can lead to extraordinary acts of generosity and innovative solutions, creating significant positive impact for others.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's surged over 30% in volatile trading, reminiscent of recent meme stock rallies. The stock more than doubled at one point before paring gains, with trading halted multiple times. Despite no apparent corporate announcements, Kohl's exhibits characteristics of a meme stock, including high short interest (around 50% of shares) and retail investor attention on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. When investors flock to heavily shorted stocks, it can trigger short squeezes as short sellers buy to cover losses, driving prices higher. The company's underlying business, however, continues to struggle with falling sales and leadership changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding Credit Card Grace Periods and Late Payment Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the concept of credit card grace periods, explaining that most cards offer a grace period on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if the full balance is paid by the due date. However, it emphasizes that there is generally no mandated grace period for late payments; once the due date passes, late fees, penalty APRs, and credit score damage can occur. The article advises contacting the credit card company immediately if a payment will be missed, making a partial payment if possible, and setting up automatic payments to prevent the issue in the future. It also suggests exploring debt relief options for consistent payment struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, affirming its full-year guidance despite a $1.1 billion impact from President Donald Trump's auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the automaker is working to "greatly reduce its tariff exposure" through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The company anticipates a total tariff hit of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year, with the second half more exposed. GM's North America margin decreased significantly, but the company is making progress on mitigating costs. While EV sales were 46,300 for the quarter, GM expects slower demand after tax credit expirations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Harvard University study, published in Science Advances, suggests that the odds of having all boys or all girls are not a straight 50/50 chance. Analyzing 58,007 women's birthing records, researchers found that families with at least three children tend to follow a "weighted coin toss," indicating a distinct tendency toward one gender. For instance, if the first two children are girls, the probability of the third also being a girl is higher, a pattern continuing with subsequent births. While the exact mechanism is uncertain, the study points to factors like maternal age at first birth potentially influencing these sex clustering patterns within families.</p>

With dating apps, social media, and informational sites becoming inundated with AI output, distinguishing real from fake is becoming harder. The author suggests this degradation could push people to seek out real-world interactions and physical media, leading to a "log off" movement.

          <p>A 57-year-old early retiree's celebration with friends took a sour turn when he disclosed his $2.3 million 401(k) and pension. Instead of congratulations, some friends, who earned more throughout their careers but saved less, reacted with resentment, repeating, "It's not fair." The incident sparked a discussion on Reddit's FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) community, with many advising against sharing personal net worth due to potential envy. Commenters noted that people often fail to see the sacrifices made for financial discipline, focusing only on the outcome. The consensus was to practice "stealth wealth" and celebrate quietly to avoid negative social reactions. (not investment advice)</p>
