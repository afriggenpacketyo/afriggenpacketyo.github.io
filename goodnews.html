          <p>Miley Cyrus's new album, Something Beautiful, is described as too "good" to be pop, laden with signifiers of quality that undermine the genre's focus on pleasure. The album features contributions from indie musicians and is marketed as an opus, but its ambition results in a sense of heaviness. In contrast, Addison Rae's debut album, Addison, is praised for its blend of electronic experimentalism and pop sensibilities, evoking artists like Aphex Twin and Madonna. Rae's album is seen as a throwback to a time when pop didn't insist on its own importance, highlighting the craftsmanship required to create a hit. Rae's approach is refreshing. </p>

          <p>Sly Stone, who passed away at the age of 82, is remembered for his transcendent pop-funk, harmonizing energies that were tearing America apart in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His band, the Family Stone, offered a vision of racial and emotional integration. Key songs like "Stand!" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" showcased his ability to blend celebration with darker lyrical themes. Stone's later album, There's a Riot Goin' On, reflected a descent into drug use and isolation, connecting him to present-day struggles. His music remains relevant. </p>

          <p>CD interest rates are currently elevated, offering an opportunity to earn higher returns than the inflation rate, with leading accounts providing better returns than the current inflation rate. National averages for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CD yields are 2.00%, 1.70%, and 1.71% APY, respectively, but some institutions offer rates exceeding 4.00%. Online banks often provide more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs may offer higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Strategies like laddering CDs can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>
