          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes mandatory genetic sex testing. World Boxing is introducing mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers in their competitions. The decision to mandate testing came after controversy surrounding Khelif's gold medal win at the Paris Olympics, fueled by claims from the International Boxing Association that Khelif and another boxer failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women's competition at last year's world championships. The organization said athletes need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will travel to Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss the war in Ukraine, trade tensions, and bilateral relations. This will be the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Merz took office on May 6. Germany has a strong interest in defusing trade tensions between the European Union and the United States. Trump had previously threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods imported from the EU but delayed the deadline to July 9.</p>

          <p>British rider Simon Yates delivered a stunning performance on the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia, overtaking Isaac del Toro to secure his second Grand Tour title. Yates attacked on the Colle delle Finestre, leaving his rivals behind and establishing a significant lead. His Visma-Lease a Bike team executed a strategic plan, allowing Yates to capitalize on team-mate Wout van Aert's presence in the breakaway group. This victory marks Yates as the third British rider to win the Giro, following Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart, demonstrating his perseverance after facing setbacks in previous years.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile week, influenced by President Trump's comments on trade with China and key earnings reports. The S&P 500 closed flat on Friday but gained for the week and month, driven by a rally earlier in the week after Trump delayed tariffs on the European Union. Nvidia's strong earnings and guidance boosted its stock, while Salesforce faced criticism despite positive results. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, though concerns about future tariff impacts remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal health officials have revised COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, stating the vaccine is not recommended for healthy children or pregnant women. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that decisions about COVID vaccination for healthy children should come from shared clinical decision-making. The CDC now says it has "no guidance" on whether pregnant women should get the COVID-19 vaccine. Some doctors criticize the changes, saying there is no new evidence to support removing the recommendation that healthy pregnant women and healthy children should get the COVID vaccine, causing confusion for patients, providers, and payers.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple parenting rules to help navigate the complexities of modern parenting. The rules emphasize following instincts, culture, and the individual child, rather than relying on influencers or clickbait. The advice focuses on prioritizing enjoyment over strict development and being authentic rather than striving for an ideal self. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their own judgment and cultural traditions while also recognizing the unique needs and interests of their children.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris in Barcelona. Piastri's advantage suggests that a rule change aimed at restricting the flexing of front wings for aerodynamic gain has had little effect on McLaren. The gap between pole and Verstappen was bigger than at Imola, where the Dutchman won, and in Japan and Saudi Arabia, where he was on pole. Piastri said the rule change had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.</p>

          <p>Ukraine requires more than just military aid; it urgently needs financial resources, particularly the ‚Ç¨300bn of frozen Russian assets held in European accounts. Handing these assets to Ukraine would be a significant blow to Putin, bolstering Ukraine's morale and financial stability. While some fear that confiscating the funds would undermine Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, the situation with Russia is an extreme case that should not deter decisive action. Seizing these assets would demonstrate a unified front against Russian aggression and provide much-needed support to Ukraine in its fight for survival.</p>

The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and enjoyed views from the spacecraft's large windows. The New Shepard booster returned to a landing pad near the launch site, while the crew capsule parachuted back to Earth after a 10-minute flight. Blue Origin has now launched 68 passengers on these sub-orbital flights, and since its competitor Virgin Galactic retired its original rocketplane, Blue Origin has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself.</p>
