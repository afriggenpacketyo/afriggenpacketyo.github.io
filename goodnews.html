          <p>A McDonald's secret menu item called the "Cotton Candy Sprite" has gained popularity on social media, involving ordering a medium Sprite with three pumps of French vanilla syrup. The drink, only available for in-person orders, has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising its flavor and others expressing skepticism or disappointment. This isn't the first time a McDonald's secret menu hack has gone viral, as the "Land, Air & Sea" sandwich previously gained traction. While McDonald's has not officially embraced the Cotton Candy Sprite, its viral status indicates the power of social media in influencing consumer trends and creating buzz around fast-food offerings.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging Anthony Davis' Pulitzer Prize-winning opera, "The Central Park Five," which tells the story of five Black and brown teenagers wrongly convicted in the 1989 sexual assault case in Central Park. The opera also features Donald Trump, who, at the time, took out newspaper ads demanding the death penalty for the accused. The director, Nataki Garrett, emphasizes that the production focuses on the lives and perseverance of the wrongly accused men rather than sensationalizing Trump's role, aiming to expose the truth and connect with deeper humanity.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a National Warrior Independence Center in West Los Angeles, aiming to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In California's "salad bowl," some farmers are investing in housing for H-2A guest workers due to labor shortages and increased immigration enforcement. These modern housing complexes aim to address the affordable housing crisis exacerbated by growers buying up local homes and motels. While some community members are skeptical, citing the needs of domestic farmworkers, county leaders see it as a win-win. With the Trump administration's focus on deportations, growers are seeking legal avenues to stabilize their labor supply, but concerns remain about potential exploitation within the H-2A program.</p>

          <p>The remote town of Bolinas, California, is celebrating the upcoming reopening of its post office after being without one for over two years due to a dispute between the U.S. Postal Service and the landlord. Residents creatively campaigned for its return, picketing, marching, and writing poems. The reopening is seen as a major victory, especially given concerns about the potential privatization of the Postal Service. The post office is set to reopen in the fall of 2025, restoring a vital community hub and service for the town's residents.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is expanding, adding three new locations in California‚ÄîIndio, Modesto, and Monrovia‚Äîto its list of 2025 openings, alongside a Sylmar site and locations in Arizona, Colorado, and Washington. The expansion targets areas with high population growth, both inland in California and out-of-state. Analysts suggest that opening locations outside California prevents cannibalization of existing stores and capitalizes on market opportunities presented by domestic migration. The company is also consolidating its corporate offices back to Baldwin Park, where it first opened.</p>

He points to the success of pitchers like Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine, who focused on movement and control rather than maximum effort.</p>
