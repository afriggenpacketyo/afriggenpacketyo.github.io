          <p>Starbucks is piloting a new protein cold foam at five locations across the U.S., aiming to tap into the growing popularity of protein-enhanced beverages. The banana-flavored foam is being tested with the chain's iced latte. This move is part of Starbucks' broader strategy to reimagine its menu and boost sales, which have remained relatively flat. The company plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025 to streamline operations and enhance the customer experience.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal has been reached with China, subject to final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, where China will supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US will walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. The agreement follows two days of talks in London aimed at resolving trade conflicts between the two countries. Details of the agreement are limited, but officials say it will not alter the broad outlines of the May truce, which lowered but did not eliminate new tariffs. The US has agreed to remove some "counter-measures," though specifics were not provided.</p>

          <p>This article explains how to estimate monthly annuity payouts, emphasizing that the payments depend on factors like investment amount, age, annuity type, and interest rates. It provides formulas for estimating payouts from fixed immediate annuities, both with a simplified version and a rule-of-thumb multiplier for lifetime annuities. The article stresses that real payouts depend on more than just the investment amount, and it advises requesting quotes from multiple insurers before making a decision. It also notes that the gender of the investor may influence the payout amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some parents are adding their young children, even toddlers, as authorized users on their credit cards in an effort to help them establish credit early. A survey from LendingTree indicates that about one in four parents have authorized a child under 18 on their credit or debit card. Financial advisors say it's never too early to start building credit, as a good credit score can lead to better rates on mortgages, car loans, and even employment opportunities. Parents are advised to pay their bills in full and on time and monitor for unapproved purchases.</p>

The official change will be announced in October by the Social Security Administration, and the estimate is subject to change based on future data. The COLA may increase further if President Trump's tariff policies prompt higher inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
