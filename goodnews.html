        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, has announced that energy bills will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This translates to an annual saving of ¬£129 for a typical household using gas and electricity. While charities welcome this reduction, they emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, collectively owing suppliers about ¬£4 billion. The price cap, which is updated every three months, sets the maximum suppliers can charge per unit, impacting 21 million households, though prices remain significantly higher than earlier in the decade.</p>
