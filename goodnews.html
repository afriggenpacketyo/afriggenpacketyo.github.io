        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has announced the removal of many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, effective September 1st, signaling a significant step towards improving strained trade relations. These counter-tariffs, initially set at 25% on CA$30 billion worth of U.S. goods, were a response to the U.S. imposing 25% duties on steel and aluminum. While specific tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place for now, Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized Canada's focus on strategic sectors and its belief in having the best trade deal with the U.S. This development, following a "productive" phone call between Carney and President Donald Trump, aims to kickstart negotiations as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement nears its review, with the White House calling the move "long overdue."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 12:50:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a notably dovish speech at Jackson Hole, signaling that interest rate cuts are likely in the near future. He cited rising downside risks to employment and suggested that the inflationary impact of elevated tariffs would be a temporary, rather than spiraling, concern. The market responded with a significant rally, particularly benefiting cyclical stocks in sectors like consumer discretionary, real estate, industrials, and materials, which thrive on increased economic activity spurred by lower borrowing costs. This shift has boosted investor confidence for at least two, and potentially three, rate cuts this year, with a September reduction now seen as highly probable. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain a reliable and secure option for savers, currently offering competitive interest rates around the 4% range, which surpasses traditional savings accounts. A $10,000 deposit can yield substantial earnings, such as approximately $107.50 over three months at 4.30% APY or around $2,100 over five years at 4.20% APY. These accounts provide guaranteed returns and FDIC insurance up to $250,000, locking in rates for the entire term. The choice of CD term should align with an individual's liquidity needs and financial goals, as longer terms often offer enhanced yields and the benefits of compounding interest, providing peace of mind in a stable, low-risk investment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divers have successfully retrieved remarkable 2,000-year-old artifacts, including statues, Roman coins, and limestone structures, from a sunken city in Abu Qir Bay, off Egypt's coast. Authorities believe this site is an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a prominent center during the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Roman Empire, which was submerged over centuries by earthquakes and rising sea levels. Notable finds include statues of royal figures, sphinxes (one with Ramses II's cartouche), a merchant ship, and stone anchors, offering invaluable insights into ancient history. This significant archaeological discovery unfolds as modern Alexandria faces similar threats from climate change and rising sea levels, highlighting historical parallels and contemporary environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>The 2025 summer box office is projected to reach at least $3.75 billion, marking a 2% increase from the previous year, buoyed by unexpected hits like Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" ($421 million domestically) and "Superman" ($340 million). Despite hopes within Hollywood for a return to the pre-pandemic $4 billion standard, many major franchise titles underperformed. While movie theater operators reported solid audience numbers and ticket sales for the second quarter, analysts predict a significant cooldown in ticket sales through August and October. The industry anticipates a strong rebound in late November with highly anticipated releases such as "Wicked: For Good" and "Zootopia 2," expected to exceed $100 million openings and bolster year-end figures.

          <p>Ether, a leading cryptocurrency, surged significantly, trading near its record highs, in response to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments at Jackson Hole. Powell's remarks, suggesting that economic conditions might warrant adjusting policy to cut rates, caught many traders off guard, leading to substantial short liquidations in Ether as positions were closed. This "panicked repositioning" in the market, coupled with increased confidence in easing monetary policy and perceived alignment between the administration and the Fed, propelled the cryptocurrency's price higher. Shares of companies focused on accumulating Ether also bounced, reflecting renewed momentum for risk-on assets in the crypto space, though Ether ETFs experienced a week of net outflows.

          <p>Extreme heat disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly people of color and low-income residents, a disparity linked to decades of discriminatory housing policies like redlining. Environmental justice advocates emphasize the urgent need for more green spaces, such as parks and expanded tree canopies, as a crucial solution to combat record temperatures. Studies demonstrate that trees can significantly lower local temperatures and improve air quality, directly benefiting these vulnerable neighborhoods. Initiatives in cities like Phoenix and New York are actively working to increase urban forestry and create community gardens, providing not only essential cooling relief and shade but also fostering community well-being and addressing deep-seated climate inequities.</p>

He cherishes the creative freedom that comes with being a "legacy band," no longer striving for big radio hits but creating music for himself and his dedicated fanbase. The band's continued success, evidenced by sold-out tours, underscores their enduring appeal, with Rzeznik still embracing experimentation and the joy of musical discovery after nearly 40 years.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Kyiv, urging "robust security guarantees" for Ukraine to prevent future Russian aggression, with the United States expected to be "clearly" involved in any such agreement. This diplomatic push comes amidst President Trump's efforts to broker a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though Russia's foreign minister stated no such meeting is currently planned due to an unprepared agenda. Separately, the European Union disbursed €4 billion in aid to Ukraine after Kyiv withdrew a law restricting anti-corruption bodies, underscoring the critical importance of corruption reforms and rule of law for Ukraine's future path towards EU membership.

The show continues to humorously contrast Bobby's evolving values and open-mindedness with his father Hank's more traditional views, while showcasing Bobby's inherent sweetness and willingness to embrace new experiences.

These tools, such as the Skylight Calendar and Maple app, aim to streamline tasks like meal planning, chores, and scheduling, primarily addressing the burden disproportionately carried by mothers. While experts concede that these apps are merely "Band-Aids" for larger societal and policy challenges like high childcare costs and lack of paid family leave, they can offer some practical relief for overwhelmed parents. This rapidly growing sector, valued at nearly $650 billion, seeks to make family management more efficient, though privacy concerns and the potential for creating new forms of labor remain valid considerations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent speech, hinting at potential interest rate cuts, offers significant good news for homeowners hoping to refinance high-rate mortgages. Mortgage rates typically track 10-year Treasury yields, which are sensitive to Fed monetary policy decisions and broader economic changes. Experts suggest that if the Fed proceeds with rate cuts, potentially in September, it could lead to lower borrowing costs, benefiting both prospective homebuyers and those seeking to refinance existing loans. Homeowners are advised to proactively prepare for these opportunities by reviewing credit reports, maintaining strong credit scores, estimating home equity, and gathering essential documents to enable swift action when favorable rates emerge.

Notable busts included the dismantling of 25 cryptocurrency mining centers in Angola, where equipment worth $37 million was seized, and an inheritance scam in Ivory Coast that defrauded victims of $1.6 million. With cybercrime now accounting for over 30% of all reported crime in West and East Africa, this coordinated international effort represents a significant step in combating sophisticated transnational criminal networks and enhancing regional security.</p>
