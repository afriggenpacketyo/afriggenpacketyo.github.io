          <p>South Sudanese models are increasingly prominent in the fashion industry, known for their striking features and resilience. Models from South Sudan, or its diaspora, are featured in magazines and on runways, with many attributing their success to their "perfect, dark skin" and height. However, some face challenges, including exploitation by agencies and family perceptions of modeling as a career. Despite these obstacles, South Sudanese models are making a mark, driven by increasing demand for diversity in fashion and a desire to represent their young country on the global stage. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A columnist argues that democracy is weakened by low voter turnout, particularly in local elections. In San Antonio, the mayoral race saw a turnout of barely 10%, raising concerns about public engagement in governance. The lack of participation contrasts with the efforts to promote democracy abroad, highlighting the need to make voting easier and more appealing. The influence of outside groups in local elections and the disconnect between voters and their representatives further exacerbate the problem. The article emphasizes that democracy requires active participation and engagement from citizens to remain healthy and strong. </p>

Some areas could receive more rain on Saturday than in the entire month of May, following a record-breaking dry spring. While the storms are expected to ease off in the west by mid-afternoon, showers are likely in other parts of the UK, with Sunday promising brighter conditions but still a risk of thunderstorms. </p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's recent fallout with President Trump, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is continuing its efforts to transform government. With members embedded in multiple agencies, the team's approach to streamlining processes and cutting costs is becoming "institutionalized," according to one official. This suggests that the DOGE's influence may extend beyond Musk's direct involvement, potentially reshaping government operations in the long term. The focus remains on efficiency and cost-cutting measures across various agencies. </p>

Executive orders signed by President Trump have limited the rights of trans people, and corporate sponsors have declined to support the event due to policies targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives.
