          <p>Defense Secretary John Healey anticipates UK defense spending will increase to 3% of GDP by 2034, aligning with Prime Minister Starmer's plans announced in February. The government is set to release its strategic defense review, outlining priorities for military and security spending in the coming years, emphasizing the rapidly changing global threat landscape. The review will also recommend deploying digital experts alongside troops to counter enemy drones and manage future unmanned weapons, with over ¬£1 billion invested in developing technology to expedite battlefield decisions. Funding for defense will partially come from reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scammers who falsely claim that artificial intelligence can predict questions for the upcoming national college entrance examination (gaokao). The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly launched a campaign to investigate and eliminate ‚Äúillegal and harmful information‚Äù related to the exams. With over 13.3 million people taking the test this year, there is a high demand for mock papers, with some sellers falsely claiming AI can predict actual questions, leading to inflated prices. The authorities are also investigating social media accounts and tutors alleging access to ‚Äútop secret‚Äù information from teachers involved in setting the exam papers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice hitting store shelves, drawing consumers seeking relief from soaring prices. Major retailers like Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama began selling the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out in just 30 minutes, while long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. This initiative aims to curb rising rice prices by selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel Corp. as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, supporting the Japanese company's $14 billion investment in the American producer. Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain under American control. He also announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent, citing national security concerns. Nippon Steel's proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel had faced scrutiny, with then-President Biden previously blocking the sale on national security grounds, although Trump has given the deal his blessing contingent upon the steel company remaining American controlled.</p>
