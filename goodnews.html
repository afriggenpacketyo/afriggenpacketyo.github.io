The Kyoto-based gaming giant anticipates selling 15 million units globally in the current business year, fueled by significant preorder interest with 2.2 million Japanese applicants vying for a unit via lottery. The console features include screen sharing, voice chat, a larger screen with twice the pixel count, and 4K output, with a new Mario Kart installment released alongside it. The company expects a substantial sales increase for fiscal 2025 due to the Switch 2's popularity.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this summer to discuss trade, as countries navigate the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

Engagement with China remains a priority for Albanese, especially after his Labor Party's recent election victory.

          <p>UK newspapers lead with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected reversal on winter fuel payment cuts, with potential plans to recoup the payment from wealthier pensioners through higher taxes. Concerns arise about potential chaos in recovering payments from bereaved families of deceased pensioners. Immigration policies also take center stage, with contrasting approaches from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. Other headlines include warnings about weight-loss jabs, Trump's fiscal policies, and an increase in free school meals. The newspapers also highlight Ed Miliband's success in protecting net-zero schemes from budget cuts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thin Blue Paw, a charity supporting serving and retired police dogs, is advocating for pensions to assist with the often complicated and costly medical needs of these animals. Each year, 50 to 70 police dogs retire and are often adopted by members of the public or their former handlers, but their care can involve significant expenses. The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of ¬£3,000 more annually compared to a regular dog, due to specialized diets, joint support, and hydrotherapy. Some police forces, like Nottinghamshire Police, already provide pensions for retiring dogs, but the Home Office currently has no plans to change the national retirement process.</p>

          <p>The increasing adoption of decentralized solar power has prompted a Pakistani think tank to advocate for China's leading role in Pakistan's energy transition, potentially creating a model for other Global South countries. Cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants in Pakistan, leading to stranded assets. The report suggests China should support a unified clean energy vision in Pakistan, fostering a co-creation of a home-grown clean-energy innovation ecosystem. However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is financially viable.</p>

Millions are in limbo due to clerical errors and insufficient income, and a "yes" vote would recognize the dignity and diversity of these individuals.
