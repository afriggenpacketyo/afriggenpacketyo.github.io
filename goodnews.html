          <p>NATO allies have convened in The Hague for a two-day summit to discuss increasing defense spending amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Leaders from the 32 member states, along with representatives from Indo-Pacific partners, are expected to address both crises during the session. A key demand from US President Donald Trump is getting NATO members to commit to increasing defense spending to 5%, which is likely to be a central point of discussion at the summit, which is taking place in the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intervention in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may be yielding positive results with a ceasefire agreement in place, although its stability remains uncertain. While Iran agreed to halt strikes against Israel, Israel agreed to stop striking Iran after achieving its objectives. However, the fragility of the agreement was highlighted by accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides shortly after its supposed implementation. The success of this ceasefire could mark a significant step back from a wider regional conflict.</p>

Morgan adjusted her CV to be more AI-friendly, leading to more assessment invitations and eventually a job offer. Despite the challenges, Caitlin is set to begin her career in London, highlighting the competitive nature of the graduate job market.</p>

          <p>Oil prices have declined following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alleviating concerns about potential supply disruptions in the Middle East. The Ice Brent contract fell by 2.41% to $69.76 per barrel, while the front-month August Nymex WTI contract decreased by 2.42% to $66.85 per barrel. Investors had been worried about the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a critical route for oil shipments, but the ceasefire has eased these fears. However, analysts note that the situation remains volatile and the potential for renewed conflict could still impact oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering mandating changes to Google's search services to promote greater competition. The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes if a firm holds excessive power in a market. Potential changes include "choice" screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. The CMA aims to ensure fair competition in online search, where Google currently holds a dominant market share.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II and foster political integration on the continent. The organization acts as a collective security alliance, providing mutual defense if a member state is threatened by an external country, as outlined in Article 5 of the charter. The alliance has expanded to 32 members, including former Warsaw Pact countries, and continues to adapt to evolving security challenges. Russia's war against Ukraine has underscored NATO's strategic relevance and purpose.</p>

          <h2>Japan Rice Price Falls Below 4,000 Yen for First Time Since March (not investment advice)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 02:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms for the first time since March, reaching 3,920 yen. The decrease is attributed to increased distribution of stockpiles, which has helped drive down prices. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries reported the price drop, noting that it is the first time in over three months that the average price has fallen to this level. The lower rice prices could provide some relief to consumers facing inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Airlines May Face Less Disruption in Iran-Israel Conflict Compared to Western Rivals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 01:59:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Western airlines may face greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which forces carriers to avoid dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies can still use it, giving them a competitive advantage. The airspace closures by Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan have led to flight diversions and cancellations. Western airlines are diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, as well as southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia, while Chinese airlines have more flexibility.</p>
