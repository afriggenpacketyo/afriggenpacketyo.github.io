        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has developed a groundbreaking single-cell analysis tool called "Uni-C" that could revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of the disease. The technology analyzes circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood, which are shed from tumors but are extremely rare and difficult to study. Uni-C can decode multiple layers of genomic information from these cells in less than a day, offering insights for early screening, monitoring, and personalized treatment. This rapid blood test promises to match the accuracy of traditional biopsies, potentially saving lives through earlier diagnosis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by 0.3% between April and June, a figure that, while slower than the previous quarter's 0.7% expansion, exceeded economists' forecasts of 0.1%. The Office for National Statistics reported that growth was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors. The government hailed the figures as positive, though opposition parties criticized the slow pace of growth. Experts noted that the better-than-expected performance was partly due to upward revisions for previous months, but cautioned that global economic weakness and the impact of tax rises may hinder growth in the coming quarter.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer and a key Apple supplier, reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, beating market expectations. The strong performance was largely driven by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, which has become a key partner for chipmaker Nvidia. For the first time, revenue from server products surpassed that of consumer electronics, accounting for 41% of the total. The company anticipates its AI server business will continue to grow significantly, though it remains cautious about the potential impact of global political and economic conditions, including U.S. tariffs.</p>

It clarifies that BTecs are practical, vocational courses assessed through a mix of coursework, projects, and exams, offered at different levels equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels. The grading scale, from Pass to Starred Distinction, is outlined. The article also touches upon the recent government review of post-16 education, which has resulted in funding being secured for many BTec courses that were previously set to be scrapped in favor of new T-levels.</p>

          <h2>South Korea's Supreme Court Rules Against Copyright Claim for "Baby Shark"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court of South Korea has dismissed a copyright infringement lawsuit over the viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had claimed that the 2015 hit by The Pinkfong Company was a copy of his 2011 version. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The court found that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp chant that is considered to be in the public domain. Pinkfong's "Baby Shark" has become a global phenomenon, amassing over 16 billion views on YouTube.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity executive Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This figure marks the highest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, surpassing the $6.05 billion sale of the NFL's Washington Commanders in 2023. The new ownership group, which also includes local Boston businessmen, will acquire a controlling stake in the team. The sale follows a successful era under the previous ownership, led by Wyc Grousbeck, who bought the team for $360 million in 2002 and oversaw two NBA championships.</p>

          <h2>Startup Aims to Decarbonize US Freight Rail by Replacing Diesel with Battery Power</h2>

          <p>A startup named Voltify is aiming to transition the $80-billion U.S. freight railroad industry from diesel to battery power, a move that could significantly reduce carbon emissions. The company has developed "VoltCars," which are essentially large sodium-ion batteries on wheels designed to connect to existing locomotives. While facing skepticism from a traditional industry concerned about reliability and charging times, Voltify is developing forecasting algorithms and solar-powered microgrids to ensure consistent power. With major railroad companies spending over $11 billion annually on diesel, the switch to battery electricity could offer substantial long-term cost savings in addition to environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates a growing trend of "bleisure" travel, with 55% of business travelers admitting to having family or friends join them on work-related trips. The practice is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% having brought along partners, children, or friends. Motivations for this trend include combating loneliness on the road, reclaiming family time, and creating budget-friendly vacations by leveraging covered expenses like hotels. While many employees are discreet about these arrangements, some companies are embracing the practice as a way to boost morale and loyalty, provided that work responsibilities are met and expenses are clearly separated.</p>

          <p>As Anchorage, Alaska, prepares to host a high-stakes summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, local residents are feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. While some enjoy the international spotlight on their city, many are wary of the meeting's potential outcomes, with satirical jokes like "please don’t sell us back" circulating. Alaskans have a unique perspective on Russia as a close, and at times hostile, neighbor whose jets probe their airspace. The summit has generated a "meme-rich environment" as locals use humor to cope with the "dystopian" scenario of hosting the two world leaders.</p>
