          <h2>New Womb Lining Test Offers Hope for Women with Recurrent Miscarriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 20:01:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have developed a test to identify women with abnormal womb linings, increasing their risk of miscarriage, potentially paving the way for new treatments. The study found that in some women with a history of miscarriage, the womb lining doesn't react correctly to support embryo implantation, leading to bleeding and early pregnancy loss. A new test measures signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining and is being piloted to help over 1,000 patients. Charlie Beattie, who had multiple miscarriages, participated in a trial, took sitagliptin, and successfully gave birth to a healthy baby after the test showed her womb was not hospitable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sabrina Carpenter released an alternative album cover for "Man‚Äôs Best Friend" after the original artwork sparked backlash for allegedly promoting sexist stereotypes. The initial cover featured Carpenter on all fours like a dog with a man pulling her hair, leading to accusations of setting women's rights back. The new black-and-white cover depicts Carpenter in an elegant gown leaning against a man in a suit, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe. This isn't the first time Carpenter has faced criticism, as she previously received backlash for filming a music video in a Catholic church and for suggestive performances during her tour.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CIA director stated that US strikes "severely damaged" Iran's nuclear facilities, setting them back years, contradicting a leaked Pentagon intelligence report that downplayed the impact of the raid. John Ratcliffe, the US spy agency's director, said key sites were destroyed, while President Trump maintained the raid had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities. Israel and Iran appeared to honor a fragile ceasefire negotiated by Trump after 12 days of war. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard supported Trump's assessment, stating that Iran would need years to rebuild the facilities. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi suggested Tehran may have moved highly enriched uranium elsewhere during the attack.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California drivers are likely to see a jump in gas prices in July due to a state sales tax increase and stricter regulations on refineries to promote lower-carbon fuels. The combined increases could raise gas prices by nearly 70 cents per gallon, although experts are hesitant to provide an exact estimate. In addition to the tax increase, amendments to the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard program are expected to add to the cost at the pump. The regulations aim to incentivize lower-carbon fuels and reduce fuel use by 2045, but the added cost of compliance will be passed on to consumers.</p>
