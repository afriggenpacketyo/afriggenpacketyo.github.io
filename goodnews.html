          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is a community coalition dedicated to uncovering and memorializing the history of racial lynchings in their region. The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and placing markers, the EKRP aims to confront a painful and often ignored part of local history. The project's work is seen by its members as especially vital amid current political efforts to downplay or erase difficult aspects of America's racial past.</p>

          <p>Throughout June, cities across the world have hosted Pride events, celebrating the LGBTQ community and highlighting the ongoing struggle for equal rights and inclusion. These celebrations trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that galvanized the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The article notes that Pride Month first received federal recognition in the U.S. in 1999 and continues to be marked by vibrant marches and festivals. The events serve as both a commemoration of historical progress and a powerful demonstration of the community's resilience and demands for full equality.</p>

          <p>A second summer heatwave is prompting heat health alerts across most of England, with temperatures forecast to climb into the 30s Celsius over the weekend and potentially reach a new yearly high of 34-35C on Monday. An amber alert, indicating a potential impact on the entire population and health services, is active for London and southern and eastern regions. The heatwave coincides with the Glastonbury Festival and the start of Wimbledon, which could see its hottest opening day on record. The UK Health Security Agency is advising caution, as sustained high temperatures can pose risks, especially for the elderly and vulnerable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and pressure from allies, Germany plans to dramatically increase its defense budget to build the largest conventional army in Europe. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that the government will now commit 3.5% of its GDP to defense, a substantial increase from its historical spending levels. This move involves a constitutional change to create a special $117 billion fund, allowing for massive investment in the armed forces without cutting social programs. The decision marks a historic change for a country with a post-WWII history of military reluctance, reflecting a new sense of urgency regarding European security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues that the spirit of the LGBTQ+ rights movement is rooted in diversity and progress, not in the "respectability politics" being promoted by some conservative gay figures. The author criticizes former ambassador Richard Grenell's attempts to separate "normal gays" from transgender issues, drawing a parallel to a scene in the 1999 film "Flawless." The piece asserts that the movement was historically led by its most marginalized members, such as drag queens and gender-nonconforming people at Stonewall. It concludes that attempts to appeal to the mainstream by silencing more flamboyant or radical elements betray the community's history and collective interest.</p>

          <p>Voters in Huntington Beach, California, a city known for its conservative politics, have decisively rejected two ballot measures pushed by the MAGA-aligned city council. The measures would have created a parent review board to censor children's books and allowed for the privatization of the city's library system. The victory for library advocates is being hailed as a significant grassroots success against far-right overreach, demonstrating that even in a Republican stronghold, there are limits to politically motivated attacks on public institutions. Organizers from the nonpartisan group Protect HB attribute their success to mobilizing a broad coalition of residents who felt the council had gone too far.</p>

Over 100 musicians, organized into nine ensembles, were spread throughout the 900-foot-long, art-free space, performing an expanded version of Washington's work "Harmony of Difference." The performance was a grand-scale celebration of the new building's potential for interdisciplinary art, with the music interacting with the unique acoustics and changing sunset light. The event echoed the museum's 1965 opening, which also featured a major musical premiere, signaling a continued commitment to performance art in the museum's new era.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas, including a 24-year-old female and her three offspring, have left a zoo in western Japan to return to China, significantly reducing the country's panda population. The departure from Adventure World in Wakayama Prefecture marks the end of a lease agreement, leaving just two pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo. The Wakayama zoo, which has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors. The event underscores the nature of China's "panda diplomacy," where the beloved animals are loaned to other nations for a set period.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on President Trump's recent public use of an expletive when expressing frustration over the Israel-Iran conflict. The author suggests that while it broke presidential norms, the moment came across as authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many, cutting through typical political spin. The article posits that the public is tired of overly polished and scripted political speech and that judicious, genuine use of strong language can make politicians seem more human and trustworthy. While not advocating for constant profanity, the author argues that in high-stakes situations, such language can be a powerful tool to capture attention and convey sincere emotion.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration faced a momentous week, securing several victories while key challenges remain unresolved. The White House celebrated a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions against its executive actions, as well as a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and increased NATO defense spending commitments. However, major domestic priorities hang in the balance. The president's sweeping tax and spending bill faces a difficult path in the Senate, and numerous trade deals remain in limbo ahead of a self-imposed July deadline.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing a barrage of increasingly sophisticated Russian drones, Ukraine is ramping up its use of unconventional air defense solutions, particularly interceptor drones. Russia has modernized its Shahed drones to fly higher and faster, making them difficult for mobile ground units to shoot down. In response, Ukraine is developing and deploying its own specialized, high-speed drones designed to pursue and destroy the incoming threats in the air. This strategy is seen as a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to using expensive anti-aircraft missiles, with Ukrainian officials and manufacturers working to mass-produce these systems to protect cities and critical infrastructure.</p>

The intelligence-led operation required officers to move 37 large containers to locate the hidden drugs.

These facilities will support innovation in fields such as AI model training, autonomous driving, and monitoring the plateau's delicate ecosystem.
