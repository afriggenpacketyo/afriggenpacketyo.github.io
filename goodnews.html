          <p>A significant security operation is in effect for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to Scotland, where he is staying at his Turnberry golf resort. The US president played a round of golf amid road closures and a heavy police presence, while several hundred demonstrators gathered in Aberdeen and Edinburgh to protest. Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss trade and international affairs. The visit has raised concerns over security costs and the impact on local police resources.</p>

          <p>So-called "laundrobars," which combine laundry facilities with food, drinks, and entertainment, are becoming more popular, turning a mundane chore into a social experience. While new locations in Brooklyn have recently gained media attention, similar establishments have existed for decades in cities like Reno, Nevada, and Portland, Oregon. Owners report that adding amenities like beer, coffee, and arcade games attracts more customers and creates a community hangout spot. These businesses often face high overhead costs but find success by creating a welcoming, café-like atmosphere and sometimes partnering with other local businesses to manage the food and beverage operations.</p>

          <p>A routine pre-surgery X-ray led to a terminal diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for Christopher Kennedy, a seemingly healthy 68-year-old. After medications failed and his lung function deteriorated, doctors gave him less than a year to live, but he was approved for a double-lung transplant at age 74. Despite initial hesitation and a challenging wait, Kennedy successfully underwent the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic and has since made a remarkable recovery. Now 75, with his lung capacity at 98%, he is training a new therapy dog named 'Encore' to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, veteran closer Kenley Jansen of the Anaheim Angels could potentially be traded, with his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, emerging as a possible match. Jansen, who is having one of his best seasons since 2021, is a pending free agent on a non-contending Angels team, making him a valuable trade asset. The Dodgers are in urgent need of right-handed relief pitchers due to injuries and bullpen overuse. While Jansen once hoped to play his entire career with the Dodgers, he has indicated he would be willing to pitch in any role for a contending team to pursue another World Series title.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Charging expenses to a rewards card and immediately paying the balance with savings can help couples earn points or miles for a honeymoon. However, with the average wedding cost expected to hit $36,000 in 2025, there is a significant risk of starting a marriage with high-interest debt. Experts caution against carrying a balance, recommending this approach only for those who can pay in full to avoid long-term financial stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The proposed Captive Primate Safety Act seeks to make private ownership and breeding of primates illegal across all 50 states, addressing a brutal industry fueled by social media trends. Animal welfare experts and zoo officials state that primates kept as pets suffer from chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage from being isolated from their own kind. The pet trade often begins with poachers killing adult monkeys to steal their babies, many of whom die during smuggling. This legislation, currently in a House committee, is seen by advocates as a key step in protecting primates both in captivity and in the wild.</p>

          <p>The US retailer Sam's Club, known in China for its curated selection of premium, imported goods, has sparked controversy among its members by stocking a low-priced, domestically made chocolate pie. Loyal customers, who pay an annual fee for access to what they see as a high-quality, global lifestyle, view the product as a betrayal of the brand's premium image. The incident has triggered concerns that the Walmart-owned retailer may be lowering its quality standards for suppliers. For many of its health-conscious, middle-class shoppers, the introduction of the common snack item has eroded their trust in the brand.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland this weekend in a critical effort to avoid a transatlantic trade war. The meeting aims to secure a framework trade agreement before a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU goods takes effect on August 1. There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could involve a 15% baseline tariff, similar to the recent U.S.-Japan agreement. Trump confirmed the meeting, stating there is a "good 50/50 chance" of making a deal to stabilize trade relations.</p>
