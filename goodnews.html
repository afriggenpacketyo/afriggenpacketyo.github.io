          <p>Brown University and the Trump administration have struck a deal to restore frozen federal research grants in exchange for several commitments from the university. Under the agreement, Brown will donate $50 million to local workforce development programs and adhere to new policies regarding women's sports, antisemitism, and admissions. In return, the government will unfreeze millions in Health and Human Services grants and close pending non-discrimination investigations.

          <p>Microsoft's market value exceeded $4 trillion in after-hours trading after the company announced better-than-expected quarterly results, making it the second company to reach this milestone alongside Nvidia. The software giant reported its fastest revenue growth in over three years, largely driven by its Azure cloud computing business, which saw sales grow by 34% to over $75 billion for the fiscal year. The strong performance highlights Microsoft's successful capitalization on the artificial intelligence boom, further solidifying its position as one of the world's most valuable companies.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, pointing to elevated uncertainty in the economic outlook and inflation remaining above its 2% target. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the economy remains in good shape and is not being unduly held back by current policy, despite facing pressure from President Trump to lower rates. The central bank will continue to monitor incoming data before its next meeting in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent trend in television, exemplified by shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," immerses viewers in high-stress, anxiety-inducing environments, yet audiences find it satisfying. This article explores the psychological reasons behind this phenomenon, suggesting that vicarious stress can be enjoyable as it provides a fight-or-flight response without any real-world risk. Experts note that these shows, often using hyperrealistic techniques like single-take sequences, create a strong sense of empathy and catharsis. The focus on mundane, relatable workplace pressures resonates with viewers who may be processing their own anxieties.</p>

This announcement coincides with Meta's strong financial performance, driven by its pivot to AI, with the company reporting a 36% increase in profit. Zuckerberg also emphasized the role of AI-integrated glasses as future primary computing devices, noting a significant jump in sales for the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p>

          <p>Figma, the collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, which is above its previously stated range of $30 to $32. The offering, which values the company at $19.3 billion, raised $1.2 billion, with the stock set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. This IPO comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory challenges. Figma's successful pricing indicates a potentially receptive market for tech IPOs, following other strong debuts this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's stock price climbed over 10% after the company posted second-quarter financial results that significantly beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings. The social media giant reported a 22% year-over-year increase in sales, driven by strong advertising revenue that CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed to AI-driven efficiencies. The company also issued a strong sales forecast for the third quarter and announced increased capital expenditures, partly due to a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup Scale AI, signaling a continued aggressive push into artificial intelligence.

          <p>Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California, ending months of speculation and opening up the race to lead the nation's most populous state. In her statement, the former vice president and 2024 presidential nominee said her public service would not be in elected office "for now," but did not rule out a future bid for the White House. Harris's decision had effectively frozen the gubernatorial field, and her absence now clears the way for a crowded field of Democratic candidates to compete for the position.</p>

          <p>This article highlights six independent Latin artists whose innovative work during the 2024-25 season deserves recognition from the Latin Grammy Awards, though they may be overlooked in favor of mainstream acts. The list includes Argentine experimentalist Juana Aguirre, Chilean singer-songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan-born cellist Mabe Fratti. Also featured are Venezuelan composer Cheo, Mexican dance-pop artist Girl Ultra, and Argentine rocker Marilina Bertoldi. The piece argues that their forward-thinking and critically acclaimed albums represent some of the most progressive music in the genre today.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza has released her Spanish-language version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," titled "El Pendón Estrellado," as a charity single. She gained national attention after performing the song at Dodger Stadium, reportedly against the wishes of a team representative, as a statement of support for immigrants. Half of the proceeds from the single will go to A Place Called Home, a South-Central Los Angeles youth organization, with the other half benefiting various immigrant rights groups. Nezza stated the release is a "profound statement of unity" and a tribute to the diverse voices that enrich America.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Kamala Harris's Decision to Forgo Governor's Race Keeps 2028 Presidential Option Open</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:19:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis suggests that by declining to run for California governor, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the possibility of a 2028 presidential campaign alive. Attempting to run the nation's most populous state while simultaneously pursuing the presidency would have been practically and politically difficult. While she would enter a 2028 race with high name recognition, she would also face a large field of Democratic challengers and carry the burden of the 2024 election loss. The decision avoids a gubernatorial run she reportedly had little appetite for and sets up a potential future primary contest with fellow Californian Gavin Newsom.</p>
