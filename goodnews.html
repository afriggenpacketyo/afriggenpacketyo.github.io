          <p>A federal judge in Boston extended legal relief to Harvard University in its fight against the Trump administration's effort to halt the entry of Harvard students coming in from overseas. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order until June 23, while she considers a longer-term injunction. The Trump administration cited the university's engagement with China and other national security concerns in its June 4 proclamation. Harvard argued that the proclamation was an "end run around" Burroughs' previous decision and violated the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares increased following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions such as relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters or transferring production outside the U.S. Trump has described the deal as a "partnership," while U.S. Steel confirmed it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.

          <p>This satirical piece, written as a diary entry from Donald Trump, humorously recounts his disappointment with his 79th birthday celebration. He expresses frustration that his tank parade was not grandiose enough, lacking the militaristic flair he desired. He contrasts his vision with the reality, lamenting the historical accuracy and lack of personal glorification in the event. The piece satirizes Trump's perceived ego and authoritarian tendencies. The piece is satirical and funny.</p>

          <p>All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler families over the opioid crisis. The settlement resolves litigation against Purdue Pharma, which, under the leadership of the Sackler families, invented, manufactured and aggressively marketed opioid products for decades, according to the lawsuits. The settlement will end the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and bar them from making, selling, or marketing opioids in the U.S. The funds will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs.
