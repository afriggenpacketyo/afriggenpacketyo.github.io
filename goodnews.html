          <p>Four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone significant transformation, though its path to success has been gradual. The club has modernized its training facilities, more than doubled its staff, and seen revenues projected to climb past £400 million. On the pitch, the team won its first major domestic trophy in 70 years and has qualified for the Champions League twice, despite a recent dip in form. However, the club's growth is constrained by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing it from leveraging its owners' full wealth and forcing a more strategic approach.</p>

          <p>Beijing is shifting its public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers to project a more favorable image of China. In a campaign targeting younger audiences, the Chinese embassy in Kenya funded a week-long tour for popular content creators to showcase the country's culture, scenery, and history. This move is seen by analysts as a "soft power" evolution, aiming to connect directly with African youth through cultural and tourism promotion. The strategy represents a departure from traditional state-led media approaches, leveraging the authenticity and reach of digital personalities to build goodwill.</p>

          <p>Music legend Lionel Richie has revealed in his new memoir, "Truly," that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before a fan's comment changed his career path. The 76-year-old artist described himself as a shy young man who saw the clergy as a potential vocation. However, during an early performance with The Commodores, a woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!," which gave him the validation he needed to pursue music. Richie credits that pivotal moment and his time with the band for helping him overcome his shyness and discover his identity as a singer and songwriter.</p>

          <h2>German Government Accelerates Integration of Artificial Intelligence into Public Services</h2>

          <p>The German government has launched a "Modernization Agenda" to significantly increase the use of artificial intelligence in public administration and services. The plan aims to reduce bureaucracy, expedite processes like visa applications, and create an AI avatar of a state minister to communicate in 100 languages. While officials argue that embracing AI is crucial for future growth and efficiency, some experts express concern about over-reliance on American tech and a lack of scientific guidance in policymaking. The push comes amid debate over whether the government is focusing too much on generative AI hype rather than more practical applications.</p>

          <p>Despite tensions arising from the Gaza war and U.S. scrutiny, China and Israel are attempting to revitalize their economic relationship. Driven by a mutual interest in technology and trade, Beijing's ambassador to Israel has been actively engaging with Israeli officials and visiting key joint infrastructure projects. These include the Tel Aviv light rail and a container terminal in Haifa, a project that has previously drawn security concerns from Washington. The diplomatic efforts aim to reinforce the comprehensive innovative partnership established between the two nations in 2017, underscoring economic priorities in their bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>The White House is sending senior envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to Egypt to help finalize a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The move comes after Hamas accepted key parts of a U.S.-led peace proposal and President Trump stated, "we are very close" to an agreement. The negotiations, set to begin Monday, will focus on the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a path to a lasting end to the conflict. Despite the diplomatic momentum, Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, killing scores of Palestinians and drawing condemnation from Hamas.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump nominee, ruled that the administration's justification for the deployment did not meet the high legal standard required to act without the governor's consent. In her decision, the judge stated that the protests in the city were "not significantly violent or disruptive" enough to warrant such a military intrusion into civil affairs. Oregon officials praised the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty and the rule of law.</p>
