          <p>China has approved the mass production of its domestically developed AG600, the world's largest amphibious aircraft, marking a significant advancement in the country's aviation industry. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the plane, confirming that the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) has established a reliable system for consistent and safe aircraft production. This approval is a milestone towards a more high-end and standardized civil aviation manufacturing sector, strengthening China's ability to independently build a complete civil aviation ecosystem. The AG600 is part of China's broader initiative to build a self-reliant civil aviation industry, particularly in light of recent US technology restrictions.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is positioning itself as a leader in the stablecoin market with the passage of comprehensive stablecoin laws, aiming to gain an edge over the US and Singapore. The new legislation reflects the city's determination to unlock value in the digital asset sector, addressing past industry setbacks. This move, combined with Hong Kong's vast offshore yuan holdings and China's restricted cryptocurrency use, fuels hopes that Hong Kong could secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market. The ordinance takes effect on August 1, giving the market a lead in Asia, with a friendlier regulatory stance than Singapore's framework introduced last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons studied belonged to a species that is now the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters during the Jurassic period to the formidable giants of the Cretaceous period. The new species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' powerful jaws and bite forces.</p>

Japan is one such partner actively negotiating with the Trump administration, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump scheduled to meet during a G7 summit in Canada.
