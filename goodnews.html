          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney has announced he will not support the assisted dying bill proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, which is scheduled for a vote on May 13. The bill would allow terminally ill individuals, deemed mentally fit by two doctors, to request medical assistance to end their lives. Swinney's opposition could influence undecided MSPs, particularly within his own party, as the Scottish Parliament prepares for its third vote on this issue, having previously rejected similar bills in 2010 and 2014. McArthur has adjusted the proposed legislation, raising the minimum age from 16 to 18, aligning it with laws in other countries, and urging MSPs to vote in favor of creating a compassionate and safe law for Scotland.</p>

Sapporo withdrew its bid for the 2030 Winter Games following scandals linked to the 2020 Tokyo Games. Bach emphasized the need for Japan to ensure such corruption is addressed and that Japanese business practices are clarified. Despite these issues, Bach acknowledged Japan's significant role in the Olympic movement, highlighting its success in hosting international tournaments and the achievements of its athletes at the Paris Games.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will give away virtually all of his wealth, estimated at $108 billion, over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's essay "The Gospel of Wealth." The Gates Foundation, originally planned to operate decades after his and Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045. Gates aims to focus on stopping preventable deaths of mothers and children, eradicating infectious diseases, and improving education, but is concerned about potential setbacks due to cuts in U.S. foreign aid. He expressed his determination to ensure the money is well spent during this final chapter of his career.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that deporting migrants to Libya without due process would violate a previous court order, following reports that the White House considered such plans. Lawyers for the migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing safety concerns and allegations that migrants were being prepared for removal on military aircraft. The judge clarified that any imminent removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month, which barred deportations to countries other than the migrants' place of origin without due process. The article notes that Libya is considered unsafe due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the U.S. Surgeon General. Means replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination was withdrawn, and has been praised by Trump for her "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again) credentials. Means, who left traditional medicine to focus on addressing the root causes of illness, co-founded Levels, a health app connected to glucose monitors.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge back to Earth. Experts predict the spacecraft, which failed its mission to Venus due to a rocket malfunction, will reenter the atmosphere uncontrolled. The spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, posing a small risk to humans. While most of the spacecraft is expected to burn up during reentry, there is a possibility that the landing capsule, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, could survive, resulting in a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.</p>

          <p>Private investment firms of the ultra-rich are scaling back deal-making due to President Trump's tariffs, but continue to show interest in artificial intelligence startups. Single-family offices made 40 direct investments in April, with half of those deals related to AI. SandboxAQ, a quantitative AI firm, finalized its Series E round of $450 million, with backing from billionaires and their family offices. These family offices are considered value-added investors, offering expertise in both technology and finance (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Judge Dismisses Most Claims Against Celebrities in FTX Investor Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 08:51:54 EDT</div>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry. The ruling narrows the scope of a lawsuit accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge determined that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has committed to donating 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than initially planned. This pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever, allowing the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. Gates cites the ability to maximize impact now as the reason for accelerating the timeline, focusing on global health and education. The announcement signals sustained support for these causes and an eventual end to the foundation's global influence.</p>
