Smith was banned from the awards ceremony for 10 years after hitting Rock for joking about his wife's hair loss. He said he had to deal with a level of disapproval he had never experienced before, leading him to dissolve his addiction to the approval of others.

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival features contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. The festival includes the "Queer Passion," which focuses on the suffering of LGBTQ individuals, and the "Arabian Passion," which promotes peace between the West and East. Bach's music is being used to reflect on and comment on contemporary issues. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive. The optimism score has nothing to do with the content of this article.</p>
