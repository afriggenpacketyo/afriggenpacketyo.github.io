          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Jordin Alexander Melgar-Salmeron, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order. This is the fourth known case of a migrant being ordered back to the U.S. after being improperly removed. The court found Melgar-Salmeron's deportation "improper" and ordered the administration to ensure his case is handled as if he had not been deported.

          <p>Uber and Alphabet's Waymo have launched their robotaxi service to passengers in Atlanta, expanding their partnership after a similar launch in Austin, Texas. The Waymo robotaxis, featuring Waymo's driverless technology integrated into Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, will operate within a 65-square-mile area of Atlanta, excluding highways and airport routes. This move places Waymo ahead of Tesla, which recently debuted a pilot robotaxi service in Austin with a human valet on board. Waymo's robotaxis operate without any human supervisor and utilize lidar and radar sensors, and the partnership with Uber covers passenger rides, but not Uber Eats deliveries.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are racing to pass a massive tax and domestic policy bill by a self-imposed July 4 deadline, as President Trump pressures lawmakers to stay in Washington until the bill is approved. The Senate is facing challenges navigating a tight 53-47 margin and addressing disagreements over the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid funding. The Senate parliamentarian has advised that several controversial provisions would violate the Byrd Rule, requiring a 60-vote threshold for their inclusion. Despite these obstacles, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent remains optimistic about reaching a vote and sending the bill to the president by the deadline.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earned on a $10,000 1-year certificate of deposit (CD) versus a $10,000 high-yield savings account. With current rates at 4.45% for CDs and 4.30% for high-yield savings accounts, the CD is projected to earn slightly more interest over the year ($445 vs. $430). The article notes that CD interest rates are fixed, providing guaranteed earnings, while high-yield savings account rates are variable and subject to change. Given expectations of potential interest rate cuts, the article suggests a CD may be a more beneficial option for savers seeking to lock in a higher rate. (not investment advice)</p>
