          <h2>French Prime Minister Supports Suspending Macron's Pension Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 10:17:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has indicated his support for suspending President Macron's unpopular pension reform plans, which aim to raise the retirement age. Lecornu stated he would propose to parliament that the 2023 pension reform be suspended until after the next presidential elections, meaning there would be no increase in the retirement age before January 2028. This proposal, if realized, would mean Macron would fail to raise France's retirement age during his tenure, amid opposition from socialist and far-right blocs. Lecornu is seeking to pass a partial budget for 2026 to enable his government to function, but faces stiff resistance in parliament. The original proposal was to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p>

The bank's adjusted earnings per share were $2.24 against the expected $1.90, and revenue reached $22.09 billion, surpassing the anticipated $21.09 billion. Net income increased by 15% to $3.8 billion, and revenue grew by 9%, fueled by strong performances in services, banking, and markets. Citigroup is currently in the process of selling a 25% stake in its Mexico business, Banamex, prior to a public stock offering, which contributed to a 9% increase in expenses last quarter. The bank's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year, rising more than 37%.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that falling mortgage rates will lead to increased competition among homebuyers and potentially higher home prices. As mortgage rates decline, more people will qualify for higher loan amounts, intensifying competition in the housing market. While lower rates could make homeownership more accessible, any savings may be offset by rising home prices due to increased demand. Additionally, lenders may experience slower processing times due to a surge in mortgage applications, which could delay closing times and impact rate locks, however, the inventory is still relatively low, therefore it is still a good time to buy a home if you can afford it.

          <p>Former England bowler Stuart Broad believes that the current Australian cricket team is the weakest they have been since 2010, heading into the upcoming Ashes series. Broad highlighted question marks over the team's composition and the fitness of captain Pat Cummins, while also acknowledging the difficulty of winning in Australia. He contrasted this with what he sees as the strongest English team since 2010, suggesting England has a significant opportunity in the series. Broad emphasized that Australia typically needs to perform poorly for England to win, and England has a good chance of playing exceptionally well.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts the UK to be the second-fastest-growing economy in the G7 this year, with a growth rate of 1.3%. However, UK inflation is expected to rise to the highest in the G7 in 2025 and 2026, driven by larger energy and utility bills. The IMF also warned of a possible bursting of the US AI tech boom, which could rival the dot-com crash of 2000–01 in severity. The IMF cited Brexit as an example of how uncertainty around major changes in trading arrangements can, after a delay, lead to steady falls in investment. (not investment advice)</p>
