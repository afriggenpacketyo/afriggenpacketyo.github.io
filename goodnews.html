          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison for illegal wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Antle pleaded guilty to buying and selling endangered species like chimpanzees and cheetahs on the black market, using his conservation foundation to conceal the transactions. Despite his lawyers' plea for probation, the judge imposed jail time, a $55,000 fine, and forfeiture of animals and funds, marking a significant outcome in the efforts against the illegal animal trade.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings at the White House to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and a potential ceasefire deal. A U.S. envoy indicated that negotiators for Israel and Hamas are close to an agreement, with only one major issue remaining for a proposed 60-day truce that would include a hostage release. While the U.S. administration expressed optimism about the talks, Qatari mediators suggested more time may be needed to finalize the terms.</p>

The post, in which Collins claimed to have gone "two sizes down," was one of nine similar adverts banned in a recent crackdown. Although the specific medication was not named, the ASA determined the ad illegally promoted prescription drugs to the public, a breach of advertising codes.

The proposed 4,500-kilometer railway would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the port of Chancay, Peru, potentially shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days. While the project could reshape South American trade, the current agreement only covers technical, environmental, and economic studies, which are expected to take up to five years to complete.</p>
