        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reportedly exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins, aiming to make community sentences more impactful. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood seeks to expand unpaid work programs, partnering probation teams with local councils and private companies to assign tasks to offenders. Instead of wages, the money earned would go to a fund for victim support groups, with the intention of demonstrating that crime does not pay. The article highlights the government's efforts to address prison overcrowding and ensure punishment benefits victims and communities.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli soldier recently freed from Hamas captivity, thanked President Donald Trump in an emotional phone call, attributing his release to Trump's efforts.

The Alexander family issued a statement thanking President Trump and the negotiation team, calling the outcome a miracle.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, but with limitations, allowing its use only in adults 65 and older or those with health conditions increasing their COVID-19 risk. This decision contrasts with the broader approvals of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for individuals 12 and older. The FDA's restrictions reflect skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration officials.
