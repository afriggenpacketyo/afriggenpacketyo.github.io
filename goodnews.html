          <p>The U.S. labor market remained stable in May, with employers adding 139,000 jobs, exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% for the third consecutive month. While job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, the data suggests the job market is holding up despite concerns about the impact of tariffs, particularly in healthcare, leisure, and hospitality industries. Experts caution that economic challenges may still lie ahead, and the Federal Reserve is likely to remain cautious about interest rate cuts given these mixed signals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation, supported by prominent lawyers, is pressuring Paramount Global to abandon settlement talks with President Trump regarding his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS and "60 Minutes." The lawsuit, considered frivolous by First Amendment experts, stems from the news division's coverage of Trump. Concerns arise that a settlement could compromise CBS News' credibility to gain favor with the Trump administration for FCC approval of Paramount's sale to Skydance Media. Legal experts argue a settlement could violate fiduciary duties to shareholders and federal anti-bribery statutes.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio's absence from preparations for the call between President Trump and President Xi, as well as subsequent trade talk announcements, has raised questions about his influence on US-China relations. Trump described the call as "very positive" and named Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as future negotiators. This shift, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's deal-making preference, suggests a diminished role for Rubio, who has previously been a vocal critic of China. The focus on trade talks signals a prioritization of economic issues in the bilateral relationship.</p>
