          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and collaborator Adidas have issued apologies following accusations of cultural appropriation over their Oaxaca Slip-On shoe. The design drew criticism, including from Mexico's president, for being inspired by traditional huarache sandals from Indigenous Mexican communities without their involvement or credit. In response to the backlash, both Chavarria and Adidas have removed promotional images and expressed deep regret for not partnering with the Oaxacan community. Adidas is now in contact with Mexican officials to discuss restitution and how to repair the damage caused to the affected communities.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered rare advice to a caller, suggesting a home equity line of credit (HELOC) as a way to manage debt owed to an ex-wife. The caller, who has a 2.25% mortgage rate, needed to pay his ex-spouse $150,000 for her share of their home's equity. Ramsey supported using a HELOC to restructure the debt but challenged the man's emotional reasons for keeping the house, particularly for his very young children. He advised that moving on might be a wiser long-term decision, both emotionally and for his future life, rather than clinging to the property for sentimental reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern Chinese history, discusses the profound and often underestimated impact of World War II on China's development. In an interview, he explains that the conflict shattered the country's infrastructure and communications, forcing a near-total restart after the war. Mitter, currently the S.T. Lee Chair in US-Asia Relations at Harvard, emphasizes that understanding this history is crucial. He argues that looking back 80 years, it becomes clear that China's contemporary interests are best served by maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has reinstated a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Remote Islands Heritage marine national monument, overturning a recent Trump administration directive. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. Earthjustice, representing Hawaiian conservation and cultural groups, successfully argued that the administration violated federal law by bypassing the required public notice and comment period for changing the rules. This decision is being celebrated as a major victory for the preservation of the monument's vulnerable ecosystems and Indigenous cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new era under manager Arne Slot began with a 2-2 draw and a penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield, offering a glimpse of both brilliance and disarray. The team featured four new signings, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer. The offense showed spectacular potential, with new players Jeremie Frimpong and Hugo Ekitike both scoring on their debuts. However, the defense appeared vulnerable, twice surrendering leads and highlighting the need for reinforcement before the transfer window closes, leaving fans with a sense of a team that is still a work in progress.</p>

          <p>A man in Austria had a perilous journey after he was left behind by a high-speed train and clung to its exterior as it departed the station. The incident occurred in Sankt Poelten when the passenger, who had reportedly stepped onto the platform for a cigarette break, grabbed onto the space between two carriages. He banged on windows to get attention, prompting the conductor to perform an emergency stop, after which he was brought aboard. A railway spokesman condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible and dangerous, noting such behavior usually results in death.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams rookie running back Jarquez Hunter is making an impression with his powerful running style, which he attributes to his upbringing in rural Mississippi. Known for his leg strength and ability to break tackles, Hunter rushed for over 3,300 yards at Auburn before being drafted by the Rams. His coaches praise his focus and speed, which he calls his "super power." Hunter connects his on-field grit to the patience and discipline he learned off the field, from breaking horses and hauling in catfish to his dedicated powerlifting regimen, all of which have forged his determined approach to the game.</p>
