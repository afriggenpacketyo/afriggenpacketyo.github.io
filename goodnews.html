          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, following his recent announcement of a "partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details about the deal, particularly its structure and implications for U.S. Steel's operations. While Trump has stated that U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh and Nippon will invest $14 billion, specifics on the deal's mechanics are scarce. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick indicated that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" allowing it to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained, representing a national security agreement.</p>
