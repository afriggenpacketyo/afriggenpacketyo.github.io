          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision individuals. The student-designed machine can handle materials that commercial braille printers cannot and was created with open hardware, allowing BISM's visually impaired employees to operate it easily. The invention has already been used to produce 400 labels for a charity beer, streamlining a previously manual process.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old from Colorado, has finally had her long-delayed encounter with penguins, thanks to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance and Compassionate Hospice. In the 1950s, while working for the U.S. government in Argentina, Garcia was invited on a research expedition to Antarctica but was barred from going at the last minute simply because she was a woman. This lifelong disappointment was remedied with a special behind-the-scenes visit with African penguins at the zoo. Her family expressed immense joy at seeing her 70-year-old dream partially fulfilled.</p>

While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01% APY, select online banks offer significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms reaching 4.40% APY. The article explains that short-term CDs presently have higher rates than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to explore online banks and consider laddering CDs of various terms. (not investment advice)</p>

The streaming giant achieves this by offering a compelling combination of lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to a global audience of over 300 million subscribers. Netflix has become a vital home for passion projects and films with large budgets or risky genres that traditional studios might pass on. This strategy allows directors to realize their vision while Netflix saves on massive marketing costs associated with theatrical runs.</p>

Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave, which many women avoid. Campaigners, including musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a crucial step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness.</p>

The Dodgers, inspired by her work, have installed a similar tile wall in a clubhouse walkway at Dodger Stadium and placed a sign explicitly naming Bennett as the inspiration.

The city of Nagasaki reversed an earlier decision and accepted Taiwan's request to attend its August 9 ceremony. This move is politically sensitive, as Japan, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Last year, Nagasaki controversially excluded Israel from the event, and this year's inclusion of Taiwan is likely to be closely watched by Beijing, which considers the island a breakaway province.</p>
