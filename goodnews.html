          <p>Chelsea has decided not to sign winger Jadon Sancho on a permanent basis and will instead pay a penalty to send him back to Manchester United. Sancho moved to Stamford Bridge on loan last summer after a falling out with the previous United manager. United are willing to let the 25-year-old leave, but Chelsea chose not to exercise their option to buy him for a fee of about ¬£25m. Chelsea had to finish higher than 14th in the Premier League to trigger the obligation to buy Sancho.</p>
