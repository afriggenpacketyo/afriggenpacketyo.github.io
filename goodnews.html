          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to significantly cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE initiative. The preliminary injunction halts further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch, pending the outcome of a lawsuit. The judge emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, giving them duties that must be carried out, and that large-scale reorganizations cannot occur without congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, seeking to overturn the injunction.</p>

          <p>Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) has reopened to traffic following the Palisades fire that devastated homes and businesses in January. The reopening of the 11-mile stretch of PCH will provide greater access to Malibu and Pacific Palisades and ease commutes for those traveling from Ventura County and the west Valley. Officials are urging drivers to be cautious as road crews continue to work in the area, with reduced speed limits and traffic signals set to flashing red. The reopening is an important step forward in recovery efforts, but a heavy security presence will remain to restrict access into the burn areas.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Police Minister, Senzo Mchunu, has stated that recent crime statistics debunk claims of a "white genocide" in the country. Mchunu revealed that between January and March, five out of six people killed on farms were black, while one was white. He added that in the previous quarter, one of the 12 farm murder victims was white. This is the first time South Africa's crime statistics have been broken down by race, done in response to the recent genocide claims. Mchunu rejected allegations that the government was expropriating land held by white farmers and condemned Trump's comments on the issue.</p>

          <p>Nashville, Tennessee, has evolved from being known solely as "Music City" into a major U.S. metropolitan area, driven by rapid population growth, job opportunities in healthcare and tech, and a high quality of life.

The city's strategic planning has led to the creation of over 600,000 jobs since 1990 and a significant increase in per-capita income.

The decision follows a statement from the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah √ñcalan, suggesting the war had become obsolete. The Turkish government now has an opportunity to consolidate peace by offering amnesty to PKK fighters and addressing the grievances of the Kurdish population. The article emphasizes the importance of Turkey seizing this moment to prevent a resurgence of the conflict.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are exploring ways to meet President Trump's demand that they spend 5 percent of their national income on defense by broadening the definition of what qualifies as security-related expenditures. Under a proposed plan, countries would aim for military spending at 3.5 percent of their GDP, with an additional 1.5 percent allocated to non-traditional defense-related areas like infrastructure and cybersecurity. The move reflects efforts to appease Trump and acknowledge the need for increased defense spending in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The discussion on NATO spending is expected to be a central focus at the upcoming summit in The Hague.</p>

Advanced reactor companies Oklo and NuScale, along with Constellation Energy and Cameco Corp., saw substantial gains in their stock prices.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, reinstating almost all titles after a review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The review identified only about 20 books that require removal pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal followed a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for DEI titles. The Navy initially used its own terms, identifying a larger number of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi.</p>

The ship reportedly damaged a heating pipe in the cabin, but the homeowner was unharmed. Norwegian police have launched an investigation into the incident, and the shipping company is assisting with the investigation and conducting internal inquiries.
