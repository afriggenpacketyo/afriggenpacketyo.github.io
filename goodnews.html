          <p>Taco Bell is launching its "Live Más Café" concept within existing restaurants to attract younger customers and target a $5 billion drink business by 2030. The initiative features a dedicated "bellrista" counter and a menu of specialty coffees, chillers, and refrescas, moving beyond the chain's traditional food focus. This strategy taps into the growing trend of beverage-centric offerings in the fast-food industry, driven by Gen Z and millennial demand for unique flavors and snack-like treats. The company has seen early success with the concept, with some locations selling over 900 specialty drinks per day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Nicholas Thompson's new book, "The Running Ground," delves into the dual nature of running as both a physical sport and a form of mental exercise. Thompson, the CEO of The Atlantic, describes how running can be a meditative practice for clearing the mind, but transforms into an intense, focused challenge during workouts and races. He explains his preference for running without music to better understand his body's signals and maintain focus. The piece reflects on how the sport has shaped his identity and provided a connection to nature and his younger self.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals How Ontario's Ad Edited Ronald Reagan's 1987 Speech on Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 16:21:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the controversial Ontario advertisement that led to the suspension of U.S.-Canada trade talks reveals how it used former President Ronald Reagan's words. The article breaks down the 1987 radio address, showing that while the ad accurately quoted Reagan's criticisms of tariffs, it omitted the context that he was defending his own decision to impose tariffs on Japan. The ad also reordered sentences from different parts of the speech to create a more direct anti-tariff message. This editing is at the heart of the dispute, with critics arguing it misrepresents Reagan's full position on trade.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "Heart Life Music," country singer Kenny Chesney shares the story behind his collaboration with singer-songwriter Grace Potter on the hit song "You & Tequila." Chesney describes the search for a female vocalist to complete the track and how, despite her rock background seeming like an unlikely fit, Potter's soulful voice was the perfect choice. He recounts her arriving in Nashville after a long international flight and recording her part in just a few takes. The excerpt highlights the spontaneous and powerful connection the two artists formed, which Potter declared would make them "friends for life."</p>

          <p>The government of Ontario has announced it will pause its controversial anti-tariff ad campaign in the United States, following President Trump's decision to terminate trade negotiations with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated the pause would begin on Monday to "so that trade talks can resume," though the ad featuring Ronald Reagan's voice would continue to air through the weekend. The move represents a de-escalation after Trump criticized the ad as "egregious behavior." Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney indicated that Canada stands ready to resume negotiations once the U.S. is willing to engage.</p>

Championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren placed fourth, while his main rivals, teammate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, sat out the session to allow their teams' junior drivers to participate.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, seemingly linking it to stress, medical experts have clarified the connection. Doctors explain that while stress itself does not directly cause an aneurysm, it can elevate blood pressure, which is a significant risk factor for their formation and growth. The primary causes are typically genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. Most aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but managing blood pressure and stress is crucial for preventing a potentially life-threatening brain bleed.</p>

The facility's operations had long been a source of complaints, from coating the campus in toxic dust to causing explosions that disrupted classes.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a slower pace than the 3.1% anticipated by economists. The data suggests that the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices has remained relatively muted, as businesses absorb some of the costs. The Department of Labor released the figures despite the ongoing government shutdown, as they are necessary for calculating the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. This report is seen as providing support for the Federal Reserve to implement another interest rate cut to bolster a slowing job market. (not investment advice)</p>
