          <p>World-renowned battery scientist Guo Zaiping has accepted a position as chair professor of energy materials at City University of Hong Kong, leaving her role at the University of Adelaide in Australia. Guo is celebrated for her groundbreaking research in advanced materials for energy storage, with work that could significantly enhance the performance and driving range of electric vehicle batteries. Her appointment is a major addition to the university's materials science program, which is highly ranked globally.

          <h2>UK Government Plans Licensing Reforms to Protect Pubs and Music Venues from Noise Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 03:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing the struggling hospitality sector. The reforms would require developers building near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing and would fast-track permissions for new businesses in designated areas. This initiative seeks to reverse the trend of pub closures by making it easier to operate and expand, particularly with outdoor dining and drinking. While the government touts the plan as cutting red tape, the opposition has criticized it as hypocritical given other tax policies affecting the industry.</p>

          <h2>Ghana's Government Introduces Ambitious '24-Hour Economy' Initiative to Boost Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 03:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has launched a "24-hour economy" program, a cornerstone of his economic revival plan aimed at transforming the nation from an import-based to a self-sufficient economy. The initiative proposes that key industries operate in three eight-hour shifts, creating around-the-clock productivity and potentially 1.7 million new jobs. However, the ambitious plan faces significant hurdles, including a need for approximately $4 billion in funding, which is challenging given Ghana's existing debt. Experts also point to infrastructure deficits, like unreliable power, and the need for a major cultural shift in work habits for the policy to succeed. (not investment advice)</p>
