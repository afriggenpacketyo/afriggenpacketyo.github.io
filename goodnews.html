          <p>The Trump administration expresses confidence in securing investors for the Alaska LNG project, despite its $40 billion price tag, envisioning an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes countries seeking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. will invest in American energy, but analysts remain skeptical about the project's commercial viability. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum notes the Department of Defense is prepared to support the project by purchasing gas for military bases in Alaska. The project aims to serve domestic demand initially, given declining natural gas supplies in the Cook Inlet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight USDA offices in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The closures were initially planned to cut costs, but lawmakers argued they would harm farmers' access to essential resources. The USDA will rescind termination notices for eight offices, but discussions continue regarding the Mt. Shasta office. The administration maintains its commitment to optimizing building capacity and consolidating underutilized offices.</p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which is expected to ease congestion. The runway had been closed for weeks, contributing to flight delays and cancellations, exacerbated by staffing shortages and technical problems. The Port Authority accelerated the construction schedule by hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors. The FAA is working to certify the runway for arriving flights, which could increase the airport's hourly flight capacity.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has demonstrated remarkable ingenuity and effectiveness in its defense against Russia, particularly through the use of drones. A recent operation involving simultaneous attacks on Russian airfields, including those in Siberia and above the Arctic Circle, highlighted the vulnerability of expensive military assets. The attacks, which reportedly destroyed or damaged more than 40 aircraft, cost Ukraine significantly less than the damage inflicted on Russia. The success of these operations underscores the need for major changes in military strategy and security, particularly regarding drone defense.</p>
