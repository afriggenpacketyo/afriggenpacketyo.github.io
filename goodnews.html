          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, ending an indefinite suspension that began last week. The suspension was enacted after Kimmel made comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the network deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive" amid a tense national atmosphere. The decision to pull the show had sparked significant debate over free speech, drawing criticism from other late-night hosts and industry figures, as well as praise from former President Trump.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their symptoms persist or worsen after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. This guidance, while not a law, aims to improve patient safety by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths.</p>

          <p>As Chinese officials begin drafting the nation's 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030, the document is seen as a critical tool for navigating significant domestic and international economic challenges. The plan will outline key policy priorities intended to steer China toward its long-term goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. Amid rising global uncertainty, experts suggest that Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to achieve its ambitious economic and social development objectives.

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, alerted authorities to concerning online posts by a former student, leading to a swift lockdown and the recovery of weapons from the individual's home. Officials from the organization noted this was the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped avert since its launch, highlighting the critical role of community reporting in preventing violence.</p>
