          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 16:38:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity surged to a new record of $11.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with the average homeowner having access to $213,000. This increase presents opportunities for homeowners to borrow against their property's value amid high inflation and borrowing costs. The article outlines several methods for accessing this equity, including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and reverse mortgages for seniors. While these options offer lower interest rates than many other forms of credit, they use the home as collateral, posing a risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France, one of the country's largest, temporarily halted production after a massive swarm of jellyfish clogged the filter drums of its cooling system. The plant, which draws water from the North Sea, experienced the issue on Sunday, but officials confirmed that the safety of the facility and the environment were not compromised. Marine biologists note that warming sea waters may be contributing to an increase in jellyfish populations, which can be carried by currents toward coastal infrastructure. The plant's operations were impacted, but the situation was managed without incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order delaying the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The move follows recent trade negotiations in Stockholm and provides a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Without the extension, U.S. duties on Chinese imports were set to revert to peak levels of 145%. This delay continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy adjustments, creating uncertainty for businesses affected by the fluctuating tariff landscape. The decision reflects ongoing efforts to negotiate a broader trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will be shutting down its dial-up internet service in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 30. The service, famous for its distinctive connection sound, was a gateway to the internet for millions in the 1990s but has since been superseded by broadband technology. At its peak, AOL had over 30 million subscribers, but by 2023, fewer than 300,000 Americans reported using a dial-up connection. The company stated the decision was part of a routine evaluation of its products, marking the end of a significant era in internet history.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge on Monday following news of a production halt at a key Chinese mine. Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) suspended operations at its Yichun Project, which accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply, due to an expired permit. This development has triggered investor expectations of rising lithium prices as the global supply tightens. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production as soon as possible, but the suspension adds pressure to an already constrained market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates, a $50,000 investment in a certificate of deposit (CD) can generate significant returns, making it an attractive option for risk-averse savers. The article calculates potential earnings across various terms, showing that a one-year CD at 4.40% could earn $2,200, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could yield over $11,000. While stock market returns can be higher, CDs offer guaranteed, predictable interest and are FDIC-insured, providing a safe alternative to market volatility. This makes them a viable tool for those prioritizing capital preservation and reliable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Cannabis Stocks Surge on News That Trump is Considering Marijuana Reclassification</h2>

          <p>The cannabis sector experienced a major rally, with stocks like Tilray Brands and Canopy Growth soaring after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. Such a move, potentially to Schedule III, would significantly benefit the industry by easing tax burdens and encouraging institutional investment. Trump stated a decision would be made in the coming weeks on the "very complicated subject." While he cannot unilaterally reclassify the drug, his public support has generated significant optimism and a record trading day for several cannabis-related ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The deal allows the companies to resume selling their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls but later restricted. Analysts view the move as a transactional approach by the Trump administration, securing a form of "indirect tariff" while allowing U.S. firms to compete in the critical Chinese market against rivals like Huawei. While investors see it as a net positive, the deal sets a strange precedent for U.S. trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

He praised Tan's track record, including his turnaround of Cadence Design Systems, and asserted that there is no one better equipped to lead Intel's transformation. The defense comes as Tan faces scrutiny over his ties to Chinese companies, which some politicians have framed as a national security risk, highlighting the intense political pressures facing corporate leaders.</p>

A new study in *Nature Climate Change* suggests that even with moderate climate action, the world could face shortfalls of up to 12 key minerals by 2100.

          <p>For beginner investors, gold can serve as a valuable portfolio diversifier, but several factors should be considered before buying. The article advises new investors to evaluate their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth protector than an income generator. It also highlights the need to understand gold's price volatility, which has seen record highs recently, potentially making it a costly entry point. Finally, beginners should assess their need for a diversification tool to hedge against inflation and market instability, and consider consulting a financial professional to create a personalized strategy.
