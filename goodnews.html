A study found at-home screening was as effective as in-office screenings and preferred by women, potentially increasing screening rates. At-home screenings are already available in other countries, and this approval aims to reduce cervical cancer rates by improving access and convenience.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir, media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct in creative and business decision-making, particularly in the context of developing made-for-TV movies. Diller argues that relying too heavily on data and research can be detrimental, as it focuses on what has happened rather than what could happen. He emphasizes that instinct and common sense are essential for identifying good ideas. He cites the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects greenlit based on instinct and vision.</p>
