          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, newly formed ones generate a unique form of "music" as they settle into a stable shape. This phenomenon occurs when a new black hole, created from a star's collapse or object fusion, rapidly stabilizes, causing distortions in space-time that ring out like a pure sound. These gravitational waves are not literal music but can be translated into audible frequencies for human experience. Scientists anticipate that we will soon have the capability to listen to these cosmic vibrations, offering a new way to study these celestial objects.</p>

          <p>Supermodel Heidi Klum recently shared a photo on Instagram from a bikini photoshoot in St. Barth where she experienced a minor wardrobe malfunction. While posing in the ocean with seashells covering her chest, she humorously captioned the image "Woopsy," using a star emoji to maintain her modesty. The article also touches on her personal life, including her recent sixth wedding anniversary with husband Tom Kaulitz. Klum has previously addressed public criticism regarding the 17-year age gap in her marriage, attributing the negativity to spitefulness and age-shaming.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. This initiative is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the payment accounts for over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poorer province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. Experts believe this could stimulate consumption and potentially increase birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural areas.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market following previous U.S. export restrictions. The agreement signals a potential easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, as both sides have recently made concessions on trade controls. This move comes as the U.S. continues to push for greater domestic investment in the technology and AI sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is aggressively pivoting his company's focus toward artificial intelligence, believing that artificial superintelligence (ASI) will arrive within a decade. Son is steering SoftBank to invest heavily in the entire AI ecosystem, from chip designers like Arm and Ampere to foundational models like OpenAI. This strategy follows a period of significant losses for SoftBank's Vision Fund, which had previously made large, sometimes unsuccessful, bets on companies like WeWork. Despite past stumbles, Son's conviction is that AI represents a fundamental technological shift, and he is determined to position SoftBank at its center. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol made Major League Baseball history by becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season game, officiating at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was celebrated by family and supporters, and she later donated her cap to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Pawol, 48, has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016 and worked spring training games before her historic promotion.

          <p>A coalition of European nations, including the UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement emphasizing that peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. This comes as President Trump plans a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which currently does not include Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The White House has indicated it is open to a joint meeting, but Putin reportedly requested a bilateral summit. The European leaders stressed their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and stated that any meaningful negotiations must begin from the current line of contact.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour title in over two years by winning the St. Jude Championship in a tense playoff against American JJ Spaun. The victory came on the third sudden-death hole after both players finished the tournament at 16-under par. Rose, 45, birdied the final playoff hole to claim his 12th PGA Tour title. The result was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke behind, continuing his search for a maiden PGA Tour victory.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England find employment within the National Health Service (NHS). The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to hire graduates based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. This move addresses concerns that there are significantly more nursing graduates than available positions in some areas. While nursing unions welcomed the initiative, employer representatives raised questions about how the new measures would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance demonstrated confidence by using his mobility, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes. In contrast, competitor Taylor Heinicke appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the Chargers' defensive depth, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, strengthening his case for a roster spot.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a possible connection between nose-picking and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that damaging the nasal tissue can allow certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, to travel more easily to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response, the mouse brains deposited amyloid-beta protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's. While the findings are preliminary and have not been replicated in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental factors that could contribute to the onset of the neurodegenerative condition.</p>

The nine-day drill, involving over a dozen ships and numerous fighter jets, focused on enhancing interoperability through cross-deck operations and anti-submarine warfare training.

          <p>A 60-foot passenger boat named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor over the weekend. With two crew members aboard, the vessel was hit by large waves that disrupted its course, causing it to lose propulsion and drift into shallow water against a concrete wall. Video captured the boat being tossed by the waves, appearing to nearly capsize before coming to rest. No injuries were reported, and the boat's fuel and batteries were removed to prevent pollution while the owner arranged for its removal.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, posits that World War II was a pivotal and often underestimated factor in shaping the nation's trajectory. The conflict devastated the infrastructure built in the preceding decades, forcing China to essentially restart its development after the war. In an analysis of the war's 80-year legacy, Mitter suggests that despite its tumultuous history, China's contemporary strategic and economic interests are best served by maintaining peace and stability throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This perspective offers a historical context for understanding China's current geopolitical posture.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration move to allow commercial fishing in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had reversed Obama-era protections for the federally protected area. The court stated that regulations banning commercial fishing in the monument remain in effect, siding with environmental and Native Hawaiian groups who argued the administration illegally bypassed the formal public process for changing fishing rules. The decision is being celebrated as a major victory for marine conservation.</p>
