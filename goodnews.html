          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies from his blood have shown the ability to protect against fatal doses from various snake species in animal trials. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, inspired by the high number of deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites worldwide. Researchers identified broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target common elements across different toxins, leading to the creation of a cocktail that protected mice from fatal doses of venom from 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as complex international relations with the U.S. and China. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living issues, with both major parties offering small-scale solutions. The election also reflects a shift away from the two major parties, with voters turning to independent candidates and minor parties, signaling dissatisfaction with the traditional political landscape. The opposition leader's adoption of some Trump-like policies initially seemed promising but has since become a liability.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to increased capital inflow. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to stabilize the currency, marking its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially leading to further capital inflows into Hong Kong.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing significant administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating political power. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media outlets, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs, approximately 15% of the bureaucracy. This overhaul is also intended to address dysfunction caused by the country's anti-corruption campaign and to strengthen political governance in the face of external pressures. These changes are occurring ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in January 2026, potentially allowing the top leadership to exert more direct control over local affairs.</p>
