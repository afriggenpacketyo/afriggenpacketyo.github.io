          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 12:02:42 EDT</div>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university" under the proposed name London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by the Office for Students, aims to provide a stronger financial foundation amid economic challenges facing higher education, with many universities in deficit. While officials insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union predicts job redundancies, particularly as Kent had faced financial difficulties. The new institution will serve nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded in the individual university names.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock surged by 40% on Wednesday, marking its most significant single-day gain since 1992, driven by exceptional demand for its cloud services. The company reported a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a substantial increase from the previous year, propelling its market capitalization towards $1 trillion. This boom is attributed to its strategic position in the artificial intelligence sector, particularly its cloud infrastructure and access to Nvidia's GPUs. Analysts have expressed surprise and confidence, despite Oracle's slight miss on first-quarter revenue and earnings expectations, solidifying its role as a key AI enabler. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf stated his strong support for the Federal Reserve's independence but affirmed President Donald Trump's right to express his views on monetary policy. Scharf distinguished between the President's vocal opinions on interest rates and any actual impact on the Fed's autonomy, noting the central bank's leaders serve terms distinct from elected officials. Trump has frequently criticized the Fed and its Chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates, even attempting to remove a Fed Governor. Scharf highlighted that while Trump is particularly vocal, political commentary on Fed decisions is not new. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stocks closed marginally lower on Wednesday as investors processed various economic and corporate news, including U.S. inflation data and corporate earnings. Despite Wall Street's S&P 500 reaching a record high due to softer-than-expected U.S. inflation, European markets remained muted. This U.S. data has intensified expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, potentially a larger half-point reduction. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk shares rose after job cuts, while Zara owner Inditex gained on strong Autumn/Winter collection sales. Geopolitical tensions, including President Trump's call for tariffs on China and India, also influenced investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

The award, celebrating the best British or Irish album, will be presented in Newcastle for the first time, addressing past accusations of London-centricity. The diverse shortlist also features artists like Sam Fender, Fontaines DC, and PinkPantheress, reflecting a vibrant music scene across the UK and Ireland.</p>

          <p>Payments are now beginning for Facebook's $725 million privacy settlement, with millions of eligible users anticipated to receive their share within the coming weeks. This settlement addresses multiple lawsuits alleging the social media giant improperly shared user data with third-party entities, a controversy ignited by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Claimants who had an active Facebook account between 2007 and 2022 will receive a portion of the net settlement, calculated based on their duration of platform use. Approved individuals will be notified via email, with distributions expected over the next ten weeks, though Meta denies wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has committed $50 million to research women's health issues, as part of her larger $1 billion pledge over two years. This funding will target chronically underfunded areas such as autoimmune conditions, mental health, and cardiovascular disease, which disproportionately affect women or manifest differently in them. Historically, medical research has often used men's bodies as the default, leading to significant gaps in understanding women's health. The grant aims to accelerate breakthroughs and address health inequities, which a McKinsey report estimated could add $1 trillion to the global economy annually by 2040.</p>

          <p>Ryder Cup organizers have asked President Donald Trump to delay his arrival at Bethpage this month until after the opening tee shots, aiming to prevent security chaos. This request follows disruptions caused by enhanced security for Trump's recent visit to the U.S. Open tennis final, which led to significant queues and delays. With the Ryder Cup expecting 50,000 attendees daily and no flexibility in starting times, officials hope Trump will attend for the afternoon session instead. The PGA of America stated that specific details are unconfirmed, but their priority is a "seamless, secure and first-class event" for all guests.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, granting her a preliminary injunction. The judge ruled that Cook made a strong case that her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, which is limited to conduct in office, not prior allegations like mortgage fraud that Trump cited. Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, denies wrongdoing. This decision upholds the Fed's independence and ensures Cook will participate in the upcoming meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. The Supreme Court is anticipated to have the final say on this unprecedented case.</p>

These minuscule specks are enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds often produced by microorganisms on Earth. While non-biological processes could also be responsible, the findings are significant enough to warrant further in-depth analysis, ideally with samples returned to Earth.

While teachers and parents largely support the ban, older students remain skeptical. This trend reflects a national debate on smartphone regulations in schools, with some advocating for bans up to tenth grade and others emphasizing media literacy.
