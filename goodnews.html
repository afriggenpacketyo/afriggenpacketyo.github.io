        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A blood test for Alzheimer's disease is set to become available in the United States in late June, developed by Fujirebio Holdings. Cleared by the FDA, the test detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals 55 and older exhibiting symptoms. This less expensive and faster method, taking about 30 minutes from blood draw to diagnosis, could significantly improve access to new Alzheimer's treatments by offering a quicker and easier alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests. The availability of this test is viewed as a critical step in making new types of Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments widely accessible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed a bill proposing a tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tips for tipped workers. This bill also extends business tax credits for payroll taxes on tips in beauty and spa services. The proposal, championed by Sen. Ted Cruz, includes stipulations such as excluding employees with compensation exceeding $160,000. The bill, if enacted, would cost $110 billion in federal revenues over 10 years and awaits consideration in the House of Representatives before potentially becoming law. Sen. Jacky Rosen noted that the bill fulfills one of President Donald Trump's key campaign promises.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the ‚ÄúGolden Dome‚Äù missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country‚Äôs air defense system by the end of his term. U.S. officials claim the Golden Dome is necessary to protect against ‚Äúcatastrophic attacks,‚Äù though experts cite logistical and financial challenges. The project, a priority for Trump since taking office, is intended to build a defense system similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome. The project is estimated to cost between $175 billion and $542 billion, with potential funding from the tax cut and spending bill and possible participation from Canada.</p>

          <p>Koizumi Shinjiro has vowed to ease worries about high rice prices upon appointment as the new farm chief in Japan. This announcement follows the resignation of the previous farm minister, Taku Eto, due to public outcry over his comments about receiving rice as gifts instead of buying it. The appointment of Koizumi signals a shift in focus towards addressing the rising cost of rice, which has become a significant concern for Japanese consumers. The new farm chief will be tasked with implementing measures to stabilize rice prices and alleviate the financial burden on households.</p>

          <p>The media's focus on young men allegedly fueling the rise of the far right overlooks a more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, young women are increasingly turning towards the left. Research indicates that young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, with young women being more supportive of abortion rights, feminism, environmental concerns, and redistribution. This shift presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right.</p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a shortage of veterinary professionals caused by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. California shelters are facing a lack of animal medical care, leading to overcrowding and euthanasia. The pandemic exacerbated this crisis, with demand for veterinary services increasing exponentially. Veterinary students face tuition costs of around $67,000 per year, leading to significant debt, and the profession has a high suicide rate. Despite these challenges, investments in veterinarian medicine are popular, with corporations acquiring clinics and increasing pet care prices.</p>

The decision comes after ministers said the company should not be handing itself bonuses after presiding over years of mismanagement.
