          <p>A meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being older than Earth itself. Researchers from the University of Georgia analyzed fragments and determined it to be a chondrite meteorite, approximately 4.5 billion years old. The event, which caused a loud boom across the state, marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia. Scientists hope to use data from this event to better understand and guard against the threat of future asteroid impacts.</p>

          <p>A Kentucky man called into The Ramsey Show proposing to take out a new mortgage on his father's home to consolidate $110,000 in student loans and credit card debt. The show's hosts strongly advised against this plan, arguing that it would involve taking on new debt for a depreciating asset. Instead, they recommended the "debt snowball" method, urging the couple to leverage their six-figure combined income and low rent to aggressively pay off the debt within a few years.

          <p>Actress Lindsay Lohan has stated that the intense and terrifying experiences she had with paparazzi in her youth led to "PTSD to the extreme." This was a primary motivation for her and her husband, Bader Shammas, to raise their son in Dubai, where she feels safe and can lead a normal life. Lohan noted that while social media has given celebrities more control over their own narratives compared to the early 2000s, the lack of privacy in Hollywood remains a significant stressor. She credits her move to Dubai in 2014 with allowing her to separate her private and public lives.</p>

          <p>Miami's historic Freedom Tower, a key processing center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s, is reopening with a new exhibition focused on personal stories of exile. The exhibition, "Libertad," features hundreds of oral histories, including that of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old in 1967. Now owned by Miami-Dade College, the refurbished national landmark aims to preserve the legacy of the more than half a million Cubans who passed through its doors, shaping the city of Miami.</p>

          <p>In her book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her personal journey with anorexia nervosa, which began after her mother's death when she was 11. The book combines memoir with research to explore the concept of living in a "middle place" of recovery, rather than striving for an elusive state of being "fully recovered." Tarpley argues that embracing imperfections and accepting setbacks has allowed her to live a fulfilling life, and she discusses the challenges of parenting while still contending with her own disorder in a world of resurgent diet culture.</p>

          <h2>Navigating the Ethics of Meat Consumption for Health and Animal Welfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of a person with health issues who struggles with a strict vegetarian diet but is committed to animal welfare. It contrasts deontological (rule-based) and utilitarian (consequence-based) ethics with a pragmatic approach, suggesting that moral choices depend on context, not absolute rules. The article recommends a "reducetarian" diet, which focuses on minimizing harm by choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products and consuming larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, thereby balancing personal well-being with ethical considerations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to develop a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor for the moon by the end of the decade, a crucial step for establishing a permanent lunar settlement. This move signals a renewed focus on the Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2027 and build a base. The push is partly framed as a national security issue to counter a planned Chinese-Russian lunar base, which is slated to have a more powerful reactor. A lunar base could enable new scientific research, such as radio astronomy on the moon's far side.</p>

          <h2>A Look at Michael Young's 1958 Satirical Novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy"</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recommends Michael Young's 1958 novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy," a book that ironically popularized a term Young intended as a pejorative. The satirical work imagines a dystopian future where society is rigidly stratified by educational achievement, leading to a populist revolt against the meritocratic elite. The recommendation highlights the book's relevance today, as it critiques a system where intelligence and effort become the new basis for class division. The piece is part of a culture roundup featuring a writer's current interests.</p>

          <p>Facing reduced reliability from traditional water sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California water agencies are planning for a more resilient future. The Metropolitan Water District is pursuing a diversified portfolio, including a major wastewater recycling project in Carson, expanding stormwater capture, and potentially investing in new transport infrastructure. Drawing lessons from crises in cities like Cape Town, the goal is to create a sustainable and affordable water supply to avoid a "Day Zero" scenario where taps could run dry for the region's 19 million residents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities like Los Angeles and Bangkok face increased flooding due to climate change, some architects are championing the "sponge city" model. This approach uses green infrastructure like parks and wetlands to absorb, clean, and store stormwater, rather than channeling it away with concrete. A successful example is Bangkok's Benjakitti Park, which transformed a former factory site into a flood-mitigating public space. While L.A. has programs to fund similar projects, progress is slowed by high costs and bureaucracy, highlighting the challenges of implementing these nature-based solutions.</p>

          <p>Amid the confusion and limitations of recycling, the reuse movement is gaining traction as a way to combat single-use waste. A recent 12-week pilot program in Petaluma, California, tested a city-wide system for reusable beverage cups, where consumers could return them to collection bins for washing and redistribution. Sponsored by companies like Starbucks and McDonald's, the program saw a return rate of over 50%, suggesting that community-wide convenience can be a powerful incentive for sustainable behavior. Organizers are now planning a similar, larger-scale program in Southern California.</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts a frantic escape from Los Angeles ahead of an imminent nuclear strike, has found a new audience and cult status in recent years. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the movie is noted for its affectionate portrayal of L.A. locations like the Miracle Mile and the La Brea Tar Pits. The story begins as a romance between characters played by Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham before pivoting to a thriller. Its enduring appeal lies in its specific, anxious vision of an L.A.-centric apocalypse.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing a new tech boom centered on artificial intelligence, with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic driving a surge in venture capital funding and office leases. This "AI gold rush" is bringing a renewed sense of economic optimism to a city recovering from a post-pandemic downtown exodus. However, the frenzy is also accompanied by anxiety over the high cost of living, ongoing tech layoffs, and fears that AI will displace human workers. The city has become a hub for AI-related events, communities, and public debate about the technology's future.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England from Monday to Wednesday. The heatwave is caused by warm air being drawn up from the south, marking a significant shift from the stormy weather experienced earlier in the week.

He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an unfamiliar environment without prior specific training. Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, Wang expressed that while hardware is advancing, the "AI for embodied intelligence" is still the main bottleneck. He suggested that new AI models capable of generating interactive world models might be key to this leap.</p>
