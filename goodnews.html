          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the North Carolina Board of Elections certify the results of the 2024 State Supreme Court race, marking a significant legal win for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers ruled that removing disputed ballots, as sought by Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin, would violate voters' constitutional rights. The ruling, however, has been temporarily stayed for seven days to allow Judge Griffin time to appeal. Justice Riggs declared victory and affirmed her commitment to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. Optimism score of 80 because the ruling was upheld.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. This contradicts Trump's justification for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo's release further undermines the Trump administration's rationale and raises questions about its criticism of news coverage on the issue. The intelligence community based its conclusion on evidence that Venezuelan security forces have arrested Tren de Aragua members and engaged in armed confrontations with them.</p>

The site was one of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography.

The legislation, backed by first lady Melania Trump, requires social media platforms and other websites to remove images and videos within 48 hours after a victim's request.</p>
