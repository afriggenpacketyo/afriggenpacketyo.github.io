          <p>The United Kingdom is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade agreement with the United States, potentially becoming the first country to do so after the U.S. announced new tariffs. While the details remain uncertain, it is speculated whether both sides will sign a finalized deal or a framework for an agreement that they would continue negotiating in the coming months. Despite running a trade deficit with the U.S., Britain was spared the higher tariffs when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy.</p>
