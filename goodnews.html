          <p>Shetland Islands Council is advancing plans to replace its aging ferry system with undersea tunnels, drawing inspiration from the Faroe Islands. The Faroese prime minister highlighted how similar infrastructure projects boosted his country's growth and population, a model Shetland hopes to replicate to support its vital salmon and fishing industries. The project, likely funded by borrowing and tolls, is seen as a transformative investment to connect outlying isles and enhance economic viability, despite some local concerns about altering the island's character.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm, Sweden, is being redeveloped into what is billed as the world's largest wooden city, a $1.25 billion project led by developer Atrium Ljungberg. The area, named Sickla, will utilize cross-laminated timber for new homes, offices, and schools, aiming to showcase sustainable construction and significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete. This initiative reflects Sweden's deep cultural and economic connection to its forests and seeks to shift the industry mindset by demonstrating that large-scale timber construction is both viable and environmentally beneficial.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received assurances from the U.S. government that it will be granted licenses to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a significant development after sales were halted by export curbs. The H20 chips were specifically designed to comply with earlier U.S. restrictions, and their renewed availability is expected to help Nvidia reinforce its market leadership in China. The decision follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were hindering American tech leadership and had already cut the company's market share in the country.

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. Despite the positive GDP figure, other indicators revealed underlying weaknesses, including slower-than-expected retail sales growth and a deepening slump in real estate investment. While the strong industrial output reduces immediate pressure for large-scale stimulus, economists warn of fragility, pointing to weak consumer prices and the ongoing property downturn as significant challenges for policymakers ahead.

          <p>Chinese commercial space company Space Pioneer announced that its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a crucial ground-based stress test, a significant milestone following an explosive failure during a similar test last year. The recent test simulated key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, with the rocket's nine-engine first stage successfully withstanding the enormous forces involved. This progress is vital for the development of the powerful rocket, which is designed to be reusable and support China's ambitions in commercial spaceflight and satellite deployment.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars to build enormous AI data centers in the United States, with the goal of developing "superintelligence." The first facility, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in Ohio by 2026, while another, Hyperion, will be built in Louisiana. These multi-gigawatt clusters are part of Meta's aggressive strategy to lead in the AI field, though the plan highlights the immense energy and water consumption required for such advanced computational infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A commission launched by the Board of Deputies of British Jews has released a report detailing a rise in antisemitism since October 7th and providing ten key recommendations for tackling it. The report calls for the creation of a standardized antisemitism training qualification and urges that Judaism be consistently understood as both an ethnicity and a religion. It specifically highlights issues within the NHS, recommending a summit to address what it calls an unaddressed problem of antisemitism felt by Jewish employees and patients, and suggests including this training in all diversity programs.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan had improved, but advocacy groups sued, stating the country remains unsafe. The ruling provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program, which grants them protection from deportation and work permits, allowing time for further legal arguments on the matter.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants, potentially revealing a hidden layer of ecosystem communication. In a controlled experiment, female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making high-frequency sounds associated with dehydration, suggesting they could perceive the plant's distress. While plants are not sentient, these sounds are physical byproducts of their condition. The discovery opens up a new field of study into how this auditory information might influence the behavior of insects and other animals.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new manufacturing technique that could resolve long-standing issues in the production of high-performance aircraft engines, a critical area where China has trailed Western nations. The method focuses on rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs, which are core engine components that must withstand extreme stress and temperatures. This advancement, reported by the Dalian University of Technology, could significantly improve the power, efficiency, and durability of homegrown engines, potentially accelerating the development of China's next-generation fighter jets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with Epstein should have also protected his co-conspirators, including her, from federal charges. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and that Maxwell was, at best, an incidental beneficiary, urging the high court to uphold the lower court's decision.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered one of the world's most difficult footraces. The 135-mile ultramarathon starts below sea level in Death Valley and climbs over 8,300 feet, with runners facing extreme heat. Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a score with the course after he was unable to finish within the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. His achievement demonstrates remarkable endurance and determination.</p>
