          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 08:44:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. airlines are preparing to face investors with a mixed outlook following a busy July 4th holiday period. While millions traveled, average domestic airfare has fallen 3% from last year, indicating weaker than expected demand and prompting airlines to put summer travel "on sale." Many major carriers have withdrawn their 2025 forecasts, citing economic uncertainty and challenges like reduced overseas tourism. Investors are now watching for signs of demand recovery and potential further capacity cuts for the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated surprising strength in June, adding 147,000 nonfarm payrolls, which surpassed economists' estimates of 110,000. This resilience comes amid President Trump's calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, beating forecasts, while a modest 0.2% monthly increase in average hourly earnings suggests inflation remains subdued. Government hiring, particularly in state and local education, was a significant contributor to the job gains. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two bills aimed at boosting housing construction by reforming the state's environmental review process. The new laws exempt most urban, multifamily housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and make it easier for cities to update zoning for more homebuilding. Proponents, part of a growing "YIMBY" movement, argue this will help address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis by reducing delays and litigation. The move represents a significant policy shift for Democrats, prioritizing material abundance over the objections of some environmental and labor groups.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, frontman of the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, is using his platform to challenge the political alignment of his working-class fanbase with Donald Trump. In a recent interview, Casey recounted confronting a fan wearing a MAGA hat at a show, wagering that the merchandise was not American-made, which it wasn't. He emphasizes that his band stands with workers and against what he calls the "scam" of Trumpism, even if it means losing fans. Casey believes it is crucial to stand up to bullies and expresses frustration that more artists are not speaking out during this perilous political moment.</p>

          <p>A cultural debate is unfolding among parents about whether it is possible for today's children to experience a '90s-style summer' with less structure and more free time. While some parents are opting for fewer camps in favor of unscheduled play, experts note significant differences from past decades. Children today have less downtime, are more supervised, and their leisure is dominated by digital devices like phones and tablets. Although teens can be savvy about managing their screen time, the nature of play has fundamentally changed, making the idyllic, screen-free, unstructured summer of the past a challenging ideal to replicate in the modern era.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have announced a new trade agreement, providing insight into the Trump administration's approach to tariffs ahead of a looming deadline. Under the deal, the U.S. will apply a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports, while Vietnam will not tariff U.S. goods and will impose a 40% duty on transshipped products from other countries. Analysts suggest this framework indicates that future deals with other nations, particularly in emerging Asia, may involve higher-than-expected tariffs. The agreement highlights the administration's strategy of using bilateral negotiations to reshape global trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, "A Physical Education," author Casey Johnston details her transformative journey from joyless cardio and calorie restriction to the empowering world of weight lifting. The book serves as a critique of pervasive diet culture, which often pushes women toward a goal of perpetual shrinkage. Johnston argues that strength training reframes the purpose of exercise and nutrition, shifting the focus from whittling away to building up, from aesthetics to function, and from restriction to fueling the body for performance. This approach offers a path to unite mind and body in the pursuit of strength, rather than fighting against oneself.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, prosecutors detailed the key evidence that led to his capture. The case was solved using a combination of cell phone tracking, surveillance video, and crucial DNA from a knife sheath left at the scene. Investigators ultimately confirmed Kohberger as the suspect by matching this DNA to a sample obtained from a Q-tip secretly collected from his family's trash. While the evidence explains how the crime was solved, Kohberger's motive and connection to the victims remain unclear as the plea deal avoids a full trial.</p>
