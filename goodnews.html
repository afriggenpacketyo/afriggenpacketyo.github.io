          <p>The USDA's demand that states turn over sensitive data about SNAP recipients is on hold after a lawsuit alleged the directive violated federal privacy laws. The USDA had requested data including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses of SNAP applicants and recipients over the past five years. The agency cited President Donald Trump's executive order on eliminating information silos as justification for the request. The USDA's decision to pause data collection comes as it develops a new Systems of Record Notice to comply with Privacy Act requirements.</p>

          <p>Jamie Smith's recent performance in the third ODI against the West Indies has underscored England's current cricket strategy, emphasizing batters who can perform under pressure. Despite other contenders, Smith was seen as the likely candidate due to his alignment with the 'Bazball' approach. His ability to score quickly and effectively, especially against challenging deliveries, demonstrates his value to the team. England's focus on Smith reflects their broader aim of building a team capable of excelling in high-pressure situations.</p>

          <p>Labor groups and elected officials are advocating for a minimum wage of at least $25 an hour in Los Angeles County. The campaign aims to address the steep increase in the cost of living, with advocates arguing that a person living in L.A. County needs to earn around $28 an hour to cover basic expenses. The proposal is expected to face opposition from business groups, who warn that it could lead to closures and job losses. The campaign has the backing of L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, who supports an across-the-board minimum wage increase.</p>

          <p>The UK has been exempted from President Donald Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. While the order raises import taxes for U.S. firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May, which will eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum, has not yet taken effect. The UK government has stated its commitment to protecting British business and jobs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care for transgender inmates, despite President Trump's executive order to halt funding for such care. The judge allowed a class-action lawsuit challenging the order and directed the bureau to provide hormone therapy and accommodations. The ruling does not require surgical care related to gender transitions. The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as a reminder that transgender people have constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Mondelƒìz International, the maker of Oreo cookies, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi in the U.S., accusing the supermarket chain of copying the packaging of its snacks.

The lawsuit includes side-by-side comparisons of Mondelƒìz products with Aldi's versions. Aldi UK stated that it is not involved in the lawsuit, as it operates as a separate business from Aldi US.</p>
