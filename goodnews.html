          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates, and subsequently raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance. The company's comparable sales grew by 5%, driven by increases in average ticket and transactions, reflecting effective long-term strategies and consistent execution. This positive performance comes as Dick's prepares to acquire rival Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, a move expected to close in September, which will make the combined entity the largest seller of athletic footwear in the U.S. CEO Lauren Hobart noted that consumers are not balking at "small-level" price increases implemented to offset tariffs, and the company sees growth across all key segments.

          <p>As the UK's state pension age continues to rise, potentially reaching 70, many individuals face the challenge of working longer in physically demanding or mentally taxing jobs. This article explores strategies for maintaining physical and mental health, and motivation, when nearing or past traditional retirement ages. Experts advise consistent moderate exercise, strength training, and activities like yoga or tai chi for physical well-being, noting that early-life fitness is key for longevity. Additionally, prioritizing brain health through puzzles, music, and socialising, alongside focusing on mental health through self-care and work-life balance, are crucial. The article also touches on the emotional impact of bereavement and the need for workplace adjustments to support older workers.</p>

          <p>New York City is conducting its decennial Trees Count, a census where volunteers and technology map and assess the health of the city's urban forest. This year, the focus is on 150,000 landscaped park trees, with street trees being scanned by Lidar technology, expanding on previous efforts. Volunteers, like those in Marcus Garvey Park, meticulously identify species, measure trunks, and grade tree health, contributing to a comprehensive interactive database. The data informs the parks department's initiatives, including increasing canopy cover to 30% by 2035 and mitigating heat burdens in underserved neighborhoods. This article highlights the community's dedication to environmental stewardship, the importance of tree diversity for urban resilience, and the sense of shared purpose it fosters among New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock fluctuated after its latest earnings report, which showed a robust 56% surge in sales to $46.74 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, slightly exceeding analyst estimates. CEO Jensen Huang touted "full steam" AI infrastructure spending, projecting $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade, indicating immense opportunity and continued growth in the AI revolution. However, concerns about Nvidia's future in China clouded the positive results, particularly after the Trump administration blocked sales of its H20 chip. While a deal to restart sales by giving 15% of sales to the Chinese government is unfinalized, the company's guidance for the current quarter does not include any H20 shipments, highlighting ongoing geopolitical risks and uncertainty.

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, showing a modest sales recovery with comparable sales rising 1.6%, its highest growth in three years. Despite this positive trend, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business in the back half of the year. CEO Corie Barry noted strong customer response to back-to-school sales events and innovation-driven purchases, particularly in computing and gaming with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. However, the company anticipates some shoppers may delay purchases in the third quarter due to holiday deal expectations and ongoing tariff concerns. The article highlights Best Buy's efforts to spur growth through a new third-party marketplace and in-store experiences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. GDP Growth Revised Upward to 3.3% in Second Quarter, Masking Underlying Weakness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster-than-initially-estimated annual pace of 3.3% in the second quarter, bouncing back from a first-quarter slump, according to new government data. The Commerce Department's upward revision was primarily driven by increased business investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property, as well as consumer spending. However, economists note that much of this strength was a "mirage," reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in Q1 due to impending tariffs. The overall average growth rate for the first half of the year was only 1.4%, with weak private-sector demand outside of AI-related investment. Concerns about the economy persist amid a slowdown in hiring, leading investors to anticipate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts to shore up economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England captain Zoe Aldcroft has been ruled out of the remainder of the Women's Rugby World Cup pool stage due to a knee injury sustained in the opening win against the United States. This marks her first absence from the matchday squad since being appointed captain in January, posing a challenge for the team. Former captain Marlie Packer will take over as skipper for the upcoming game against Samoa, as coach John Mitchell makes 13 changes to the team, resting several regular starters to give everyone game time. The Red Roses, currently on an impressive 28-game winning streak, will need to adapt without their captain as they continue their tournament campaign, aiming to build on their strong opening performance.</p>

          <h2>Cryptocurrency Market Sees Potential Shift in Liquidity from Bitcoin to Altcoins</h2>

          <p>Market watchers observe a potential shift in cryptocurrency liquidity, with Bitcoin investors moving assets into altcoins like Ethereum and Solana, as Bitcoin's market dominance dips from a recent high of nearly 65%. While Bitcoin's price has retreated, Ethereum and Solana have shown gains, and an Ethereum ETF has seen significant asset inflows compared to its Bitcoin counterpart. However, other metrics, like CoinMarketCap's altcoin season index, remain inconclusive, showing a sideways trend. The article suggests a true altcoin season would require fundamental shifts like surging transaction volumes and increased developer activity on smart contract platforms. It also predicts a milder "crypto winter" than previous cycles, attributing it to the calming effect of ETFs and crypto-friendly government policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Alabama Death Row Inmate Granted New Trial After 31 Years Due to DNA Evidence</h2>

          <p>An Alabama death row inmate, Christopher Barbour, has been granted a new trial after 31 years, following recent forensic tests that revealed another man's DNA on the victim's body. Barbour was convicted in 1992 for the murder of Thelma Bishop Roberts, based largely on a confession he later recanted, alleging police coercion and physical assault. A federal judge ordered the new trial, citing a prosecution violation of Barbour's constitutional rights by failing to disclose initial forensics notes that excluded him as the DNA source. This article highlights significant questions about the original conviction and the potential for a wrongful conviction, offering Barbour the opportunity to argue his innocence to a jury. The state plans to appeal the decision.</p>
