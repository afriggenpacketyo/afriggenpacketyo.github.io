          <p>British luxury brand Burberry is slated to return to the U.K.'s prestigious FTSE 100 index after being relegated a year ago. This promotion follows early signs of a successful turnaround strategy under its new CEO, which includes cost-cutting measures and a renewed focus on the brand's classic pieces. Despite a recent 1% dip in first-quarter sales, performance was better than analysts feared, showing an uptick in U.S. and European markets. The move is part of a quarterly reshuffling at the London Stock Exchange, which will also see homebuilder Taylor Wimpey and Unite Group exit the top index.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent tentative agreement securing boarding pay for Air Canada flight attendants has intensified the push for similar compensation among their U.S. counterparts. For decades, many North American flight attendants have not been paid for work performed during boarding and deplaning, as their wages traditionally start only when the aircraft doors close. Unions representing thousands of U.S. flight attendants at airlines like Frontier and PSA Airlines are now in negotiations, citing the Air Canada deal as a new standard. They argue that unpaid ground work is unsustainable, with some employees facing severe financial hardship despite working long hours.</p>

          <p>The average value of a National Football League franchise has climbed to $7.65 billion, marking an 18% increase from the previous year, according to CNBC's 2025 valuations. The Dallas Cowboys remain the most valuable team at $12.5 billion, followed by the Los Angeles Rams at $10.7 billion. This growth is driven by substantial national revenue from media rights, licensing, and sponsorships, which are shared equally among all 32 teams. The league's financial strength is further bolstered by recent deals and a rule change allowing private equity investments, which has significantly increased team sale prices.

Sales of mutual funds, bonds, and other equity-linked products surged as capital flowed into the city's markets. According to a survey by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of customers trading these products increased by 28% compared to the previous year, reaching 1.2 million. An SFC official attributed the remarkable growth to the dedication of financial firms and the strong trust investors have placed in Hong Kong's markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The site, which attracted over 1.6 billion visits in the past year from users primarily in the UK and US, provided pirated access to major sports events. Two men were arrested in Egypt, where authorities seized equipment and uncovered a shell company allegedly used to launder millions in advertising revenue. While broadcasters praised the takedown, analysts caution that the high cost of legal sports subscriptions continues to fuel a persistent piracy problem.</p>

          <h2>Argument Emerges for Introducing Smartphones to Children as Early as Age Three</h2>

          <p>Challenging the popular "Wait Until 8th" movement, some experts argue for introducing smartphones to children as young as three to foster digital literacy under heavy parental guidance. This approach involves gradually adding functionality, starting with a locked-down device containing only a family photo album and later adding features like a camera, audiobooks, and eventually texting. The goal is to make technology a continuous conversation, teaching children how to use these ubiquitous tools safely and intentionally. Proponents believe this method is more effective than withholding phones until an arbitrary age, which can make the devices a "forbidden fruit" and leave teens unprepared for online risks.</p>

          <h2>Rare Fisher, Unseen for Nearly 200 Years, Discovered in Ohio</h2>

          <p>A creature thought to have been eliminated from Ohio for nearly two centuries has been rediscovered, signaling a positive development for the state's biodiversity. A retired veterinarian in Ashtabula County found a fisher, a member of the weasel family, that had unfortunately been struck by a car. While the animal did not survive, it was found to be pregnant, providing crucial evidence that the species is successfully breeding in the region after its long absence. This follows a small number of rare sightings over the past decade and is seen as part of a broader trend of wildlife, like bald eagles and wild turkeys, returning to the area.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Evidence Behind Creatine Supplement Health Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a popular supplement long used by athletes, is gaining mainstream attention for a range of purported health benefits, but scientific evidence varies in strength. Decades of research confirm that creatine supplements can effectively help build lean muscle mass and improve performance in short, high-intensity exercises when combined with resistance training. Newer, but less conclusive, research is exploring its potential benefits for bone health, cognitive function during sleep deprivation, and blood sugar regulation. Experts consider creatine monohydrate safe for most adults but note that up to 30% of people may not respond to supplementation and that it is not a "magic bullet" for health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to increased federal immigration enforcement, California's legislature is advancing several bills to strengthen protections for immigrants at sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. One bill would require schools to notify families of any federal immigration operations on campus, while another would bar agents from nonpublic school areas without a judicial warrant. A third bill aims to prevent healthcare facilities from disclosing a patient's immigration status to authorities without a court order. These measures, now heading to the governor, are intended to ensure schools and hospitals remain safe spaces where all residents can access services without fear of deportation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is asking for public feedback on a comprehensive plan to address its struggling parks system, which recently ranked 90th out of 100 large U.S. cities. A detailed needs-assessment study highlights chronic underfunding, a shrinking workforce, and a $2 billion deferred maintenance backlog. The report found that L.A. invests significantly less per capita in its parks than other major cities like Chicago and San Francisco. To reverse this decline, the plan proposes strategies such as amending the city charter for more funding, creating new revenue streams, and putting a new fundraising initiative on the 2026 ballot.</p>

          <p>A juvenile bald eagle recently visited the Big Bear nest of famed eagle couple Jackie and Shadow, leading observers to believe it may be their daughter, Gizmo, who fledged earlier this summer. The young eagle shared several distinct features with Gizmo, including a dark tail, a gap in its left-wing feathers, and a unique upturned beak described as a "Mona Lisa smile." While it is common for eaglets to return to the nest shortly after their first flight, a return nearly six months later is considered unusual. The peaceful visit has thrilled thousands of fans who follow the eagles' lives via a 24-hour webcam.</p>

          <p>As his iconic detective series featuring Easy Rawlins marks its 35th anniversary, author Walter Mosley is releasing the 17th installment, "Gray Dawn." The series has provided a unique lens on Los Angeles's evolution, chronicling the city's social and racial dynamics from the post-WWII era into the 1970s. In the new novel, an older Easy Rawlins navigates a world of Black militants, crooked law enforcement, and family crises, reflecting the seismic shifts of the time. Mosley's work is celebrated by fellow authors like S.A. Cosby and Steph Cha for giving a voice to the voiceless and capturing the essence of a changing America through his protagonist's eyes.</p>
