          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will be honored with a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his refusal to endorse false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Pence, as Vice President, resisted pressure from Trump to overturn the election results during the Congressional certification on January 6, 2021, despite facing public criticism and threats, including chants of "hang Mike Pence" during the Capitol riot. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for prioritizing the constitutional transfer of presidential power, a decision that has distanced him from Trump and the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>A Spitfire aircraft made an emergency crash-landing in a field in West Hythe, Kent, just days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day. The plane, owned by Fly A Spitfire, experienced a "precautionary landing" due to what witnesses described as engine misfiring. Both the pilot and passenger were uninjured, and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is investigating the cause of the incident. It remains unclear whether the flight was connected to the upcoming VE Day celebrations or if the plane was practicing for a flypast.</p>

          <p>Following a lackluster fight between Sa√∫l √Ålvarez and William Scull, questions arise whether √Ålvarez's upcoming fight against Terence Crawford will be more entertaining. Crawford, though a highly skilled boxer, will move up two weight divisions to challenge √Ålvarez, raising concerns about his size disadvantage. Despite Crawford's talent, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez predicts √Ålvarez will win by knockout, similar to √Ålvarez's fight against Amir Khan, where Khan performed well until the size difference became too much. With the event promoted by Turki Alalshikh and Dana White, some suspect the fight will be another mismatch, continuing the trend of unequal matchups in √Ålvarez's recent fights.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment guru, announced his plan to step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era. Buffett's success with value investing transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate, influencing generations of financiers. Over six decades, Buffett amassed a personal fortune of $168 billion by buying "wonderful businesses at fair prices," and his legacy includes a vast array of companies like BNSF railroad and Geico. While he acknowledges luck played a role, Buffett's discipline, knowledge, and long-term investment strategy have made him an icon of American capitalism.</p>
