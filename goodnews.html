        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing insights from his book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel argues that true happiness stems from contentment rather than the accumulation of wealth. He posits that happiness is the gap between one's expectations and circumstances, suggesting that individuals with modest means but low expectations can feel richer than billionaires who constantly desire more. Using his grandmother-in-law as an example of someone who lived happily on the verge of poverty, the article emphasizes appreciating the ordinary and recognizing that psychological wealth is achieved when one feels they have enough. This perspective challenges the common belief that increased spending and material possessions lead to greater life satisfaction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has significantly increased its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This optimistic revision is driven by strong demand for AI-related goods like semiconductors and servers, front-loading of U.S. imports ahead of tariffs, and favorable macroeconomic conditions in major economies. However, the WTO has downgraded its outlook for 2026, slashing expected growth from 1.8% to just 0.5%, citing a cooling global economy and the full impact of trade tariffs. The organization warns that the spread of trade-restrictive measures remains a key downside risk to its projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised technology, though the announcement was overshadowed by anticipation for a more significant product launch. The company had previously shared cryptic teaser clips on social media, sparking widespread speculation among investors and fans about a potential new vehicle, such as a lower-cost model or the long-promised next-generation Roadster. With its auto sales in a slump, Tesla has been working to pivot investor focus toward its future as a robotics and autonomous driving company. The timing of the reveal comes as the company faces increased competition and an aging vehicle lineup.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has purchased additional shares of GE Vernova, expressing confidence in the company's long-term prospects, particularly due to the growing demand for power driven by artificial intelligence. The purchase comes after the stock has traded sideways following a significant surge in July. The club's rationale is that the massive expansion of AI data centers, such as those announced by OpenAI, will create a substantial need for new power generation and grid solutions, areas where GE Vernova is a key player. Despite expected softness in its onshore wind business, the investment thesis focuses on the strength of its gas turbine and electrification segments. (not investment advice)</p>

EU officials have stated that China's excess steel production is a long-standing and worsening issue that poses a significant threat to European producers. The proposed measures, which require approval from the European Parliament and Council, are designed to replace an existing safeguard system set to expire in 2026. This initiative signals the EU's intent to take a more assertive stance on trade defense to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of its domestic steel market.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Ukraine's Evolving Military Strategy Reveals Focus on Technology and Manpower Preservation</h2>

          <p>Ukraine's military is adapting to a war of attrition against Russia by leveraging technology and implementing new tactics to conserve its limited manpower. Commanders are increasingly relying on a sophisticated network of aerial and ground drones for reconnaissance, strikes, resupply, and medical evacuations to minimize direct contact between troops. The strategy also involves more precise artillery use and systematic troop rotations to maintain morale and combat effectiveness. This shift reflects a new confidence that Ukraine can sustain a long-term defense by inflicting steady losses on Russian forces while carefully protecting its own soldiers from the brutal, high-casualty fighting on the front lines.</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed by more than 225% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's decision to block the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed commitment to resource development aimed at securing U.S. supply chains. The project remains controversial, with opponents raising concerns about its environmental impact on the Alaskan wilderness and local communities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 continues to reach new record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to look beyond the popular index to ensure proper diversification. They warn that the market capitalization-weighted nature of the S&P 500 creates an illusion of safety, as it is heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, making portfolios vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. To mitigate this risk, advisors suggest considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. The goal is to build a more balanced portfolio that can better withstand periods of underperformance that occasionally affect the large-cap index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is expected to select a contractor as soon as this week to design and build the U.S. Navy's next-generation stealth fighter, known as the F/A-XX. This multi-billion dollar program, central to countering China's military advancements, will replace the aging F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fleet. The decision to proceed, reportedly made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, comes after months of delay caused by a funding dispute between the Pentagon and Congress. Defense giants Boeing and Northrop Grumman are the final competitors for the contract to produce the advanced carrier-based aircraft, which is slated to enter service in the 2030s.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that startups are staying private for significantly longer periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely attributed to the massive growth in alternative capital sources, including venture capital, private equity, and sovereign wealth funds, which provide ample funding without the regulatory burdens of being a public company. As a result, companies are maturing and reaching much larger revenue figures before their initial public offerings. While the IPO market is showing signs of a rebound, the availability of private capital has fundamentally changed the traditional path to public markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unusually large swarms of ladybirds have been reported across the UK, with many finding their way into homes. Experts explain that this is a normal seasonal behavior driven by recent weather patterns. After a cool start to October, a spell of unseasonably warm and sunny weather has prompted the insects to become active and seek sheltered, warm locations to hibernate for the winter, a state known as diapause. The boom in the ladybird population is also linked to the record-breaking warm spring and summer, which led to a surge in aphids, their primary food source. The invasive harlequin ladybird is the species most commonly found clustering inside houses.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have proposed the creation of a global, shared mega-constellation of satellites powered by artificial intelligence. The project, named the Open and Shared Sustainable Mega Constellation (OSSMC), aims to address two key challenges: the increasing congestion of low Earth orbit and the need for equitable access to space resources. With over a million satellites already filed for launch worldwide, primarily by private companies like SpaceX, the proposal from China offers a collaborative solution. The project's lead scientist stated that this initiative represents a "China solution" for building a shared future for humanity in space systems, promoting sustainability and cooperation over competition.</p>
