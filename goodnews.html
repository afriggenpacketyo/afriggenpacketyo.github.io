          <p>The town of Clarksdale, Mississippi, is experiencing a resurgence in attention thanks to the success of Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners*, which earned over $300 million globally. Clarksdale, known as the starting place for blues legends like Sam Cooke and Muddy Waters, has faced economic struggles similar to other small towns in the US South. Coogler held six free screenings in Clarksdale after a local campaign led by Tyler Yarbrough, allowing residents to see their town represented with careful detail in the 1932-set film. The movie is expected to significantly boost tourism and provide economic benefits, as visitors seek to experience the history and culture depicted in the film, bringing much needed revenue to the local economy. The movie serves as a means for the town's residents to grasp the history that lives on the streets of Clarksdale, preserving the rich cultural heritage for generations to come.</p>

          <p>Mexican-American singer √Ångela Aguilar is using her platform to advocate for immigrant rights, defying industry norms that discourage discussing politics and religion. During Billboard Women in Music, Aguilar delivered a powerful speech in favor of immigrants and performed alongside Harmony Project, a choir of immigrant children. She expressed concern over the current situation for immigrants in the United States, emphasizing the importance of speaking out against injustice. Aguilar also suggested visiting the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) website for information on immigrant rights and how to handle potential detentions, suggesting that she might eventually incorporate social issues into her music, citing La Santa Cecilia's song 'El Hielo (ICE)' as inspiration. Aguilar's commitment extends beyond words, she actively works to raise awareness and provide resources for immigrant communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This initiative, part of the government's strategic defense review, aims to create an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up. The factories are expected to support the production of over 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, creating approximately 1,800 new jobs across the country, strengthening the armed forces and boosting British jobs. The investment comes in response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions, increasing production of artillery shells, next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) and long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into force across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment by targeting a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Shops and supermarkets are prohibited from stocking disposable vapes, though rechargeable and refillable devices remain available. Retailers violating the ban face fines, with the goal of reducing the appeal of vaping among young people, as vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking but has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known. While experts predict the ban will have a significant impact, they also emphasize the need for further regulation to fully address youth vaping.</p>
