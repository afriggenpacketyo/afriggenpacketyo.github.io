          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared former President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The panel of judges found that the order directly contradicts the clear language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to "all persons born in the United States." This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the policy, which sought to deny citizenship to many children of undocumented immigrants, though the policy is currently on hold.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly surpassing market expectations. The surge is attributed to robust demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in AI hardware used by companies like Nvidia. The company's dominance in the HBM market has been a key driver of its success, and it anticipates continued strong demand for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains favorable to sellers, some realtors observe a subtle shift that may provide a slight advantage to buyers. An increase in housing inventory, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, is a key factor, though record-high median sale prices persist due to limited supply from homeowners with low-interest mortgages. Market conditions vary significantly by location, with some areas in Texas and Florida favoring buyers while markets in the Northeast remain highly competitive for sellers.

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a crucial extra-time winner against Germany, securing her team's place in the Euro 2025 final against England. Her performance is particularly remarkable as she was hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began, causing her to miss the start of Spain's campaign. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner's skillful goal in a tightly contested match highlights her return to form and her importance to the Spanish squad as they seek their first Women's Euro title.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal obligation to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. Responding to a request led by the island nation of Vanuatu, the court affirmed that existing international laws and treaties compel nations to act with due diligence and provide reparations for climate-related damages. While not legally binding, the opinion sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence climate litigation and international policy negotiations worldwide.</p>
