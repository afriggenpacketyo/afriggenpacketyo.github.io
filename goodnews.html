          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, reflecting the growing influence of internet and social media culture on the English language. Among the new entries are viral terms such as "skibidi," a nonsensical word from a YouTube series, and "tradwife," a portmanteau for "traditional wife." Other additions capture modern work-life trends, including "mouse jiggler," a device to feign computer activity, and "broligarchy," describing a small group of powerful male tech leaders. Lexical experts at the dictionary note that they only include words they believe demonstrate lasting power and significance in everyday communication.</p>

          <h2>Researcher Claims to Find Oldest Written Reference to Moses on Ancient Egyptian Inscriptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:00:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American-Israeli researcher, Michael S. Bar-Ron, has proposed a new analysis of 3,800-year-old inscriptions from an ancient Egyptian mining site that may contain the earliest known written reference to Moses. The Proto-Sinaitic etchings, found at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai desert, date to between 1800 and 1600 B.C., centuries before the Bible was written. Bar-Ron suggests two phrases translate to "This is from Moses" and "Declaration of Moses," potentially linking the biblical figure to Semitic laborers who resisted the worship of the pagan goddess Ba`alat. If verified through peer review, this discovery would provide the first physical evidence of Moses outside of religious texts.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously considered the last country without a national soccer team, made its historic international debut in a match held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese diaspora community of around 15,000 people, who turned out to enthusiastically support the new team. Despite a 4-0 loss to the US Virgin Islands, the event was celebrated as a major milestone, fostering a sense of pride and representation for the community. The team, which had only five training sessions together, later scored its first-ever goals in a subsequent match, marking a significant moment for the island nation.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick, leading to a potential breakthrough in a cold case from 1967. Authorities recovered the severely deteriorated vehicle and found human remains inside. Using the car's VIN, investigators identified it as belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing nearly 60 years ago. While the remains await formal identification, officials believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family. The fisherman, Brody Loch, described the discovery as "100% luck," expressing hope that it will finally bring closure to the family.</p>

          <p>A new, extensively researched biography titled "Baldwin: A Love Story" by Nicholas Boggs offers a deep dive into the life of writer James Baldwin, positioning it to become the new standard for Baldwin studies. The book meticulously connects his literary masterpieces, such as "Giovanni's Room" and "The Fire Next Time," to his personal search for love and identity as a Black, gay man. It explores his formative relationships, his time as a transatlantic nomad to escape American racism, and his crucial role in the civil rights movement. The biography argues that Baldwin's art was fueled by his complex love affairs and his unwavering commitment to exposing hard truths about race and sexuality in America.</p>

          <p>The creative team behind the acclaimed series "The Bear" discusses the making of "Napkins," an Emmy-nominated episode from Season 3 that focuses on the backstory of line cook Tina Marrero. Directed by co-star Ayo Edebiri, the episode explores Tina's struggles before joining the restaurant, a narrative that resonated deeply with actress Liza Colón-Zayas, who drew on her own experiences as a veteran performer. The episode culminates in a pivotal, emotionally raw scene between Tina and Jon Bernthal's Mikey, which the actors and director approached with restraint to capture a powerful, life-changing connection between two strangers. The piece highlights the show's tradition of dedicating episodes to develop its supporting characters.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk jumped nearly 5% after its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a serious liver disease. Wegovy is now the first GLP-1 class drug authorized for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a condition affecting an estimated 5% of U.S. adults. This approval expands the drug's applications beyond weight loss and diabetes, strengthening its position in the metabolic disease market. The decision was based on a clinical trial where Wegovy showed a statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. (not investment advice)</p>

The race is unusual, featuring a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform.

          <p>Helsinki, the capital of Finland, has successfully achieved zero traffic-related deaths in the past year, making it one of the largest cities to reach this milestone. City officials attribute the success to a comprehensive strategy focused on reducing speed limits, with many streets now capped at 30 kilometers per hour (19 mph). This is part of the EU's "Vision Zero" program, which aims to eliminate road fatalities by 2050. Helsinki's approach also involves using data to identify and redesign dangerous intersections, improving infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, and enhancing enforcement through a network of speed cameras, demonstrating a model for urban safety.</p>
