          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a compelling showdown between the world's top two ranked players, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, renewing a rivalry that is defining modern tennis. This meeting comes just weeks after their classic five-set match at the French Open, which Alcaraz won. The two young stars have dominated the last six Grand Slam tournaments, and their contrasting on-court personalities—the expressive Alcaraz and the stoic Sinner—add to the drama. The match is seen as a significant moment for the sport, potentially heralding a new long-term rivalry akin to those of the "Big Three."</p>

          <p>British boxer Hamzah Sheeraz delivered a career-defining performance by stopping Edgar Berlanga in the fifth round of their super middleweight fight at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Sheeraz, making his debut at 168lbs, dropped Berlanga twice in the fourth round before the referee intervened early in the fifth. This decisive victory establishes the 26-year-old as a serious contender in the division, potentially setting up future high-profile bouts against top names like Canelo Álvarez. The event also featured Shakur Stevenson retaining his lightweight title in the co-main event.</p>

          <p>Bronny James showcased his potential during a Lakers' NBA Summer League game, scoring 14 points in a victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. His father, LeBron James, was present courtside, actively coaching and encouraging him throughout the game, at one point yelling for him to "get downhill more." Bronny responded to his father's advice with confident plays, including a key three-pointer in the fourth quarter. The performance highlighted not only his skills and decision-making on the court but also the unique dynamic of being mentored in real-time by one of basketball's all-time greats.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>

          <p>A new study offers preliminary evidence that could ease concerns in India about China's dam construction on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, known as the Brahmaputra in India. Contrary to fears that the dams would cause droughts, data collected downstream from two existing Chinese dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, suggests the opposite effect. The research indicates that since 2014, water flows during the dry season have significantly increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This finding hints that China's massive new dam project in Tibet might regulate water flow, potentially benefiting downstream regions during drier periods.</p>

          <p>China's space sector is experiencing a boom driven by private investment, which is projected to constitute 45% of all aerospace investment by 2025. This growth is fueled by technological advances, lower costs, and state support for private enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones in rocket technology. The global space economy is forecast to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035, moving beyond state-led missions to include commercial activities like satellite constellations and resource mining. This article argues that Hong Kong is well-positioned to contribute to and benefit from this burgeoning industry as it develops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Look at Why Boeing Discontinued Production of the C-17 Globemaster III Cargo Jet</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, an iconic military transport aircraft, ceased production in 2015 primarily due to a lack of demand and significant budget cuts. Despite its unique capabilities, such as carrying massive payloads and landing on short, undeveloped runways, the U.S. Air Force had completed its purchase order by 2013. The 2011 Budget Control Act led to defense spending reductions, making the expensive C-17 program a target for cuts. Ironically, recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the versatile cargo hauler, prompting reports that Boeing is now considering resuming its production.</p>
