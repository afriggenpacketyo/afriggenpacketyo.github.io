          <p>Former Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden speaks out about her recent firing by President Trump, describing how she received an email without prior notification or explanation. Hayden believes her dismissal is part of a broader effort to diminish public access to information and inspiration, emphasizing the importance of libraries as bastions of democracy. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated Hayden did not fit the needs of the American people, citing concerns about DEI initiatives and inappropriate books. Hayden responded by expressing concern that there may not have been an awareness of what the Library of Congress does, clarifying its primary function is to fulfill research requests from members of Congress.</p>

          <p>This article explains the structure and deployment of the US National Guard, typically used for disaster relief and internal security. However, President Trump has overridden California's governor to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles due to immigration protests. The National Guard consists of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, with approximately 419,000 reservists. Command typically rests with the state governor unless federalized by the US President, who cited national security for the LA deployment, a move criticized by Governor Newsom as deliberately inflaming tensions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the threat of American "peaceful evolution" aimed at subverting the Communist Party in China has receded due to President Trump's policies. The author reflects on Mao Zedong's warnings about American imperialists seeking to subjugate China by promoting Western values and inciting dissent. However, the US has shifted away from nation-building and lecturing on governance, leading to a diminished perception of this threat. China has emerged as a major economic power, challenging America's superpower status.</p>

          <p>This poem, "Under a Supermoon" by Arthur Sze, reflects on the beauty of minutiae and the exploding nature of life. The speaker contrasts the desire to explore space or the ocean depths with a focus on simple earthly pleasures, such as the scent of split pi√±on and juniper. The poem references Blake's idea that persistence in folly leads to wisdom. Ultimately, the speaker finds joy in the darkening craters of the moon, the smell of apples, and the realization that life is full of exploding stars.</p>

Passengers endured a roughly 3-hour bus journey from Rome to Naples. American Airlines apologized for the disruption to their travel plans.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers, with a projected shortage of 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028.

Companies like GE Aerospace are ramping up hiring and offering on-the-job training, with base pay averaging $80,000 to $90,000 annually.

Both the men's and women's teams swept the Chess Olympiad last year, and Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest-ever world champion at age 18. This shift is attributed to grassroots teaching, school support, and parental encouragement.
