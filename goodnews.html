          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his Pentagon role after six months of service, a move he described as planned and amicable. During his tenure, Fulcher advised on personnel and policy, contributing to reviews of acquisition programs and efforts to streamline IT procurement. His departure is one of several from Hegseth's office since January, though officials characterize them as standard transitions. Fulcher praised the work being done by Hegseth and President Trump to revitalize the military's "warrior ethos."</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced that the number of individuals reported missing after the severe July 4 floods has been reduced from nearly 100 to just three. This significant decrease is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local and state agencies who successfully verified that most of the unaccounted-for individuals were safe. At its peak, over 160 people were listed as missing in the county. The statewide death toll from the flooding event stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new law aimed at stopping violent individuals who are planning mass casualty attacks but lack a specific ideological motive required for terrorism charges. The legislation, prompted in part by the Southport attack, would mirror existing anti-terror laws, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts like researching targets. This move is intended to close a legal gap, ensuring that the plotting of mass violence by lone attackers is treated with the same seriousness as terrorism, even without a clear political or religious cause.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental reset amidst a season-long slump. Betts' batting average has fallen to a career-low .241, and his performance has not improved since the All-Star break, prompting the decision. Roberts hopes that having Betts watch a game without the pressure to perform will be beneficial for his mindset and mechanics. The manager stated the decision was his own and that Betts' return to the lineup will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in the UK over shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with proponents arguing it could help prevent learning loss and ease childcare burdens for working parents. Some school districts are already adopting a five-week summer break with a longer two-week half-term in October. However, the proposal is divisive; while some parents are in favor, many teachers oppose it, viewing the long break as essential for recharging and planning. The potential impact on holiday costs is also a key factor, with uncertainty over whether a shorter summer would raise or lower prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a shift in public mindset from risk-averse saving to investing, suggesting that savers are missing out on financial rewards. The government plans to encourage people with money in low-interest cash accounts to consider stocks and shares, potentially through targeted messages and new ad campaigns. While a proposal to cut the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) has faced backlash, the idea has not been completely ruled out. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that pushing inexperienced savers into volatile markets could backfire. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike their predecessors, these clubs often have a more relaxed, contemporary ethos and prioritize personal accomplishment over family pedigree for membership.

While some authentic photos of Trump and Epstein together do exist from past events, this particular viral picture is a fabrication.
