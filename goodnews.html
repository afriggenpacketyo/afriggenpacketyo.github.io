          <p>Virginia Democrats have chosen Chris Jones as their attorney general nominee to compete against Republican Jason Miyares in November's election. The Democratic primary for lieutenant governor remains undecided, while Abigail Spanberger will run for governor against Winsome Earle-Sears. Virginia's elections, held the year after a presidential election, are viewed as indicators of voter sentiment before midterm elections, with analysts closely watching for signals regarding President Trump's influence. While Democrats have historically held a strong position in Virginia, recent elections suggest a shift towards swing-state status, although the party of the sitting president typically faces challenges in Virginia's statewide races.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai have signed an action plan to enable mainland Chinese companies to utilize Hong Kong's capital market for their global growth initiatives. The agreement, signed at the annual Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, aims to enhance connectivity between the two cities by expanding the Connect programme to include more equities, bonds, ETFs, and gold. Additionally, the plan focuses on cross-border settlements and the use of the digital yuan, with Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po emphasizing the plan's role in supporting the "go global" drive by mainland companies. This is the first agreement signed since the forum began in 2008, highlighting the importance of financial cooperation between Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals applying for new passports, renewing expired ones, or changing their name or gender designation can choose the gender they identify with, including selecting "X" on the application form. This ruling expands on a previous decision and is in response to a lawsuit filed by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs who claimed the policy was discriminatory. The White House has criticized the ruling, while the Justice Department has appealed Kobick's previous decision, and the State Department has declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.</p>

          <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan asserts that President Trump's leadership has resulted in the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the "vast majority" of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., while under Trump, none were released. He advocates for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to complete the job and initiate a large-scale deportation operation. Homan's statements highlight a trend of decreased illegal immigration under Trump's policies, attributing it to stricter border enforcement measures.</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot companies are offering salaries more than three times the national urban average to attract top engineers and AI talent, highlighting a growing talent shortage. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with experienced engineers earning up to 38,489 yuan. This contrasts with the subdued hiring landscape in China, where the job market faces pressure from slowing economic growth and corporate earnings.

          <p>Scientists predict a potential boom in endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters in UK waters due to rising ocean temperatures causing species to shift habitats. A study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, revealing that the North Sea could become a biodiversity hotspot. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis should guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as their habitats change.</p>
