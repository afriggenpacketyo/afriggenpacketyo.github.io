          <p>Australians are voting in a general election, grappling with inflation, housing affordability, and relations with the United States and China, according to the New York Times article. Voters express concerns about the rising cost of living and question whether either major party offers substantial solutions. The opposition leader's attempts to mirror Trump's rhetoric have been met with resistance, as voters prioritize domestic economic issues over culture wars. The trend of voters shifting away from major parties towards independents and minor parties indicates a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo, but the article still expects the current prime minister to win.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies from a man who injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, according to the BBC article. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes. This could be a significant advancement, as current antivenoms are species-specific. Friede's motivation was to help those in remote areas who die from snakebites, and researchers are optimistic about the potential of this new antivenom.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms aimed at cutting government spending, modernizing the state, and consolidating power, according to DW. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. These changes are intended to make the state more agile and redirect resources towards economic growth, but some analysts suggest they may also serve to centralize power under the Communist Party leadership. The reforms come amid external pressures, including potential US tariffs, and a desire to address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign.</p>
