          <p>While a majority of U.S. adults dream of being their own boss, common obstacles like financial insecurity, fear of failure, and a lack of business knowledge often prevent them from starting. Business experts suggest that these hurdles can be overcome with strategic planning and a shift in mindset. They recommend starting with a smaller financial safety net, such as three to six months of expenses, and testing a business idea as a side hustle first. Additionally, building a solid business plan and seeking mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs can provide the necessary foundation and confidence to launch successfully.</p>

          <p>Technology firm Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium involved in a framework deal aimed at allowing TikTok to continue its U.S. operations. The negotiations between the Trump administration and China are complex, with the final structure still unclear but set to include a mix of new and existing investors. This potential agreement follows years of national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and its control over user data and algorithms. Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison has ties to President Trump, has previously partnered with TikTok to manage U.S. user data.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has internally evaluated its models for "frontier risks," which are potential large-scale threats to public safety, according to a source familiar with the matter. This move aligns with Beijing's recent push to increase safety awareness within its rapidly growing AI industry. Unlike their U.S. counterparts such as OpenAI and Anthropic, Chinese AI companies have not publicly released the results of such safety assessments. The evaluation signifies a growing global focus on the potential dangers of highly advanced artificial intelligence systems and the need for robust safety protocols.</p>

          <p>As winter approaches, European Union gas reserves are currently just over 80% full, a level lower than the past few years but still considered a solid buffer against potential supply disruptions. Since reducing its reliance on Russian energy, the EU has diversified its sources, primarily turning to liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S., Norway, and Qatar. While the immediate energy crisis has subsided, the bloc remains vulnerable to geopolitical pressures, including potential U.S. tariffs on countries trading Russian energy. Analysts believe this winter's energy situation is stable but not entirely without risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that he is confident a trade deal with China can be reached before a November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs. He noted that recent talks have become increasingly productive and suggested that China now sees a deal as possible. The Trump administration is aiming to significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which is on pace to decline this year. The ongoing negotiations represent a critical point in the economic relationship between the two global powers, with the potential to either stabilize or escalate trade tensions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back as far as 12,000 years, across various sites in Southeast Asia. A new study suggests that hunter-gatherer communities practiced a form of mummification by smoke-drying bodies over a fire. This process, evidenced by cut and burn marks on the remains, would have preserved the deceased, allowing relatives to maintain a connection with their ancestors. The findings push back the timeline of intentional mummification by thousands of years, predating the well-known practices of ancient Egypt and the Chinchorro people of South America.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will create a legal "duty of candour" for public officials and bodies during investigations into major disasters. This legislation, championed for years by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, aims to end a culture of cover-ups and institutional defensiveness. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law will ensure that those affected by state-related disasters receive legal funding and that officials who fail to cooperate honestly could face criminal sanctions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a cooling job market and economic uncertainty, American workers are increasingly "hugging" their current jobs, with the rate of voluntary departures falling to its lowest sustained level since 2016. This trend is driven by a slower pace of hiring and fears of potential layoffs, making employees hesitant to risk being the newest hire at a different company. Career experts advise that while staying put can feel safer, it's crucial for workers to avoid complacency. They recommend seeking internal growth opportunities and building professional networks to remain valuable and prepared for when the job market eventually improves.</p>

          <p>Luckin Coffee, the chain that surpassed Starbucks as the largest in China, has launched its first locations in New York City, marking a significant entry into the U.S. market. The company operates a cashierless model, with all orders placed through a mobile app that heavily features discounts and coupons. While its initial U.S. stores are reportedly operating at a loss to build brand awareness, the move signals a bold challenge to Starbucks. Luckin's expansion comes after a dramatic history that includes a 2020 accounting fraud scandal, delisting from the Nasdaq, and a subsequent corporate restructuring.</p>

The forum highlights the growing strategic competition with the United States, evidenced by the differing levels of diplomatic representation each country sends to the other's preferred security conference.
