          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant breakthrough, stating that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal following negotiations in Egypt. This agreement is expected to lead to the swift release of all hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed line, marking a crucial step towards lasting peace. The Israel Defense Forces are preparing for the hostage return operation, while Hamas has already submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners for exchange. This development brings a glimmer of hope for de-escalation in the war-torn Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement for the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, marking the "first Phase" of a peace deal. The agreement, confirmed by Qatari officials, Hamas, and Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu, is expected to see hostages released as early as Monday, including the bodies of those deceased. This development follows intense negotiations and outlines a path for aid entry and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. Trump praised the deal as a "GREAT Day" for all involved parties, hinting at further steps in his broader peace plan.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a Gaza peace deal, Republican lawmakers lauded him as a "peace president," with some even suggesting a Nobel Peace Prize. Senators like Joni Ernst and Bernie Moreno praised the agreement for potentially ending the hostage crisis and bringing peace to the Middle East. However, Palestinian Americans, including poet Mosab Abu Toha and scholar Yousef Munayyer, expressed deep skepticism, highlighting the lack of clarity on a permanent ceasefire, the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the potential for continued conflict despite the initial agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, now in its first phase, outlines an immediate ceasefire, phased Israeli troop withdrawal, and a hostage-for-prisoner exchange. The plan calls for Gaza's demilitarization under international monitors, with governance shifting to a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" and an "International Stabilization Force." It also addresses humanitarian aid, economic redevelopment, and hints at a pathway to Palestinian statehood, though Netanyahu has opposed this. Hamas agreed to key portions, but significant questions remain regarding implementation and the roles of various international partners.</p>

          <p>At the Supreme Court, justices from across the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism regarding a case challenging Illinois' voting regulations, specifically a rule allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election.

Justices questioned the standing of a winning candidate to sue and the lack of specific facts in Bost's brief.
