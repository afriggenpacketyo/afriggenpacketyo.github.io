          <p>Amazon's Zoox robotaxi unit issued a software recall for 270 of its robotaxis following a crash in Las Vegas last month. The recall addresses a defect in the automated driving system that could cause inaccurate predictions of other cars' movements, increasing the risk of a collision. The company paused driverless operations, investigated the incident, and implemented a software update across all Zoox vehicles to resume operations safely. The incident involved an unoccupied robotaxi colliding with a passenger vehicle, but no injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>House GOP leaders are working to reassure their conference that President Trump's budget package remains on track, despite delays and disagreements within the Republican ranks. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged a "pause" to ensure the bill is done correctly, but expressed confidence that the House would complete its work by Memorial Day. Disagreements persist over issues such as the state and local tax deduction and Medicaid cuts, with committees facing a May 9 deadline to finalize their work. Democrats have introduced a discharge petition to prevent cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, adding further pressure to the reconciliation process.</p>

          <p>A declassified U.S. intelligence memo contradicts claims made by President Trump that the Venezuelan government, led by Nicolas Maduro, controls the Tren de Aragua (TDA) criminal gang operating in the U.S. The memo, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, states that while some Maduro regime members may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation. The memo also suggests that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling, further undermining the Trump administration's justification for deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

The strategy involves identifying viable candidates who can potentially pull off upsets in conservative areas, requiring Democrats to think outside the box and stretch their resources across a difficult electoral landscape, according to the New York Times article.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above target, some areas of the U.S. economy are experiencing price declines, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. However, economist Mark Zandi cautions that these lower prices are not sustainable due to factors like volatile markets and potential tariffs. The recent surge in imports reflects efforts by companies across the country to bring in foreign goods before more duties kicked in. While the price drops may offer some temporary relief for consumers, they are unlikely to persist in the long term.</p>
