        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated he would consider pardoning Diddy, while also asserting that China has violated its trade agreement with the U.S., leading to stalled talks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the trade discussions have hit a standstill. Concurrently, Trump's tariff policies faced legal challenges as federal courts ruled against his unilateral imposition of certain levies, though these tariffs remain in place pending appeal. Elon Musk is stepping down from his role as a "special government employee" but will continue to advise Trump unofficially, offering insights from his private sector expertise. Optimism around the U.S. economy remains cautiously optimistic given these developments. </p>

          <p>President Trump is asserting his authority over tariff policies, dismissing the need for congressional approval despite legal challenges to his measures. After a U.S. trade court briefly halted his tariffs, Trump criticized the idea of requiring congressional approval, claiming it would undermine presidential power. While Republican leaders have largely deferred to Trump on other issues, his tariff policies have faced resistance, leading him to act independently. The legal battle may reach the Supreme Court, testing the "major questions doctrine" regarding presidential authority, as Democrats accuse Trump of acting like a monarch.</p>

          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging designs to mislead customers into buying store-brand products. The lawsuit claims Aldi's packaging closely resembles Mondelez's in font, colors, and image placement, creating confusion among consumers. Mondelez is seeking monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products. Aldi has faced similar lawsuits before, including one earlier this year in the U.K. regarding cider packaging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is known for his pessimistic outlook on the economy, even as his bank achieves record profits. Despite his warnings of economic hurricanes and geopolitical turmoil, JPMorgan's performance has consistently surpassed rivals, leading to increased investor confidence. Some analysts suggest Dimon's cautious pronouncements may be a strategy to keep his management team focused on potential risks and prevent complacency, while others believe it's wiser for bankers to broadcast caution rather than optimism. Dimon's track record of economic predictions is not as strong as his leadership of the bank, yet his vigilance has helped JPMorgan navigate challenging times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring gold prices in June, as the market experiences fluctuations amid economic uncertainty. The price of gold has recently dipped from a record high but remains significantly elevated, driven by its appeal as a safe-haven asset during inflationary periods. With upcoming inflation readings and Federal Reserve meetings, experts anticipate potential price spikes, encouraging investors to consider cost-effective strategies like fractional gold or dollar-cost averaging. While gold prices typically rise over time, investors should evaluate the market carefully and limit gold to a small portion of their overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, amidst investor and union member uncertainty regarding the proposed merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Trump previously described the deal as a "partnership," claiming U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and Nippon would invest $14 billion. However, details about the deal's structure remain scarce, especially after President Biden initially blocked the acquisition on national security grounds. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick suggested the U.S. government would have a "golden share" to ensure U.S. control and production levels, but the specifics of this arrangement are still unclear.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, alongside President Trump, stated that he expects the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to achieve $1 trillion in cuts "over time". Trump praised Musk's work as "without comparison in modern history," emphasizing the sweeping reforms implemented by DOGE. Musk, who is concluding his tenure as a "special government employee," reiterated his commitment to reducing wasteful spending and expressed confidence in DOGE's future. While the White House claims DOGE has saved approximately $170 billion, critics argue the initiative could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity, and this assessment is controversial.</p>

Alex Rikleen is challenging Markey, 78, criticizing his lack of pushback against President Trump. These challenges come as Democrats grapple with internal divisions and seek to energize their base following recent election setbacks, with some advocating for more aggressive opposition to the Trump administration.
