          <p>A U.S. District Judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's effort to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. The decision sides with migrant advocacy groups, stating the administration's process was unprecedented and violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to consult appropriate agencies. While the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and will likely appeal, the judgment currently blocks the termination of legal protections and work permits for these individuals.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots rookie left tackle Will Campbell has doubled down on his bold draft-day statement that he would be willing to die for quarterback Drake Maye. In a recent interview, the former LSU star reaffirmed his emotional declaration, calling Maye "my guy" and standing by his words. Campbell, the No. 4 overall pick, is seen as a crucial protector for Maye's blindside for years to come. However, his participation in the upcoming season opener against the Las Vegas Raiders is uncertain as he is listed as questionable due to an ankle injury.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after his appointment, questions remain about the tactical direction of the England men's national football team under manager Thomas Tuchel. Having coached only four games, Tuchel has had limited time to establish a clear identity, a stark contrast to his predecessors who managed more matches in a similar timeframe. The article analyzes his squad selections, which favor Premier League talent, and tactical shifts towards a more physically imposing, ball-dominant style using flexible 4-4-1-1, 2-3-5, and 3-2-5 formations. While some performance metrics show improvement, the overall effectiveness of his approach is still under evaluation.</p>

          <p>During Thursday's game, New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone successfully requested that umpires inspect a bat used by Houston Astros outfielder Taylor Trammell due to its "discoloration." Following a review, the bat was confiscated and sent to the league office for further inspection to determine if it violated MLB rules against colored bats. Trammell, who expressed confusion and defended his character after the game, was allowed to remain on base. Astros manager Joe Espada suggested the bat was simply worn down, while Boone stated the team had noticed it earlier in the series.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has agreed to a landmark settlement of at least $1.5 billion to resolve a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged the company illegally used their books to train its AI models. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will pay approximately $3,000 per book and has committed to destroying the datasets containing the pirated material. The case has been closely watched as a key test for copyright law in the age of generative AI. If approved, this would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, Giorgio Armani is being remembered not just as a legendary fashion designer but also as a brilliant businessman who built a global empire. He revolutionized office attire with his softly tailored power suits for both men and women in the 1970s and 80s, tapping into the cultural zeitgeist. A key to his success was maintaining full ownership and creative control of his brand, allowing for consistent vision across a diverse portfolio that expanded into perfumes, home furnishings, and more. Armani was also a pioneer in using Hollywood celebrity endorsements to elevate his brand's global prestige.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of government data reveals significant state-by-state disparities in lottery spending, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. Rhode Island follows at $573, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50 annually. The report suggests that accessibility may play a role, as urban areas offer more opportunities to purchase tickets. Lottery sales represent a notable source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general funds and rising as high as 3% in states like Rhode Island.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis examines the crime data for Chicago in response to President Trump's claims that the city is a "hell hole" and "murder capital." According to FBI data, Chicago's violent crime rate in 2024 was down 11% from 2023 and ranked 29th out of 37 large U.S. cities, lower than New York and Los Angeles. While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides last year, its homicide rate per 100,000 people was tenth highest. Analysts caution against using such data for direct city-to-city rankings due to differences in reporting and city boundaries.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written response to a dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett explained that she felt Jackson's "spirited argument" merited an equally "spirited response," clarifying that the exchange was about legal ideas, not a personal conflict. She emphasized her "great respect" for Justice Jackson and quoted the late Justice Antonin Scalia, stating, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people." Barrett stressed that the justices can debate vigorously on the page while maintaining friendly and collegial relationships off the bench.</p>

          <p>A favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case sparked a major rally for Alphabet and other tech giants, adding a combined $420 billion in market capitalization to the top eight U.S. tech companies this week. A judge declined to force Google to sell its Chrome browser, imposing more limited remedies and noting the competitive landscape has been altered by generative AI. The decision also benefited Apple, as it preserves the lucrative deal making Google the default search engine on iPhones. This surge has pushed the market value of these eight companies to $21 trillion, representing a historic 36% of the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign that has greeted travelers at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years is being temporarily dismantled. The removal is necessary to accommodate a major reconfiguration of the surrounding roadways designed to improve traffic flow and access ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. The project aims to create elevated roadways that separate airport traffic from local traffic, reducing congestion on Sepulveda Boulevard. The iconic letters will be stored and reinstalled in a new location once the construction project is complete.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest level since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop was the largest one-day decline in over a year, providing some relief to potential homebuyers facing high prices. For a median-priced home, this rate change could save a borrower nearly $170 per month on their mortgage payment. However, it remains uncertain whether this drop will be substantial enough to reinvigorate housing demand, which has been sluggish due to broader affordability challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
