          <p>Shares of Kering, the French fashion house owning Gucci and Saint Laurent, jumped 9% following reports of Luca de Meo's potential appointment as CEO. De Meo, currently Renault's CEO, is credited with the carmaker's turnaround. Kering has struggled with its Gucci brand, leading to a search for new leadership to rejuvenate its brands and improve financial performance. Analysts believe de Meo's brand management and marketing skills could benefit Kering, though challenges remain in the luxury sector, including consumer preference for top brands and the need for significant investment.

          <p>The documentary "Sabbath Queen" follows Amichai Lau-Lavie, an openly queer rabbi from a long Orthodox lineage, exploring his identity and calls for peace. Lau-Lavie, a social activist and community leader, uses his experiences to challenge homophobia, racism, and misogyny within Judaism. The film highlights his journey from a drag queen persona, Rebbetzin Hadassah Gross, to becoming a Conservative rabbi, pushing boundaries with interfaith weddings and queer interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. Despite facing criticism, Lau-Lavie advocates for compassion towards all, emphasizing the need for morality and love in Jewish tradition, especially amidst increasing polarization.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Cyprus to discuss the potential role of the country in the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) trade link. The IMEC project, seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative, aims to connect India to Europe via sea and railway. Modi's visit also carries significance in India, as it is interpreted as a message to Turkey, given its support for Pakistan in recent hostilities with India. Discussions also include strengthening cooperation through a memorandum of understanding between the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the Eurobank of Cyprus to introduce UPI services for cross-border transactions.</p>

French President Emmanuel Macron has advocated for stronger ties between Europe and the Indo-Pacific region, citing shared challenges such as the erosion of alliances and threats to sovereignty. While Southeast Asia offers Europe access to new markets and diversified supply chains, experts doubt Europe can surpass the established influence of the U.S. or China in the region, particularly without significant increases in trade and investment.</p>
