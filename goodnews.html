        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing, with a cash value of approximately $589 million, after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Monday's $1.2 billion prize. This makes the current grand prize the fifth-largest in Powerball's history and potentially the fourth-largest by the time of the drawing, as sales continue to increase. The upcoming drawing marks the 41st since the last jackpot was won in California on May 31, 2025. A single winner could choose between a lump-sum payment of an estimated $589 million before taxes or an annuity for approximately $1.30 billion that would be received in one immediate payment followed by 29 annual ones that increase by 5-percent each year, all also before taxes. The odds of winning a Powerball jackpot are 1-in-292.2 million.</p>

          <p>The annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin concluded with strong signals of closer member relationships, as Beijing actively promotes a new global security and economic order challenging U.S. dominance. Chinese President Xi Jinping criticized "Cold War mentality and bullying," a veiled reference to U.S. trade policies. Key outcomes included a thawing of India-China relations, with leaders pledging cooperation despite border disputes and U.S. tariff pressures, and a notable display of unity between Xi, Modi, and Putin. The summit also advanced an AI partnership roadmap and proposed a new SCO development bank to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, signaling a strategic shift in global governance.

          <p>Chinese shipping companies are strategically collaborating with global partners to reduce their exposure to the U.S. market and explore regional opportunities, anticipating the introduction of new, steep U.S. port fees in October. Cosco Shipping Holdings, a major Chinese conglomerate, indicated a focus on expanding into emerging and regional markets, with significant growth in Chinese mainland, intra-Asia, and other international services during the first half of the year. Orient Overseas International Ltd (OOIL), a Cosco subsidiary, explicitly acknowledged the risks posed by the U.S. port fees while also identifying potential new opportunities. This proactive approach aims to navigate the evolving global trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While pickleball continues its surge in the U.S., the sport is rapidly gaining traction in China, with online sales of equipment skyrocketing over six-fold this year to an average of $1.2 million monthly. This growth reflects a broader shift towards active lifestyles and is fueled by social media influencers and a resurgence of tennis interest. Industry experts note that China's unique urban landscape is fostering a business-driven approach to court development, with many entrepreneurs seeing significant profit potential. Despite challenges like language barriers for foreign brands, the sport's accessibility and structured development through the Chinese Tennis Association suggest a promising future, contributing to a pickup in consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Utah is grappling with a severe shortage of affordable starter homes, a challenge exacerbated by rising prices and growing demand, pushing the median age of first-time U.S. homebuyers to a record 38. Governor Spencer Cox launched an ambitious initiative to build 35,000 lower-cost homes in five years, offering low-interest construction loans for developers. However, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. Experts suggest bolder changes to zoning laws are needed, which lawmakers have resisted. Despite the hurdles, some developers, like Jed Nilson, are finding ways to build attractive starter homes for under $400,000, offering a glimmer of hope for young families.

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner, the defending US Open champion, swiftly advanced to the quarter-finals by thrashing Alexander Bublik 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 in a match lasting just 81 minutes. Following his defeat, Bublik humorously labeled Sinner an "AI" player due to his ruthless and flawless performance, a description he had used prior to the match. Sinner, who has already secured Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year, extended his hard-court Grand Slam winning streak to 25 matches. Despite Bublik's attempts at unconventional serves, Sinner's powerful groundstrokes and athleticism proved overwhelming, setting up an all-Italian quarter-final against Lorenzo Musetti.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing a "necessity for generational change in the party." Nadler, 78, made the decision after observing former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election. First elected in 1992, he chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as a manager for former President Trump's first impeachment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a "relentless fighter for justice, civil rights and liberties." Nadler's retirement opens the door for new leadership, including a primary challenger who emphasized the need for the party to be more "generationally relevant."</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre has developed a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed for astronauts, aiming to solve the challenge of doing laundry in space. This cube-shaped device, slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase and weighing 12kg, uses only 400ml of water per cycle. Instead of traditional detergent, it employs ultrasonic atomization to deliver an ultra-fine mist and utilizes ultraviolet light to produce ozone, which disinfects clothes for up to five wears. This innovative technology addresses a critical need for long-duration space missions, conserving precious water resources and improving astronaut well-being.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Hints at Advanced Hypersonic Missile Variants in Upcoming Parade</h2>

          <p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has suggested that an upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing will showcase improved variants of its hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17, featuring enhanced penetration capabilities. Military commentator Wei Dongxu indicated the potential appearance of an air-launched YJ-21 variant, known as the KD-21, which could be deployed from bombers outside enemy air defense zones to strike targets before safely returning. Wei described the development as pointing to a "family of land-, sea- and air-launched variants," emphasizing their versatility across combat scenarios. While satellite imagery has hinted at ongoing development since 2018, China has not yet officially confirmed these missiles are in service.</p>
