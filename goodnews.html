          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa is reportedly exploring a potential deal to sign Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho. The 25-year-old English player has been out of favor at United, having last played for the club in August 2024. Sancho has previously spent loan spells at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, with neither club opting for a permanent transfer. The potential move for Sancho is reportedly separate from Manchester United's interest in Aston Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez.</p>

While overall revenue missed analyst expectations, a 78% surge in net income and strategic investments in "instant commerce" have bolstered investor confidence in the Chinese tech giant's future prospects.

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk experienced a 3% increase in its share price after releasing trial data for its weight-loss drug, Wegovy. The study indicated that Wegovy provides a significantly greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to rival drugs from Eli Lilly. Specifically, users of Wegovy's active ingredient, semaglutide, showed up to a 57% greater risk reduction than those using tirzepatide. This development reinforces Novo Nordisk's strong position in the highly competitive market for weight management medications. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" that will provide financial relief to families. However, the rollout faces significant challenges, as many parents are encountering long waiting lists for nursery places. Nurseries report that staff shortages and insufficient government funding rates are limiting their capacity to meet the soaring demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail has permanently abolished peak-time fares on its train services, meaning passengers will no longer face higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. This policy, championed by the Scottish Greens, aims to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, offering significant savings on key routes. For example, a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will now be nearly 50% cheaper. The move follows a pilot scheme and is intended to make rail travel more affordable, flexible, and straightforward for passengers across Scotland.</p>

          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered a population of brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source in the Taklamakan Desert. Also known as Artemia, these shrimp are valued as aquaculture feed and for their use in medicine and cosmetics. The discovery in the city of Aral suggests the region has natural conditions suitable for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. Further research will determine if this is a new species and explore its potential for commercial aquaculture development in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>A joint operation between Greek and German police has successfully dismantled a large-scale criminal organization smuggling cocaine from Spain to Greece and other European countries. Five suspected members of the ring were arrested last week, with more arrests expected, and over 300 kg of cocaine were confiscated. The gang, which had generated an estimated profit of over 5 million euros, concealed the drugs in trucks transporting goods internationally. The investigation was initiated based on a tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).</p>

          <p>The American Volunteer Group, known as the "Flying Tigers," a group of American mercenaries who aided China during World War II, continues to be revered in the country despite current geopolitical tensions. In 1941, these pilots and support staff were hired to defend China against Japanese aerial attacks, achieving remarkable success with their shark-mouthed P-40 fighter planes. Their contribution is so valued that relatives of the group's founder were among the few American guests invited to a recent military parade in Beijing commemorating the war's end. The story highlights a unique chapter of U.S.-China cooperation.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing sector showed unexpected growth in August, with the private RatingDog purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5, its fastest expansion in five months. This result, which beat economist predictions of a contraction, was driven by a recovery in new orders and export business, suggesting some resilience in external demand. However, the positive private survey contrasts with official government data that showed manufacturing activity shrinking for the fifth consecutive month. Analysts caution that the recovery is patchy, with domestic demand remaining weak and employment in the sector continuing to decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was sought by immigrant advocacy groups who argued the children would face abuse and persecution upon their return. The administration contended the flights were for "repatriation" to reunite children with their families, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers. The judge's order, which will be in place for 14 days, covers all unaccompanied children at risk of deportation and was issued amid concerns that some planes had already departed.</p>

          <p>A meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin signals a potential reset in relations, largely influenced by recent U.S. trade policies. The Trump administration's tariffs on Indian imports have pushed New Delhi to seek stronger ties with its neighbor, despite long-standing border disputes and a significant trade deficit with China. While the leaders promised to work through their differences, major roadblocks remain, including military deployments at their contested border. This diplomatic shift presents a challenge for India's "strategic autonomy" as it navigates its relationships with both the U.S.-led Quad and China.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has reacted to the shocking trade of his former teammate, All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons, to the Green Bay Packers. Prescott admitted he didn't expect the trade but said he "wasn't surprised" given the seemingly personal nature of the contract negotiations between Parsons and the team's management. The trade, which fulfilled Parsons' request, sent him to Green Bay in exchange for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Parsons subsequently signed a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.</p>
