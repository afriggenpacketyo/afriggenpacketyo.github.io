          <p>A Johnson & Johnson clinical trial has shown promising results in treating multiple myeloma, a cancer considered incurable, with a third of patients living without detectable cancer for years after facing certain death. This development offers new hope for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. The trial's success highlights the potential of immunotherapy in treating previously untreatable conditions. Further research and broader application of these treatments could significantly improve outcomes for those affected by multiple myeloma.</p>

          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for weeks, with evacuations lifted on Memorial Day. Firefighters have made significant progress, but Canadian wildfire smoke continues to affect Minnesota's air quality, prompting alerts.

Donations are being accepted to support relief for affected community members in Lake and St. Louis Counties.

          <p>Conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo has conceded defeat in South Korea's presidential election, congratulating his liberal rival Lee Jae-myung on his victory. Preliminary vote tallies and exit polls had indicated a comfortable win for Lee, who led with over 48% of the votes.

Lee has pledged to work towards unity and address the expectations of the people. The National Election Commission will validate the result before Lee takes office.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife with a different set of challenges and expectations compared to previous generations, as they often lack the financial stability and traditional milestones. This generation, which entered the workforce during economic downturns, faces a midlife crisis characterized by a search for opportunity and personal fulfillment rather than a desire to abandon established lives. External factors like the economy and political climate also play a role in shaping their experiences. Experts suggest that millennials are better equipped to handle this transition by reframing it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.</p>

          <p>In this installment of "Dear James," a reader questions how to reconcile their punk rock sensibilities with the indignities of middle age, such as sensible shoes and insurance conversations. James Parker responds by asserting that the reader is indeed punk rock, encouraging them to use their world-weary vision as a stimulant rather than an end point. He suggests refining language and finding small joys amidst the absurdities of life. Parker also recommends the band Godflesh for those seeking music that embodies both beauty and horror.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is beginning to rehire more than 100 employees to stabilize operations at field offices nationwide following cuts ordered by the Trump administration earlier this year. The new hires will fill critical positions such as meteorologists, hydrologists, physical scientists, and electronic technicians, addressing staff shortages that had impacted service capabilities. Some field offices were no longer staffed around the clock, and weather balloon launches had been reduced, affecting data gathering for forecasts. The NWS was granted an exemption to a government-wide hiring freeze to fill these permanent, mission-critical roles.</p>
