          <p>Around 200 Marines were deployed to Los Angeles to guard the Wilshire Federal Building, a rare instance of military deployment on U.S. soil.  This followed protests related to immigration enforcement operations, with the deployment described as "authoritarian" by California's governor.  Despite a legal challenge, the Marines' presence is permitted until a court hearing on June 17.  A Marine temporarily detained a U.S. Army veteran, mistaking him for a protester, before releasing him.</p>
