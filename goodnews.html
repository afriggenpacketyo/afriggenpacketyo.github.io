          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a new stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving forward with plans to build a new venue at the RFK Stadium site. This development comes despite recent threats from President Trump to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name. Council chairman Phil Mendelson characterized the president's comments as an unhelpful distraction and expressed confidence that the council will approve the proposal. The deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, is seen as a crucial step for creating jobs and driving investment in the Ward 7 area.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at U.S. Postal Service facilities cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is not returned to sender but is instead sent digitally to a unique center in Salt Lake City, Utah. This Remote Encoding Center (REC) employs hundreds of 'data conversion operators' who work around the clock to manually decipher these difficult addresses. These specialists, known as keyers, process approximately 900 images of mail per hour, ensuring that millions of otherwise undeliverable letters reach their intended destinations. If a keyer cannot decode an address, it is sent for a final hands-on inspection as a last resort.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Signs Executive Order to Regulate College Athlete Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:24:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order aimed at regulating the evolving landscape of college sports, particularly name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue-sharing. The order seeks to rein in what the White House calls an "out-of-control, rudderless system" by banning third-party, pay-for-play payments while still permitting brand endorsements. It also mandates that revenue-sharing agreements must preserve or expand scholarships for women's and non-revenue sports. The order directs the National Labor Relations Board to clarify the employment status of collegiate athletes, a move likely aimed at curbing unionization efforts among players.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread fear caused by ongoing immigration enforcement raids, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to affected parishioners. The Family Assistance Program aims to support vulnerable members of its 4 million congregants who are afraid to leave their homes for fear of arrest and deportation. Archbishop José Gomez stated that these are hard-working individuals making important contributions who now live in fear. The initiative is funded by donations, with businessman Rick Caruso contributing $50,000 and offering to match another $50,000 in donations.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress and pop star Renée Rapp addressed her reputation for being unfiltered and making candid, off-script comments during media appearances. The "Mean Girls" star explained that while she initially felt insecure about her personality being analyzed, she has embraced it, finding traditional media training boring and inauthentic. Rapp also discussed the immense pressure and depression she faced last year while being pushed to quickly produce a new album after a hit single. Her new music, including the single "Leave Me Alone," reflects these frustrations and her personal experiences with relationships and career burnout.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the merger of Paramount Global with Skydance Media, removing the final regulatory obstacle for the major transaction.

Skydance also affirmed that the newly formed company will not have diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The approval allows the deal, which unites major brands like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and Nickelodeon under new ownership, to proceed toward its closing.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Argues Big Tech Is Underspending on Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 19:08:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending but are actually underspending on artificial intelligence. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and to spend less implies a lack of belief in one's ability to win. This commentary comes as these companies plan to spend a combined $320 billion on AI and data centers in 2025, a significant increase from 2024. Cramer points to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification for aggressive investment, suggesting the most accurate chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly.

          <h2>Tech Companies Develop Natural Alternatives as Artificial Food Dyes Are Phased Out</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 19:01:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As regulators like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) move to ban or phase out artificial food colorings such as Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are innovating to create natural alternatives. Companies like French firm Fermentalg are using microalgae to produce stable, vibrant pigments like Galdieria blue, which was recently approved for use in food. The shift away from synthetic, petroleum-based dyes is driven by health concerns and consumer pressure. While natural colors can be more expensive to produce, the challenge for food brands is to match the vividness and shelf-life of their artificial counterparts to maintain consumer appeal.</p>

          <p>The post-credits scene in Marvel's new film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," provides a significant tease for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The mid-credits scene reveals the iconic villain Doctor Doom, who will be played by Robert Downey Jr., interacting with the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, Franklin Richards. This encounter directly sets up the next major crossover film, retitled "Avengers: Doomsday," and hints at the reason the Fantastic Four will eventually cross over from their alternate universe (Earth-828) into the main MCU timeline. The scene confirms Doom as the next major antagonist, a pivot from the studio's original plans involving Kang the Conqueror.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, now in his third year, is on track for a significant contract extension in the upcoming offseason. After two stellar seasons, including a record-breaking rookie year, Nacua has established himself as a top NFL receiver, making his current salary of just over $1 million one of the league's best bargains. Recent lucrative extensions for other young receivers, like Garrett Wilson's $90 million guaranteed deal, have set a high benchmark for the market. As the Rams' new number one receiver alongside Davante Adams, another strong season could position Nacua for a massive payday in 2026.</p>
