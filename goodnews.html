          <p>Canada Goose's shares jumped 20% after exceeding fiscal fourth-quarter earnings expectations, although the company withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainties.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 33 Canadian cents, surpassing the expected 23 Canadian cents. The luxury retailer noted that the majority of its products are not directly impacted by tariffs, though the indirect effects on the global economy create uncertainty. </p>

          <p>A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, highlighting the advantages of telework. The report suggests that telework offers benefits like reduced turnover, cost savings, and increased productivity when leaders embrace strategic culture-building and performance tracking. Companies that ignore these findings risk talent attrition and reduced agility. The GAO study reveals that offering remote days can significantly reduce turnover and that employees value autonomy and work-life balance. </p>

          <p>Callable CDs can be worth considering if you want to earn more interest, but there are some risks to consider, too. Callable CDs offer higher interest rates than traditional CDs but allow the bank to redeem them before the full term. Experts suggest considering callable CDs if you can secure a notably higher rate or find a CD with a long call protection period. Savings accounts, particularly high-yield ones, are another smart way to grow your savings. (not investment advice) </p>
