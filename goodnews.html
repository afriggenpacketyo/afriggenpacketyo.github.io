          <p>International health experts are refuting the Trump administration's announcement that links acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, to an increased risk of autism when used during pregnancy. The European Medicines Agency, the UK's regulatory agency, and Australian health officials all released statements confirming there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support this causal link, and they continue to recommend the medication as a safe option for pain and fever. Spain's Minister of Health and a World Health Organization spokesperson also criticized the claim for lacking evidence. These positions are supported by large-scale studies, including one in Sweden that followed 2.5 million children.</p>

          <p>Actress Scarlett Johansson is making her directorial debut with the new film "Eleanor the Great," starring 95-year-old June Squibb. The movie follows Eleanor Morgenstein, a 94-year-old woman who moves to New York City after her best friend's death and inadvertently finds herself entangled in a lie within a Holocaust survivors support group. Squibb praised Johansson's directing, noting her leadership and actor-centric approach made the experience wonderful. Johansson stated that directing has been a dream since she was 12 and that this project came at the right time in her career, allowing her to explore a new creative role.</p>

          <p>Napoleon Jinnies, who became the first male cheerleader in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams in 2018, is defending the Minnesota Vikings' male cheerleaders, Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn, against recent social media outcry. Jinnies dismissed the criticism as unoriginal, recalling similar negative reactions he faced during his own career. He emphasized that the detractors are not critiquing the performers' skills or artistry, but are instead repeating old prejudices. Jinnies praised Shiek and Conn for their talent, stating they are "beat-for-beat, step-for-step killing it with the girls" and shining as performers despite the backlash.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may be the most viable figure to lead the Democratic party out of the current political landscape dominated by an aging establishment and the influence of Trumpism. The piece notes growing frustration with the status quo and a recent poll showing Democratic voters prefer socialist-aligned politicians like AOC over establishment figures. While acknowledging that Ocasio-Cortez has moderated some of her initial left-wing stances, the author argues her charisma and fighting spirit are essential for the future. The article concludes that despite her flaws, AOC's potential should not be underestimated in a potential 2028 presidential or Senate run.</p>

While on a walk, a sudden fireworks display caused the dog to panic on slippery sidewalks, making it impossible for her to get him home safely. A stranger named Blake noticed her distress, first offering to help walk the dog and then, when that failed, driving both Friedman and The Dude home. Friedman expressed immense gratitude for the kindness shown by Blake and his friend, highlighting how their selfless act rescued her from a dangerous and overwhelming moment.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is not just a barometer for the U.S. stock market; it is also a major source of revenue for its parent company, S&P Global. The company profits by licensing the S&P 500 name and data to financial firms that create products like index funds and ETFs, which now hold trillions in assets. This business model is protected by a strong competitive "moat," built on a trusted brand name, economies of scale, and its status as a common language in finance. Despite criticism that the index is now heavily dominated by a few tech giants, it continues to accurately reflect the market's state, making it a cornerstone of modern investing.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, its most affordable level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128. This is about $210 less per month compared to the payments at the start of 2025, when rates were above 7%, translating to over $75,000 in interest savings over the life of the loan. The lower rates have also created attractive refinancing opportunities for current homeowners, potentially making homeownership more accessible and affordable for many. (not investment advice)</p>

Emil's journey attracted thousands of online fans who followed his movements through videos and posts.

          <p>Despite Germany's consistent success in international and club football, a German player has not won the Ballon d'Or since Matthias Sammer in 1996. One primary reason is the award's overwhelming preference for attacking players, a category where Germany has lacked the world-class talent it produced in previous eras. Furthermore, the nearly two-decade dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo created an insurmountable hurdle for all other contenders. With their era now fading, there is new hope for young German talents like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz to potentially end the country's long drought for football's most prestigious individual prize.</p>
