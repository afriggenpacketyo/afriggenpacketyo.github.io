          <h2>Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump's Ban on Foreign Harvard Students</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. This order responds to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech, while Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security and to combat antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber indicated the university is creating contingency plans for international students if they cannot travel to campus.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate the Benefits of Eating Food Products With Fewer Ingredients</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more retailers and food brands offer items with fewer ingredients, prompted by concerns around ultra-processed foods, nutritionists and food scientists are debating the health benefits of this trend. Some experts, like Dr. Laura Wyness, argue that leaving out fortified nutrients in pursuit of shorter ingredient lists can be detrimental to public health. Others, such as Dr. Jibin He, suggest that simplifying formulas and using novel processing technologies can create less processed products without sacrificing nutritional value. The debate highlights the complexity of defining healthy food and the need for consumers to be well-informed about their choices.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space to assess their durability during space travel, signaling a move toward building an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket to test their robustness against vibration and radiation. The test is a crucial step in transitioning from experimental validation to constructing a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is seen as a highly secure communication method that skips the encryption key-sharing step.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning social media users about a fake online advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewal services. The deceptive ad asks for personal information and payment through Cash App, which the DMV will never request. The DMV advises residents to renew their vehicle registration through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office to avoid the scam.</p>

          <h2>Churchill's Penicillin Push Before D-Day Revealed in Notes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Handwritten notes have revealed Winston Churchill's intense efforts to secure penicillin supplies in time for D-Day, highlighting his frustration with slow progress despite it being a British discovery. Official papers show Churchill's concern over Britain's inability to produce the "wonder drug" at scale, relying heavily on the United States for supplies. Although sufficient penicillin was obtained for battle casualties shortly before D-Day, it was not fully available to the general public until 1946. The documents underscore the critical importance of penicillin in treating wounds and preventing blood poisoning during the war.</p>

          <p>Beyonc√©'s Cowboy Carter tour has commenced with a nearly sold-out stadium in London, showcasing her country era through a spectacular three-hour performance. The show, featuring elaborate costumes and a setlist heavily focused on her 2024 album, received critical acclaim, yet concerns about slow ticket sales and high prices have overshadowed the tour. Despite promoters slashing ticket prices to fill the stadium, some fans who purchased tickets earlier felt short-changed. The performance included nods to black performers segregated from the country scene, blending Beyonc√©'s biggest hits with Cowboy Carter tracks.</p>
