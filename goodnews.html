          <p>A recent study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry indicates that lifestyle choices can significantly lower the risk of dementia, stroke, and late-life depression. The study, led by Dr. Sanjula Singh, highlights that modifiable risk factors account for a substantial percentage of these conditions, specifically 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia, and 35% of late-life depression. Experts recommend focusing on key practices to stave off these brain conditions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of stroke, depression, and dementia, where one condition can increase the likelihood of developing the others. Prioritizing brain health through lifestyle adjustments can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling later life.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett criticized protectionist trade policies at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, cautioning against using trade as a weapon. He emphasized that global prosperity benefits the United States and advocated for countries to specialize in their strengths to foster mutual growth. Buffett highlighted the potential long-term negative consequences of tariffs and protectionism, especially considering the United States' position as a leading industrial nation. Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter earnings report noted "considerable uncertainty" due to tariffs and geopolitical events, and Buffett has been defensively selling stocks, increasing Berkshire's cash reserves to a record $347 billion.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the six most common anxieties in children that parents often underestimate: social dynamics, social media, life changes, over-scheduling, inconsistency, and trauma. Children are increasingly worried about fitting in, social media comparisons, and changes in their routines or family structures. Trauma, even from seemingly small incidents, can significantly impact a child's sense of safety. The therapists recommend teaching children coping strategies like naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, using affirming phrases, and scheduling a 'worry window' to manage their anxieties effectively.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive term as Australian Prime Minister, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian leader has achieved this milestone. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging the Labor Party's historic win. Albanese emphasized his government's improved relations with China and criticized the opposition's adoption of "American-style politics" focused on division. The election took place against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with both parties promising policies to assist first-home buyers and address the country's changing demographics.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to return to the airwaves after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked an executive order by President Trump that sought to dismantle the broadcaster. The court's decision allows VoA to resume broadcasting while the legal challenge proceeds, restoring access to government email accounts and enabling a phased return to the office for staff. However, the ruling is less favorable for other publicly funded broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as the freeze on their congressionally approved funds remains in effect, leading to staffing cuts and content reductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage hailed Reform UK's recent election results as "unprecedented," asserting that they signal the end of two-party politics in Britain. The party has gained control of several local councils and mayoral races, largely at the expense of the Labour and Conservative parties. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged that people are not yet feeling the benefits of a Labour government, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch pledged to make her party a "credible" alternative. The results reflect a broader dissatisfaction with the established political order and a shift in voter preferences.</p>

          <p>Several German states are considering implementing smartphone bans in schools to address concerns about student distraction and cyberbullying. One high school in North Rhine-Westphalia is already piloting a smartphone ban, requiring students to keep their phones turned off in their bags throughout the school day. Teachers report that students are more relaxed and less distracted during lessons, and there are indications that cyberbullying incidents have decreased. While some student representatives and unions are skeptical, arguing that students should learn to use their smartphones responsibly, education researchers advocate for a total ban in primary schools and strict rules in older grades.</p>

          <p>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) are collaborating to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis's impact, following the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The societies aim to sustain the momentum of the NCA by creating a mechanism for important work on climate change to continue, covering observations, projections, impacts, risks, and solutions. This collaboration is seen as a critical pathway for researchers to come together and provide the science needed to support global efforts to address climate change.
