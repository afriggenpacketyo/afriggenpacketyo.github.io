          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense agreement, reinforcing their long-standing security relationship. This move is interpreted as Riyadh's strategy to diversify its security partners, reducing its traditional reliance on the United States amid growing geopolitical tensions. The pact comes as Gulf states express increasing uncertainty about the U.S.'s role as a security guarantor in the region. Analysts suggest China may view this development favorably, potentially creating new opportunities for arms sales in an increasingly complex security landscape.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine key behaviors that help children develop strong social skills. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, the approach emphasizes creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection at home. Key practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. The article suggests these foundational interactions are more effective than direct instruction for raising emotionally intelligent and socially adept individuals.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is taking on his most ambitious acting role yet, portraying mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." In a recent interview, Johnson revealed that he tapped into personal childhood trauma to play the character, who struggled with addiction and depression. He admitted to being scared to take on such a raw, dramatic part, a departure from the box-office action films he is known for. Johnson views this role as the start of a "new book" in his career, one focused on more fulfilling and challenging performances.</p>

          <p>The article recounts the historical significance of the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. It traces the legal battle led by NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall, which culminated in the unanimous decision to overturn the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case. This landmark decision declared state-sponsored segregation in public schools unconstitutional, marking a pivotal moment in the American civil rights movement. While the ruling did not immediately end segregation, it provided the legal foundation for dismantling systemic racial discrimination in the United States.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, narrowing the championship gap. The race was marked by an early exit for McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the current championship leader, who crashed on the first lap. Piastri's main rival and teammate, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic. The results suggest a potential resurgence for Red Bull, while Mercedes' George Russell drove an excellent race to finish second, and Carlos Sainz secured Williams' first podium since 2021.</p>

          <p>The Seabed 2030 project aims to create a complete map of the world's ocean floor, of which only about 20% has been surveyed with modern technology. This endeavor could reveal undiscovered geological features and ecosystems, and provide insights into past sea-level rise. However, the ambitious project faces significant hurdles, including vast costs, geopolitical tensions, and a lack of resources, making its 2030 goal unlikely. Furthermore, a complete map raises concerns that it could accelerate the exploitation of deep-sea resources, prompting calls for strong international conservation agreements to protect this largely unexplored frontier.</p>

          <p>New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral has unveiled its first major new artwork in 75 years, a large-scale mural by artist Adam Cvijanovic. Titled "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding," the piece was initially conceived to depict a 19th-century religious apparition but evolved into a broader celebration of immigration. The mural features historical church figures, 19th-century immigrants, and portraits of present-day arrivals, serving as a statement on treating all people with dignity. Cardinal Timothy Dolan endorsed the theme, connecting the immigrant experience to the core of the church's history and mission in America.</p>

          <p>Companies in traditional sectors of the technology industry, such as hard disk drive and memory chip manufacturing, are experiencing a significant stock market rally. Seagate Technology and Western Digital, makers of hard drives, have seen their stocks soar by 156% and 137% respectively this year, while memory chip maker Micron is up 93%. This surge is driven by the unrelenting demand for AI computing infrastructure, which requires massive data storage solutions. While some see this as a broad-based benefit of the AI boom, others view it as a potential sign of a market bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has entered the top 10 of the UN's Global Innovation Index for the first time, an achievement seen as evidence that U.S. efforts to contain its technological rise are failing. The article argues that instead of stifling China, American pressure through export controls and blacklisting has catalyzed its drive for self-sufficiency. This is demonstrated by China's massive increase in domestic research and development spending, which now positions it as the world's second-largest R&D spender. The author suggests this outcome reveals the futility of a zero-sum approach to technological competition.</p>

Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022, with Buffett citing a desire to reallocate the money to investments he felt better about, possibly influenced by geopolitical risks associated with China.

Fertility doctors and other experts argue that this knowledge gap could be addressed by incorporating comprehensive fertility education into school sex-ed programs. Such curricula would teach students not only about pregnancy prevention but also about the factors affecting fertility, such as age and lifestyle. While some states are beginning to mandate lessons on menstruation, broader efforts face political and financial hurdles, despite evidence that young people desire more complete information about their reproductive health.</p>
