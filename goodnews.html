          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a threatened tariff escalation by the Trump administration. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on many EU imports, which is half of the previously threatened rate, and includes provisions for tariff-free trade on certain products like aircraft. As part of the agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over the next three years. Negotiations are still ongoing for some specific items, such as potential exemptions for European wine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to strengthen their roster by acquiring a position player, with a particular focus on improving their outfield defense before the trade deadline. Despite their high-powered offense, the team has struggled in July, and defensive liabilities have become a concern. Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, known for his premium defense and solid offensive season, has emerged as a potential target. The move would aim to provide better support for the Dodgers' strong pitching staff as they prepare for a potential postseason run.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Terry Bollea, known as Hulk Hogan, legal experts are examining the lasting impact of his landmark lawsuit against Gawker Media. The 2016 case, which resulted in a $140 million verdict for Hogan over the publication of a sex tape, is seen as a pivotal moment for media law and privacy rights in the internet age. While it didn't set new legal precedent, the case established clearer boundaries on publishing explicit content, even if newsworthy. It served as a significant warning to media outlets and reinforced privacy rights for both celebrities and ordinary citizens.</p>
