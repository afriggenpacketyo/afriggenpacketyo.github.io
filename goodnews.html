          <p>Chinese government scientists have announced the results of a successful weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4 percent across more than 8,000 square kilometers in a single day.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches and ultra-processed foods, arguing that it contributes to the maternal guilt industrial complex. The author, a mother herself, expresses concern over the weaponization of foodwork, which disproportionately burdens women and reinforces traditional gender roles. She challenges the notion that mothers who occasionally use pouches are lazy or neglectful, emphasizing the importance of balancing time, labor, and sanity in parenting. The author advocates for a broader societal approach that supports parents through improved leave policies, accessible childcare, and community resources, rather than solely focusing on individual food choices.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's goal of becoming prime minister is gaining credibility after Reform's recent electoral successes, challenging the traditional two-party system in the UK. Reform's wins in local elections and ahead-of-the-curve poll numbers are prompting both Labour and the Conservatives to re-evaluate their strategies. While Labour must prove its ability to govern effectively, the Tories face the challenge of regaining voter trust and defining a clear path forward. The success of Reform UK highlights public disillusionment with the political system, raising questions about the future of British politics.</p>
