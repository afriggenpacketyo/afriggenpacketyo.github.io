          <h2>Swiss Citizens Vote on Introduction of Government-Run Electronic ID System</h2>

          <p>For the second time, Swiss voters are deciding on the implementation of a national electronic identity card system in a nationwide referendum. A previous proposal was rejected in 2021 over data privacy concerns and the involvement of private companies. The revised, government-backed plan makes the e-ID optional, keeps it entirely in public hands, and stores data on users' smartphones rather than in a central database, aiming to ease privacy fears while simplifying online transactions and verifications.</p>

          <p>A neck injury to European golfer Viktor Hovland at the Ryder Cup has brought attention to the rarely used "envelope rule." This procedure is invoked if a player must withdraw from the final day's singles matches due to injury or illness. At the start of the day, each captain secretly submits the name of one player in a sealed envelope; if an opponent withdraws, that named player must also sit out, and the match is declared a half-point tie for each team.</p>

          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker and its suppliers recover from a debilitating cyberattack that has halted production for weeks. The prolonged shutdown has cost the company millions and threatened the solvency of smaller businesses in its supply chain. This financial support, aimed at protecting thousands of jobs across the UK, is believed to be the first time a government has provided such assistance to a company as a direct result of a cyberattack.</p>

          <p>Residents of Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums due to concerns about noise and air pollution. If the measure passes, gas-powered models would be completely banned. The use of electric devices would be permitted only from October to December, with special permissions required at other times, as supporters advocate for a return to using traditional rakes to protect the environment and reduce public nuisance.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could have the unintended consequence of driving high-skilled tech talent to the Middle East. Gulf countries, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are heavily investing in becoming global AI hubs and are offering attractive incentives like long-term golden visas, reduced regulations, and high compensation packages. These business-friendly environments could make the region a prime beneficiary of stricter U.S. immigration policies for skilled workers. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece suggests that these strengths are valuable and that the world has much to learn from autistic individuals.</p>
