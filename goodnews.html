          <p>Nicole Brown, a police officer in Orange County, California, has been charged with 15 felonies related to workers' compensation insurance fraud after falsely claiming she was unable to work due to a head injury. Prosecutors allege that Ms. Brown collected over $600,000 in compensation while engaging in strenuous activities like running races, skiing, and dancing at a music festival. Her stepfather, Peter Gregory Schuman, was also charged with conspiring with Ms. Brown in the fraudulent scheme. Ms. Brown's lawyer maintains that her on-duty injury continues to cause her severe limitations, and she intends to vigorously defend against the charges.</p>

The momentum of the green transition can drive progress across political and economic divides, as clean energy and climate-smart investments are not only environmental imperatives but also economic opportunities.

Prosecutors accused him of starting three fires within an hour, with the third becoming the Line fire, which forced the evacuation of over 11,000 residents and damaged multiple properties. The conviction was praised by San Bernardino County Supervisor Dawn Rowe for sending a message that arsonists will be held accountable.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China. Cases have been reported in international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia, and the New York City area, with the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. Preliminary data suggest the variant is more transmissible but not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise. The FDA is considering updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons in response.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, bolstered by surging rice prices, marking the highest level since January 2023, as the central bank considers pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, steady from the prior month and staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his stance on intending to raise rates given price trends, while also citing the need to monitor closely the effects of U.S. tariffs. An economist expects core inflation to ease in coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation.</p>

The prince and Sir David share a passion for conserving the natural world, and have supported each other's projects in the field.

The forecast is influenced by factors such as the neutral phase of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, warmer than average ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear.
