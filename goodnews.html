          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Norris expressed a desire for a larger performance gap, noting the high-speed Monza circuit presents a different challenge compared to tracks where McLaren has previously dominated. The session saw several drivers, including Norris's teammate Oscar Piastri, testing the limits of the track, while a spin by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli briefly brought out a red flag. The close timings suggest a competitive weekend ahead for the teams.</p>

The company reported that sales on its platform increased 130% from Wednesday to Thursday, with 15 million tickets ordered during the current jackpot run. This enthusiasm highlights the value of DraftKings' 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket, which the company sees as a key tool for cross-selling customers to its sports betting and iGaming offerings.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This marks the lowest rate since early October and breaks a months-long trend of rates hovering in the high 6% range. For a homebuyer purchasing a median-priced home, this decrease could translate into a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this drop will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty continue to sideline many potential buyers.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the antitrust lawsuit filed by Newsmax against Fox News, citing it as an improper "shotgun pleading" where each count incorporated all previous allegations. However, Judge Aileen Cannon is allowing Newsmax to refile an amended version of the complaint by a new deadline. The lawsuit, filed just two days before its dismissal, accuses Fox News of monopolistic practices and using intimidation tactics to suppress conservative media competitors. Newsmax has stated that it considers the dismissal a technical matter and intends to refile the lawsuit as permitted by the court.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has announced the seizure of more than 40,000 pounds of cocaine over the past month as part of its enhanced counter-drug operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The operations, part of a surge called "Operation Pacific Viper," resulted in over a dozen interceptions and the apprehension of 36 suspected drug smugglers. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that was intercepted. This effort is part of a broader strategy to disrupt illicit drug shipments from South America before they reach American shores.</p>

          <p>A recently captured image from the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The image reveals that the comet's coma and tail have become significantly more extended, indicating it has grown more active as it approaches the sun. Scientists used the observation to analyze the wavelengths of light from the comet, which provides clues about its chemical composition and how it changes during its journey. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock price jumped 11% after the company announced it had secured a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major customer. While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts at several firms, including Mizuho and Cantor Fitzgerald, believe it is the AI startup OpenAI. This massive order has significantly boosted Broadcom's revenue forecast for AI-related products, with shipments expected to begin in 2026. The news underscores Broadcom's strengthening position, alongside Nvidia, as a leading supplier for the hardware powering the artificial intelligence industry. (not investment advice)</p>

She also discusses how her mother fought for her to have creative control at a time when the industry was dominated by male executives.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot will face a substantial tax liability, regardless of whether they choose the lump sum or annuity option. The cash option, valued at $826.4 million, would be subject to a mandatory 24% federal withholding, immediately reducing it by nearly $200 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a significant additional tax bill will be due. State taxes could further reduce the take-home amount, though some states do not tax lottery winnings, creating different outcomes depending on where the ticket was purchased.

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local ordinance that banned the development of homeless shelters, settling a lawsuit brought by the state's Attorney General. The state had sued the Los Angeles County community, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. As part of the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies. State officials said the outcome demonstrates their resolve to challenge cities that attempt to block housing and services for homeless residents.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to a historic $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows where winners can maximize their take-home prize. Due to varying state tax laws, the net payout differs significantly across the country. States with no income tax or those that exempt lottery winnings, such as California, Florida, and Texas, offer the highest potential returns. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the winner receive a substantially smaller amount after both federal and state taxes are deducted. The odds of winning the grand prize remain extremely low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Financial planners are moving away from one-size-fits-all retirement advice, instead suggesting that a "good" monthly income is relative to an individual's lifestyle, location, and health. A common guideline is to aim for 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement income. However, the median retirement income in the U.S. is closer to $3,900 per month, significantly less than what many may need, especially in high-cost areas. To bridge this gap, this article suggests strategies like optimizing Social Security benefits, considering annuities for guaranteed income, and exploring reverse mortgages for homeowners to supplement their retirement portfolios.

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth as much as $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan would award Musk 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and hitting high-volume production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. The board argues the new award is necessary to retain and incentivize Musk through the company's next critical growth phase.</p>

The album was created with many of the same producers as its predecessor and includes guest appearances from artists like Tems and Lil B.

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, investors are being advised to consider strategies to protect their significant portfolio gains from potential market volatility. While a Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated, a weakening labor market could signal broader economic trouble ahead. Experts suggest that investors re-evaluate their concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which dominate major indexes, and consider rotating some capital into value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked during the recent rally. This doesn't require a major portfolio overhaul, but rather strategic adjustments to insulate returns from a potential downturn. (not investment advice)</p>
