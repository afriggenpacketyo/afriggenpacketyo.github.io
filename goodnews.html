          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery, was used on a 67-year-old patient paralyzed by a stroke, helping them to regain some limb movement. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature through a neck vein. This development presents a potentially safer and faster-recovering alternative to methods like those used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, marking a significant step in neurotechnology.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, claiming the best record in Major League Baseball despite what their manager described as a flawed performance. The team overcame a short outing from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors, thanks to key offensive contributions, including home runs by Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy. A game-tying triple by Ohtani and a go-ahead single by Mookie Betts in the fifth inning secured the lead. The bullpen managed to hold off the Royals, culminating in a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has firmly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca emphasized his high regard for the academy product, viewing him as a potential top defender for Chelsea in the long term. Acheampong, who signed a new five-year contract last year, had a breakthrough season and is expected to remain with the first team. The manager's plan is for Acheampong to continue his development at Stamford Bridge, dismissing suggestions that the young player is frustrated with his situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research, conducted among nearly 12,500 employees, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between these dietary patterns and improved mental well-being. Researchers noted that specific components, such as the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables, may contribute to these positive effects by influencing neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, was called the worst in recent state history by the governor. The escape occurred when inmates exploited a faulty cell door and crawled through a hole behind a toilet. Authorities have arrested at least 16 other individuals accused of aiding the inmates' escape.</p>

The initial images have already revealed hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation.

Feeling isolated for years, she spent hundreds of hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had known in elementary school but had grown distant from. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had paid more attention to her.

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan struck down the order against Susman Godfrey, marking another legal defeat for the president's campaign to punish law firms for representing clients he opposes or employing attorneys he dislikes. The ruling found the order violated the firm's First and Fifth Amendment rights and was an assault on the legal system.
