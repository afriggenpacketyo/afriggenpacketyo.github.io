          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods exported to the US. This agreement averts a threatened 30% tariff that was set to be imposed by the Trump administration. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to a $600 billion investment in the US and the purchase of $750 billion in American energy, including liquified natural gas, oil, and nuclear fuels. Both US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised the agreement for fostering stability and strengthening economic ties. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent stock decline following a positive earnings report, this article argues for retaining Honeywell shares, citing the company's long-term potential. The analysis points to the upcoming split of the conglomerate into three distinct companies, a strong aerospace division, and its advanced quantum computing business as key value drivers. The author attributes the stock's underperformance to market impatience and a lack of understanding of the company's complex structure, which the split aims to rectify. The author expresses conviction that the market has overreacted and that the company's fundamentals remain strong, drawing parallels to past missed opportunities with companies like Oracle and Emerson.

          <p>Bubba Wallace secured a historic victory at the Brickyard 400, becoming the first Black driver to win on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's oval track. The win, his third in the NASCAR Cup Series, snapped a 100-race winless streak for the 23XI Racing driver. Wallace expertly managed his fuel and held off a late charge from Kyle Larson through two overtime restarts to claim the title. The significant victory at one of NASCAR's premier events provides a major boost for the team co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses China's capacity to navigate its current economic and political challenges, which she terms a "polycrisis." She suggests that China can transform this into a "polytunity," or a moment of multiple opportunities for adaptive development. Ang, an influential scholar on China's political economy, also reflects on the state of China expertise in the United States. She expresses concern over a potential decline in deep understanding, contrasting the current situation with the historical efforts made by figures like Michel Oksenberg to build a robust community of American experts on China.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with US President Donald Trump in Scotland, with discussions expected to focus on the new transatlantic trade deal and the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Downing Street indicated that Starmer will press for urgent progress on a ceasefire in the Middle East, navigating a diplomatic path between the US position and that of European allies. The meeting will also provide an opportunity to refine the recently announced US-UK trade agreement, with the Prime Minister likely seeking to lower outstanding tariffs on key imports like steel.

          <p>An analysis of the new US-EU trade agreement suggests that both Washington and Brussels can claim a victory, though crucial details are still lacking. For the EU, the 15% tariff is better than the threatened 30%, while the US secures significant revenue and a commitment of $600 billion in new investment. The article notes that President Trump's personal involvement was key to finalizing the deal, which rebalances a trade relationship he has long criticized as unfair. However, questions remain about the timeline and specifics of the EU's investment, and the deal sets the stage for upcoming trade negotiations between the US and China. (not investment advice)</p>

The shift allowed other properties, such as the "Alien" franchise and the anime "Demon Slayer," to take center stage.

While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously supported the idea of a celebratory day off for such an achievement, the government is likely considering the economic cost, previously estimated to be over £1 billion.

          <p>The US and EU have announced a trade deal after a tense 40-minute meeting at Donald Trump's golf resort in Scotland, averting a potential trade war. The agreement sets a 15% baseline tariff for most EU exports, though a punitive 50% tariff on steel remains. In return, the EU will purchase $750 billion in US energy products and invest $600 billion in the US. The deal notably creates a trade division on the island of Ireland, as Northern Ireland will benefit from a lower 10% tariff rate, raising diplomatic questions about the Good Friday agreement's economic stability guarantees.
