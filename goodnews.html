          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules. The Kentucky Board of Stewards determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times with his riding crop, exceeding the permitted maximum of six times. This marked Alvarado's second violation within 180 days, leading to a doubled fine under HISA's escalating penalty structure. All jockey crop fines are allocated to a jockey mental health program. Sovereignty will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to compete in the Belmont Stakes.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between U.S. and Chinese delegations regarding tariffs concluded after a day of extended discussions and will continue on Sunday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met in Switzerland to address trade tensions impacting the global economy. Initial discussions likely focused on de-escalation, given the unsustainable tariff levels imposed by both countries. While no immediate progress was reported, the talks represent an effort to scale back the massive taxes on each other's goods. President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have pushed for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>
