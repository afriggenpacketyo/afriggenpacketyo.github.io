        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Quarterback Joe Milton, recently acquired by the Dallas Cowboys from the New England Patriots, has expressed high praise for his new team's environment. He highlighted the supportive nature of starting quarterback Dak Prescott, noting that Prescott goes out of his way to help him, a stark contrast to his experience in a "different building." Milton indicated that the move was a "fresh start" that he and his agent orchestrated, suggesting dissatisfaction with his previous situation. After appearing in only one game for the Patriots last season, Milton is now projected to be the backup quarterback for the Cowboys, embracing his new role.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 10:00:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new "Trump IRA" proposal, part of a recent bill, aims to encourage savings for children under 18 by allowing parents and employers to contribute up to $5,000 annually. The accounts would grow tax-free, and funds could be withdrawn penalty-free at age 18, with the government adding a $1,000 starter for children born between 2025 and 2028. However, this article suggests that while the free $1,000 is worth taking, other savings vehicles like 529 education accounts and custodial Roth IRAs offer more significant long-term benefits. These alternatives provide more robust options for funding education or retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Performer Michael Feinstein reflects on his 50-year career championing the Great American Songbook, from his early days as a self-taught pianist to becoming Ira Gershwin's archivist. His passion led him to establish the Great American Songbook Foundation in Indiana, which includes a museum and a summer academy for young performers. Feinstein believes the songbook is an evolving tradition, including artists like Carole King and Billy Joel alongside classics from the Gershwins and Cole Porter. He continues to perform and collaborate, working to ensure that this rich musical legacy is passed on to the next generation.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas is making her directorial debut with "My Mother's Wedding," a film she co-wrote that draws from her own childhood experiences with loss. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, centers on three daughters grappling with their past as their mother prepares for her third marriage. In an interview, Thomas discusses how the deaths of her father and stepfather when she was young inspired the screenplay and her journey from being "excruciatingly shy" to an acclaimed star.

          <h2>Four-Day Workweek Boosts Happiness by Increasing On-the-Job Effectiveness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant improvements in employee well-being, but the reason extends beyond just having more free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a major factor in increased happiness is that employees feel more effective and productive at work. Faced with less time, teams are forced to eliminate busywork and streamline processes, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control over their professional lives. This boost in work quality and efficiency has a profound positive impact on overall well-being, fostering better team spirit and motivation.</p>

          <h2>Exhibitions Celebrate the Monumental and Monochromatic Sculptures of Louise Nevelson</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:25:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic work of sculptor Louise Nevelson (1899-1988) is being celebrated in new exhibitions at the Whitney Museum in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art. Known for her massive, monochromatic sculptures created from found objects, Nevelson's path to recognition was a decades-long journey. Her granddaughter recalls her as an "unconventional" figure who would "dumpster dive" for materials, transforming street garbage into monumental art. Curators note that by painting her assemblages a single color, she created immersive, unified experiences that turned humble objects into something historic, pursuing her artistic vision fiercely until her death at 88.</p>

          <p>After a tumultuous period, Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to helm the company a year ago. The manufacturer's stock is up over 30% this year, with aircraft production increasing and deliveries at an 18-month high. Ortberg has focused on changing the company culture, cutting costs, and improving quality control, earning praise from airline customers like Ryanair's CEO who noted dramatic improvements. While challenges remain, including FAA production caps and delays on new models, analysts expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year.</p>

          <h2>Matt Dawson Argues British and Irish Lions Must Secure a Series Whitewash for Legendary Status</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former rugby player Matt Dawson, in his column, contends that for the current British and Irish Lions team to be truly celebrated for decades, they must complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While acknowledging their special achievement in winning the series, he suggests the ultimate legacy depends on this final victory, a feat not accomplished on a tour since 1927. Dawson contrasts this with his own 1997 Lions team, which won the series 2-0 but lost the final test, admitting they were caught up in euphoria. He praises the current squad's mindset and urges them to make necessary team changes to hit their goal.</p>
