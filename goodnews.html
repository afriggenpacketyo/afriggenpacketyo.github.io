          <h2>Ketamine Therapy Gains Attention Amidst Debate Over Its Use and Safety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 14:55:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ketamine therapy is gaining traction as an alternative treatment for depression, particularly treatment-resistant depression, with some reality stars touting its benefits for relationships. While a derivative of ketamine has been FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation, experts caution about potential risks, including adverse health issues and addiction. The drug is believed to create more connections between brain cells, potentially easing depression and suicidal thoughts, but should be administered under medical supervision. Experts emphasize that ketamine therapy should be seen as a step toward healing rather than a quick fix, and that its use should be carefully monitored by medical professionals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, aiming to build emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Unlike other approaches, it prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents, encouraging them to accept their child's emotions without dismissing them. The method sees misbehavior as a signal for support, setting boundaries with empathy rather than control, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair after conflicts. The article advocates for parents to reflect on their own childhood experiences and triggers to create a steady, safe space for their children during emotional storms.</p>

          <p>Tennis player Tommy Paul humorously recounted his experience of having his truck repossessed due to missed payments after winning his first-round match at the French Open. Paul explained that he had switched banks and forgotten to update his automatic payments, resulting in the repossession of his Ford F-150. He learned about the incident when his trainer asked him to check security footage for packages, only to discover his truck being towed away. Despite the initial shock, Paul managed to recover the truck and shared the amusing anecdote with reporters.</p>
