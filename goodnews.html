Analysts say this will likely pressure the government to shift further to the right on issues like immigration.

          <p>CBS News reports that lenders offer differing rates for home equity loans and HELOCs due to several factors. Home equity loans have fixed rates, which command a premium because lenders assume the risk of future rate increases. HELOCs, on the other hand, offer lower variable rates that change with economic conditions. Flexible draw periods and ongoing borrowing risk also contribute to the rate differences. Despite the rate differences, both home equity products can offer better interest rates and higher borrowing limits compared to credit cards or personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement aims to deepen ties and underscores British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's ambition for a "reset" of relations with the EU. The deal includes easier border crossings for British people, simplified pet travel, and the resumption of some British meat product sales in the EU.

          <p>BBC News analyzes the potential economic impact of the new UK-EU deal, which aims to "reset" the relationship between the UK and the EU. While the deal represents a significant breakthrough in deepening ties, it dismantles only a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit. The agreement on plant and animal health is expected to reduce red tape and checks, benefiting those producing and selling foodstuffs. The government claims the agreement will be worth ¬£8.9bn to the UK by 2040, but analysts say it will only recoup a small fraction of the GDP lost due to Brexit.</p>
