          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have provided details regarding the U.S. operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, which involved bombing three nuclear sites in Iran. The mission included seven B-2 Spirit bombers, in-flight refuelings, and the deployment of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a U.S. submarine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the strikes on the Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan "an incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people. According to Hegseth, the operation demonstrated that American deterrence is back, and the world should listen when the president speaks.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that "Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" following U.S. strikes on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. He emphasized that the mission was a precision operation to neutralize threats to national interest posed by the Iranian nuclear program and to defend U.S. troops and ally Israel. Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine confirmed "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Caine stated that the full extent of the damage would take time to assess, but initial reports indicated significant destruction across all three sites.</p>
