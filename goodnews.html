        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global oil prices experienced a notable decline amid two significant developments: the resumption of crude exports from Kurdistan and reports indicating that OPEC+ plans to increase its oil output. The return of Kurdistan's oil to the international market adds substantial supply, while a potential hike in production from OPEC+ members signals a broader boost in global oil availability. This dual development suggests a notable shift in market dynamics, potentially leading to lower prices for consumers and impacting energy-dependent economies worldwide. The article indicates a move towards increased supply, which could ease inflationary pressures but poses challenges for oil-producing nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article offers practical advice on identifying and managing friendships with "energy vampires," individuals who consistently drain emotional energy through excessive complaining, self-absorption, or a constant need for attention. Psychologists and journalists suggest that recognizing how one feels after interactions—often drained or unheard—is a key indicator. Effective strategies include engaging in honest conversations about unmet needs, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent and topics discussed, and proposing alternative activities that reduce their ability to dominate. The article emphasizes the importance of protecting one's personal well-being and maintaining healthier interpersonal dynamics within challenging relationships.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy, emphasized that establishing a reliable supply chain for green methanol is paramount for Hong Kong to achieve its ambitious goals in sustainable marine fuels. While the city has successfully implemented liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling operations, green methanol requires a dedicated effort to facilitate its tax-free import, storage, and sale, likely involving mainland China. The company's new dual-fuel vehicle carrier, CM Hong Kong, already utilizes a quarter green methanol despite its current higher cost. The article underscores the increasing importance of green fuels driven by European carbon emission tariffs and the strategic challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, secured a clear victory and a new parliamentary majority in an election deemed critical for the country's path toward the European Union. The electoral process was significantly overshadowed by claims of "massive Russian interference," including bomb scares at polling stations and arrests related to plots for post-election unrest. Despite facing internal challenges such as spiraling prices and high levels of corruption, Moldovans largely voted in favor of a European future. This article underscores the ongoing geopolitical struggle in the region, with Russia accused of attempting to destabilize the democratic process.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, is set to announce a new plan guaranteeing paid work placements for young people who have been unemployed or out of education for 18 months, with benefit sanctions for refusal. This initiative aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, building upon a previous "youth guarantee" for 18-21-year-olds. The scheme will involve collaborations with private companies, which are anticipated to cover a portion of the wages, and will be funded from existing government budgets. The article highlights the government's focus on addressing youth unemployment and fostering a society based on "contribution" and "fair reward," though questions remain about businesses' capacity to absorb large numbers of new workers.</p>
