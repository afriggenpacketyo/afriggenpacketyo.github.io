          <p>British officials are proceeding with trade negotiations with the U.S. despite a court ruling that overturned many of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The UK hopes to finalize deals covering cars, metals, and airplane parts within weeks. While a federal court initially ruled the tariffs illegal, an appeals court paused the ruling, allowing the Trump administration to maintain them. The UK aims to implement the trade deal as quickly as possible, even as some companies face pressure to reduce prices. Trump unexpectedly announced he would be doubling foreign tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50%.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, but their travel habits are evolving. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, more travelers seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The shift is driven by travelers in their 30s and 40s, opting for family trips. The Japan National Tourism Organization is targeting this market with social media engagement, while visitor numbers from Hong Kong rebounded strongly in April after concerns about a manga predicting a major disaster.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump praised Nippon Steel Corp. for committing to invest $14 billion in United States Steel Corp. and protect the jobs of American workers. During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump called the Japanese company a "great partner" for the iconic but struggling producer. He also said he will raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent from the 25 percent that his administration imposed in February along with an impost of the same rate on aluminum from most countries, citing national security.

The 13-metre (43-foot) radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was officially inaugurated in Chiang Mai on May 16. Together with a second telescope under construction in Songkhla, southern Thailand, the station will enhance deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research and earthquake forecasting.</p>
