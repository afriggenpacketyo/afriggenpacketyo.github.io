          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has broken ground on its fifth terminal, expected to be operational by the mid-2030s, as Asia prepares for a travel boom. Terminal 5 will almost double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity from 90 million to 140 million passengers per year, solidifying Changi's position as a mega airport. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized the importance of this expansion in connecting Singapore to 200 cities, up from the current 170, and boosting the aviation ecosystem, which contributes 5% of Singapore's GDP. This development is part of a broader trend of airport expansions in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions, with investments totaling $240 billion between 2025 and 2035.</p>

          <p>US lawmakers are considering restructuring the State Department to better align economic and foreign policy goals as major economies begin to work around the United States due to Washington's departure from established global trading rules. During a House subcommittee hearing, witnesses and lawmakers agreed on the need for closer economic engagement with trading partners, particularly to counter China‚Äôs growing influence.

          <p>A manuscript once dismissed as an unofficial "copy" of the Magna Carta, acquired by Harvard Law School for just $27.50 in 1946, is now believed to be a genuine version from 1300, during the reign of King Edward I. Two UK academics, Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, identified it as an extraordinarily rare original, potentially worth millions. The document, catalogued as HLS MS 172, was initially described in an auction catalogue as a "copy made in 1327," but research revealed that its handwriting, dimensions, and text align with other known 1300 originals, making it a significant discovery in constitutional history.</p>

          <p>This article from the New York Times analyzes winning acts since 2000 to provide a guide to winning Eurovision. Key elements include singing about personal liberation, using English lyrics, alluding to folk music without sending a pure folk song, avoiding dramatic key changes, and going all-out on staging with fire or pyrotechnics. The article cautions against sending novelty acts, highlighting that while they can become part of Eurovision folklore, they rarely win. The article suggests that blending traditional music with an exhilarating pop chorus can pay dividends.</p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal asserts that China possesses the financial strength to establish a market stabilisation fund, citing the nation's robust economy and substantial foreign exchange reserves. The Study Times article emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the market amid economic uncertainties caused by trade tensions. It suggests that the fund would help reduce market volatility and protect investors, drawing parallels with successful interventions during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, with recent trade talks between Chinese and US officials leading to a temporary suspension of tariff increases.</p>

The new law, set to take full effect in December, prohibits these companies from using data obtained from their app stores or operating systems to gain an advantage in their own products. The law also aims to prevent unfair treatment of software suppliers wishing to transition apps between stores, with the goal of benefiting consumers through reduced prices and improved app access.</p>
