          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention, determining he is not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, and his attorneys argued his detention was "highly unusual." The judge criticized the Department of Homeland Security for detaining Khalil based on allegations he omitted details from his green card application and suggested the immigration charge was being used to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. The government is likely to appeal the decision, but the judge did not order electronic monitoring of Khalil.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits in President Trump's proposed legislation. Murkowski emphasized that she has not issued any absolute deal-breakers but has communicated her reservations about the Medicaid proposals. She noted that cuts harming Alaskan beneficiaries are unacceptable, given Alaska's high healthcare costs and the significant percentage of children on Medicaid. Murkowski supports addressing entitlement spending but opposes doing so at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p>
