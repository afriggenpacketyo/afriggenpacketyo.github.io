          <p>A federal judge sided with transgender plaintiffs against a Trump executive order, granting a preliminary injunction that requires the Federal Bureau of Prisons to continue providing gender-affirming care to inmates. The order had sought to bar federal funds for medical procedures aimed at conforming an inmate‚Äôs appearance to that of the opposite sex. The judge found that the government's enforcement of the order was "arbitrary and capricious" by failing to justify the executive action while treating gender dysphoria differently than other medical conditions. The article discusses the legal challenge to the Trump administration's policies on transgender rights. The optimism score is 70.</p>
