        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin does not have to pay unemployment taxes, citing religious freedom guarantees under the First Amendment. The Catholic Charities Bureau argued that the state's requirement to pay the tax violated their religious freedom because other faith groups were exempt. Wisconsin contended that the organization's daily work did not involve religious teachings, making it ineligible for the exemption. This ruling is one of several religious-rights cases the Supreme Court is considering this term, reflecting ongoing debates about the intersection of religious freedom and government regulations.</p>

          <p>A Capgemini survey reveals that 81% of "next generation millionaires" plan to replace their parents' wealth management firms, primarily due to poor digital offerings or a lack of desired services and products. This trend is significant as over $100 trillion is expected to be transferred from older generations to heirs and spouses, with a majority of the transfers coming from millionaires and billionaires. Younger investors are more interested in crypto, private equity, and overseas investments, and they expect advanced digital offerings from their wealth managers. Wealth management firms are finding it challenging to build relationships with the next generation, who have different investment priorities and lifestyles compared to baby boomers.

The Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again Commission released a report highlighting school meals as a source of unhealthy foods contributing to childhood obesity. Kennedy's movement seeks to replace processed items with "real food, whole food, farm-fresh food," potentially eliminating popular offerings like Domino's pizza.
