Her cancers are potentially linked to the toxic dust she inhaled, and she is part of the World Trade Center Health Program. After using running to process the trauma of 9/11, her subsequent cancer diagnoses and grueling treatments tested her resolve. Now cancer-free again, she is undertaking the charity bike ride to celebrate her health and raise money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>The classic 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz" is being adapted for an immersive screening at the Las Vegas Sphere. The experience will utilize the venue's massive wraparound screen, 16K resolution, spatial audio, and 4D effects like wind and haptic seating to place audiences inside the world of Oz. Engineers used AI "outpainting" technology to expand the original film frames to fit the unique venue without altering the core content.

          <p>Despite two recent analyst downgrades to a neutral rating, the CNBC Investing Club expresses continued confidence in GE Vernova. The downgrades from Mizuho and Guggenheim were primarily attributed to the stock's significant price increase and current valuation, not fundamental weaknesses in the company's performance. In fact, Mizuho raised its price target, citing accelerating margin expansion. The analysis suggests that the company's strong order book for gas turbines remains a key positive factor for its long-term outlook, viewing the current market tepidity as a potential buying opportunity.

          <p>A new scientific study indicates that the human immune system can be triggered simply by the sight of a sick person, even a virtual one. Researchers used VR headsets to show participants avatars, some of which appeared to have a cough. Brain monitoring and blood samples revealed that when a sick-looking avatar approached, participants' brains sounded an alarm, and a type of immune cell involved in early responses became more active. This suggests the brain can prime the body for a fight against infection before a pathogen is even present, opening potential therapeutic avenues.</p>
