          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:49:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced at the White House that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly." This development comes as the administration continues its push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce includes terms for the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. Trump praised his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for his work on the negotiations, which have been ongoing with mediation from Qatari officials to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has confirmed the delivery of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package valued at A$245 million. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia is providing this equipment to help Ukraine defend against Russia's ongoing invasion. Defence Minister Richard Marles stated that most of the 49 tanks have already been transferred, with the remainder to follow in the coming months. This delivery brings Australia's total assistance to Ukraine to A$1.5 billion, underscoring its commitment to supporting Kyiv's defense efforts through aid, equipment, and sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a retired Marine Corporal, has turned a vision that helped him endure the Vietnam War into a reality for his community. During breaks in fighting, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a peaceful carousel, an image that helped him cope with the surrounding brutality. After battling PTSD for years, he began building the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, in 1986, hand-carving its animals over 26 years. Now a nonprofit, the carousel has brought joy to over a million people since opening in 2010 and has provided Harrison with profound healing and a new purpose.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation primarily targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, creating consumer protections and clear legal definitions for these digital assets, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by supporters as a way to facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions and strengthen the dollar's role in digital finance. This law is seen as a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Global Financial System Must Adapt for Tokenized Future, Says BIS Adviser</h2>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that the global financial system needs to rewrite its rules to accommodate a future dominated by tokenized assets. Shin Hyun-Song, the economic adviser for the 'central bank of central banks,' highlighted that the rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures. He noted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of these digital tokens could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and enforce know-your-customer regulations. This call for new rules comes as the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies fuels market growth and increases regulatory scrutiny worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

Founded by Jack Dorsey, Block has expanded from its popular Square payment terminals into cryptocurrency, lending, and other financial services, and its inclusion adds more technology weight to the benchmark index.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, a condition his physician described as "benign and common." CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling, aching, or heaviness. The condition affects about one in three U.S. adults and is more common with age and in those who sit or stand for long periods. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise, with minimally invasive procedures available for more serious cases.</p>

          <p>The 'California Forever' project, backed by Silicon Valley billionaires, has unveiled plans to develop a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub within its proposed new city in Solano County. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other frontier technologies, with the goal of bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the state. Project CEO Jan Sramek stated the plan is to restore the model of having research, development, and production in the same location. While supporters praise the vision for creating jobs and rebuilding the middle class, some local residents remain skeptical, viewing it as hype for a controversial development.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical comedy in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy epic inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the show is a tongue-in-cheek homage to the famous couple. The plot is loosely based on a tabloid myth from 2004 about Coleen allegedly throwing away her engagement ring. The creators insist the spoof is an affectionate tribute to the Rooneys, celebrating them as strong characters who have endured immense public scrutiny since they were childhood sweethearts.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is extending its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to eligible infants born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine given during pregnancy. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in a child's first year, and this new vaccine offers about 80% protection with a single dose. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and reduce pressure on hospitals, while also urging parents to keep up with all childhood immunizations.</p>

          <p>This article revisits a remarkable event from 2005, when a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports at the time, three lions chased off her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's crying may have been mistaken for the mewing of a lion cub, preventing the lions from attacking her. The incident was widely regarded as a miracle, especially given that lions are Ethiopia's national symbol.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:50:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a gut microbe and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria over-activates an immune protein called STING in individuals who have a less effective version of a regulatory gene, OTUD3. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The study, which used tissue and bacteria from over 100 patients, helps explain why the disease varies so much and why treatments are inconsistent, paving the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific pathway.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day trip to China, which included meetings with Premier Li Qiang, is being analyzed as a sign of Canberra's evolving strategy in navigating great power competition. The visit, which featured a CEO roundtable and a state banquet, indicates a reset in relations with Beijing after a period of tension. According to James Laurenceson of the Australia-China Relations Institute, Australia's position is not unusual in the region, as many countries seek to balance their relationships between the United States and China. The trip suggests a "stiffening of Canberra's spine" in asserting its own diplomatic path.</p>
