          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by heightened demand in anticipation of potential negative impacts from increased U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also saw a rise of 7.8%, hitting an all-time high for April. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs without passing them on to consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the tariffs remain long-term. The company expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the business year through March due to these tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court has struck down most of the tariffs imposed by President Trump, deeming them illegal and exceeding the president's legal authority. The ruling halts the 10% tariffs assessed on numerous U.S. trading partners and a separate set of tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that the tariffs were designed to address trade imbalances, which do not constitute an emergency.

Farage's proposals include tax breaks for married couples, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, and restoring winter fuel payments for all pensioners. Economists have questioned the feasibility of these policies, particularly raising the income tax threshold, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimating significant costs.

The upgraded model, released on AI model repository Hugging Face, is a reasoning model capable of executing complex tasks through logical thought processes. DeepSeek gained prominence this year after its open-source R1 model outperformed offerings from Meta and OpenAI, raising concerns about potential overspending by U.S. tech giants.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. Ryosei Akazawa, who met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, indicated that such purchases could be within the scope of the talks, although he emphasized that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different logic.
