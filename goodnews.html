        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) secured its first Champions League title, defeating Inter Milan 5-0, a win celebrated by Qatari club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi as validation of Qatar Sports Investments' long-term project. The victory, however, has renewed scrutiny of Qatar's influence in European football, with concerns raised about state ownership and human rights issues. While PSG fans seem to embrace the Qatari ownership, critics point to the club's heavy reliance on external funding and the displacement of homegrown talent. This win highlights the ongoing debate about the role of money and state influence in modern football, as well as the ethics of sportswashing.</p>

          <h2>UK Bans Disposable Vapes to Protect Youth Health and Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 19:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now banned across the UK, aiming to curb youth vaping and reduce environmental waste. While retailers can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which are considered a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. Violators face fines, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping effectively. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, its long-term health risks remain unknown, and disposable vapes have contributed to a concerning trend of non-smoking young people taking up vaping. The ban is intended to prevent future harm to a younger generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Inter Milan's defeat to PSG in the Champions League final, questions arise about the team's future and potential rebuild. The team's aging squad, with an average age of 30 years, was outmatched by PSG's younger and more energetic players. Inter president Giuseppe Marotta has indicated a shift towards investing in younger players, and coach Inzaghi acknowledged the need for more signings. The loss has fueled speculation about Inzaghi's future with the club, as he declined to commit to staying for the Club World Cup, but this is an opportunity to renew the team's focus.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, but has placed limitations on its use, restricting it to adults 65 and older and individuals aged 12-64 with specific health conditions. The new vaccine utilizes a lower dose by refining its immune target. These restrictions reflect skepticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration officials regarding vaccines. The existing vaccine, Spikevax, remains available for broader use, and the limitations may affect public perception of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
