          <h2>Egg Freezing Popularity Increasing Among Young Women to Preserve Fertility</h2>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming more popular among women to preserve their fertility, with procedures increasing sixfold from 2014 to 2023. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. It is seen as a way for women to delay motherhood and avoid compromising on their career or partner choices. However, experts caution that it is not a guarantee and can be expensive, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees. Some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, while others face criticism for potentially exploiting women's desire to delay motherhood.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular, offering women the option to delay motherhood and preserve fertility, but it comes with significant costs and is not a guarantee of success. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle. Dr. Tomer Singer predicts that egg freezing will become routine, but critics caution against relying on it and highlight the importance of discussing fertility options with gynecologists. The decision to freeze eggs is a personal one, with women needing to consider their age, attitude towards family building, and financial resources.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity, but 60 Minutes reports that it is not a guaranteed path to motherhood. The process, which involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, costs an average of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees. Success rates vary depending on age and the number of eggs frozen, with younger women having better outcomes. Experts caution that women should be aware of the costs and risks involved, and that companies should provide better support for working mothers. Some fertility clinics are also facing scrutiny for prioritizing profits over patient care.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 4% after OPEC+ agreed to surge production for a second month, leading to concerns about an oversupplied market. The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. The decision comes a month after OPEC+ surprised the market by agreeing to surge production in May by the same amount. Goldman Sachs forecasts that U.S. crude and Brent prices will average $59 and $63 per barrel, respectively, this year.</p>
