          <p>Overcapacity in China is causing producer prices to remain deflationary, leading to a potential "China shock" as cheap exports flood global markets. This influx of low-cost goods could provide relief for inflation-hit economies, offering consumers lower prices. While some countries worry about local industries being squeezed, economists suggest that the lower costs could prompt central banks to consider rate cuts. Nomura predicts that several Asian central banks may decouple from the Federal Reserve and implement further easing measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a significant cultural figure 150 years after his birth. His works, including "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," explore diverse worlds and reflect his life in exile after escaping Nazi Germany. Mann's political essays and radio speeches during and after the Nazi era addressed the German "catastrophe" and the Holocaust. His writings and steadfast opposition to fascism established a legacy of courage and democratic values. Mann's life and work highlight the importance of literature in challenging authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and slower growth amid global uncertainty. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra emphasized that the Indian economy presents strength and stability, despite holding the full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year, indicating potential for undershooting the target. Given the significant rate cut, the RBI will shift its monetary policy stance to "neutral" to balance growth and inflation effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges common myths about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs and wages, finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, revealing that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages in AI-exposed occupations. It found that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The report also indicates that AI can enrich automatable jobs, allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks, and may even benefit countries with declining working-age populations.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, hinted at initiating emergency rice imports if the government fails to bring down prices, stating that there should be no "sacred cows" in agricultural policy. This comes as the government continues releasing rice reserves to lower prices, with stockpiles expected to decrease significantly. Koizumi emphasized that emergency rice imports are one of the options to ease distribution shortages. The phrase "no sacred cows" echoes his father's reform-oriented approach as former Prime Minister. The government is aiming to boost production, prevent supply shortages, and support producers in response to rising rice prices.</p>
