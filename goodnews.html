          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 03:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocates and politicians in the UK are calling for cosmetic and skincare ingredient lists to be in English, not just Latin, to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a Latin-based system, for global consistency. However, campaigners, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue this system is inaccessible and dangerous for consumers who cannot easily identify allergens like 'Arachis Hypogaea' for peanut oil. They are pushing for labeling standards similar to those used for food, where major allergens are clearly listed and highlighted.</p>

          <p>Ousmane Dembélé has experienced a remarkable transformation at Paris Saint-Germain, becoming a pivotal player under coach Luis Enrique. Previously known for injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, the 28-year-old has thrived in a central role, showcasing a relentless work ethic and leading the team's aggressive press. This new approach has translated into a prolific season, with more goals this year than in the previous five combined, leading his coach to call him the season's best player. Dembélé's evolution from a talented but undisciplined winger to a disciplined, high-pressing attacker embodies the new culture at PSG.</p>

          <p>As he turns 18, FC Barcelona's Lamine Yamal has already made a significant impact, playing over 100 first-team games, a stark contrast to Lionel Messi's nine appearances at the same age. While he dismisses comparisons to the Argentinian legend, his performance has fueled speculation he may inherit the iconic number 10 shirt. Yamal's journey from the working-class neighborhood of Rocafonda, Mataro, is central to his identity, reflected in his goal celebration. Despite his youth, he has demonstrated remarkable improvement and a mature mindset, balancing his on-pitch ambition with a grounded family life and contributing significantly to Barcelona's recent successes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing data from two large Chinese dams on the upper Brahmaputra River in Tibet suggests they may actually increase water flow to downstream India during the dry season, contrary to fears of drought. Since 2014, measurements have shown that low-flow water levels in February rose by over 50%, with significant increases throughout the dry season. This data provides the first concrete evidence regarding the downstream impact of China's dam projects in the region. The findings are particularly relevant as Beijing has approved a new mega-dam project, which has heightened concerns in India about potential water crises.</p>
