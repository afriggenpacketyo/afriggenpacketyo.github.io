          <p>The Papal conclave has begun in the Vatican to elect a new Pope. The voting process involves each conclave member writing their choice on a paper ballot slip and depositing it into a special urn. Three scrutineers then count the votes, and the first candidate to secure two-thirds of the votes is elected as the next pope. The voting process is shrouded in secrecy, and conclave members are instructed to write their votes in handwriting that cannot be identified to ensure anonymity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has dropped aggressive options to cut Medicaid costs, bowing to pressure from Republicans and underscoring party divisions. The House budget plan calls for $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees the program, a target that would be difficult to achieve without substantial changes. Cutting federal payments for states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would save an estimated $710 billion over a decade, but would cause millions to lose coverage. The speaker suggested he was leaning against changing the way the federal government pays states to a flat fee per person.</p>

          <p>The European Union's executive arm will announce further details of its proposed countermeasures to U.S. tariffs in a Thursday update. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said the EU continues to 'prepare for any scenario' if current trade talks fail. The EU has currently paused its initial set of retaliatory measures, which target around 21 billion euros ($24.1 billion) worth of U.S. goods. Trump initially imposed a 20% 'reciprocal' tariff on all goods coming from the EU but on April 9 paused the measures for 90 days for negotiations, lowering the duty to 10% until that time.</p>
