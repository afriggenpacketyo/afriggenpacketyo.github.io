          <p>A provision to eliminate federal income tax on tips for service industry workers is a key feature of the massive budget package recently passed by the U.S. Senate. The proposal would create a new deduction for workers like restaurant servers and bartenders, though they would still be responsible for state, local, and payroll taxes. The House and Senate versions differ on details like income caps and the maximum deductible amount, and the tax cut is set to expire in 2028. Critics argue the measure would not benefit the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal tax liability.</p>

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of high food costs, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had placed on eggs. The restaurant chain implemented the temporary fee in February in response to record-high egg prices caused by a widespread avian flu outbreak that disrupted supply. The removal of the surcharge reflects the recent normalization of wholesale and retail egg prices, providing some relief to breakfast patrons. The price spike had been a notable challenge for the chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually.</p>

These positive results come despite market turbulence caused by geopolitical conflicts and aggressive trade policies.

          <p>Shares of clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, surged after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily targeting China, and industry groups warned it could cost the sector up to $7 billion. While the removal of the tax provided immediate relief to the market, industry associations remain critical of the overall bill, stating it still undermines America's clean energy manufacturing and leadership.

          <p>California has passed a major overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in a bid to accelerate housing construction and address the state's severe housing shortage. The new rules, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, will exempt most housing projects built within existing developed areas from the law's often lengthy and costly review process. While housing advocates have praised the move as a critical step to remove bureaucratic roadblocks, some environmental and social justice groups have opposed the changes, fearing they will weaken public protections and facilitate industrial development.</p>
