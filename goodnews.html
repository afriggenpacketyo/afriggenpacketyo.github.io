          <p>Following a successful Initial Public Offering where its stock climbed on the first day, financial commentator Jim Cramer suggested that Swedish online lender Klarna remains a worthwhile investment. The "buy now, pay later" company saw its shares rise 14.55% after pricing its IPO above the expected range, reaching a valuation over $17 billion. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and impressive automated underwriting standards as positive signs. While Klarna is not yet profitable, its management has focused on market expansion, and its performance is seen as encouraging for the booming IPO market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers have introduced legislation to reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," in an effort to encourage housing construction. The bill, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass's office, would significantly reduce the property transfer tax for newly constructed apartment buildings and commercial properties. Critics of Measure ULA have argued that, while intended to fund homelessness programs, it has had a chilling effect on new development. The proposed changes are also part of a political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA and other local taxes entirely.</p>

          <p>A White House official has emphasized the need for the U.S. to defend its lead in artificial intelligence against significant advances from China. Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the competitive gap has narrowed and warned of the danger of losing pre-eminence. He advocated for exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks"—which integrate chips, algorithms, and applications—to allies as a strategy to prevent China from gaining global market share. This approach is part of a broader administration plan to coordinate with allies on export controls and secure defense supply chains.</p>

          <p>Online real estate platform Opendoor announced a major leadership shake-up, appointing former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and naming co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The news was met with strong investor enthusiasm, causing the company's stock to jump over 30% in extended trading. These changes follow the recent resignation of former CEO Carrie Wheeler amid pressure from activist investors, including Rabois. The move aims to revitalize the tech-focused home-buying company, which has recently seen a surge in retail investor interest and now boasts a market capitalization approaching $6 billion.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Investigate 'Dark DNA' as Key to Peacock Spiders' Rich Diversity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 19:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. The key may lie in what is known as "dark DNA," the vast non-gene portions of the genetic code whose function is largely a mystery. Scientists theorize that this dark DNA, which is three times more abundant in these spiders than in humans, could enable rapid adaptation and speciation. By decoding the genetics behind the spiders' varied colors, songs, and mating dances, the research aims to shed light on the broader processes that generate biodiversity in the natural world.</p>

          <h2>House of Representatives Votes to Repeal Authorizations for 1991 and 2003 Iraq Wars</h2>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has voted with bipartisan support to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The measure, which passed 261 to 167, reflects a growing sentiment in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Proponents argued that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military actions without contemporary congressional approval. The amendment is attached to the annual defense spending bill, though similar efforts have previously stalled in the Senate.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to early data for 2024 from the CDC. The disease, which was the third leading cause of death in 2020, has moved down the list as overall U.S. death rates have declined for the third consecutive year. Heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death. Public health experts note that while COVID is still a significant cause of mortality, its decline reflects progress in managing the infectious disease.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials to block a lower court's ruling that allows a transgender male student to use the boys' restroom at his school. The decision permits the student to continue using the facility that aligns with his gender identity while his legal challenge against a state ban proceeds. The court's unsigned order is not a ruling on the merits of the case, but it represents a temporary victory for the student and LGBTQ+ advocates. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch noted they would have granted the state's request to enforce the ban.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service has reversed a decades-long ban and will now provide N95 respirator masks to federal firefighters battling wildfires. For years, the agency argued against their use, citing risks of heat exhaustion, despite other nations providing them and growing evidence of long-term health risks from smoke inhalation, including cancer. The policy change follows media reports and pressure from federal lawmakers who criticized the agency for neglecting firefighter health. Advocates say the move is a crucial step in acknowledging and mitigating the occupational hazards faced by crews on the front lines of increasingly intense fires.</p>

          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has suggested that the era of "super cycles" for Apple's iPhone, driven by hardware updates, is likely over. Speaking at a technology conference, Stankey argued that future consumer excitement and mass upgrades will depend on significant software advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence. He noted that without a compelling leap forward in AI that is unique from competitors, the next iPhone risks being seen as merely an incremental upgrade rather than a must-have device. His comments reflect a growing investor concern that Apple may be lagging behind rivals in the AI race.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison momentarily surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's wealthiest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison's net worth surged to $393 billion after Oracle's stock soared over 40% due to a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. The company reported a significant increase in demand from AI companies for its data centers. Although Musk reclaimed the top spot by the end of the trading day as Oracle's shares settled, the event highlights the massive wealth being generated by the AI boom.</p>
