          <p>The last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail in May has been taken into custody, concluding a months-long manhunt. Derrick Groves, 28, was apprehended by Louisiana State Police in Atlanta, Georgia, following what was described as a "brief stand-off." His capture brings an end to the extensive search for all the individuals involved in the significant security breach. Authorities have not yet released further details regarding the circumstances of his capture or the standoff itself, but confirmed all escapees are now accounted for.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks recovered on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moving toward record closes, driven by a rebound in technology and AI-related shares like Nvidia. In corporate news, industrial gas company Linde received positive analyst notes, reinforcing confidence in its performance despite macroeconomic headwinds. Meanwhile, Amazon announced a significant expansion of its healthcare services, revealing plans to install prescription medication kiosks in One Medical primary care offices. This initiative, starting in Los Angeles, aims to provide immediate access to common medications and poses a new competitive threat to traditional pharmacies like CVS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve continuing to cut interest rates, homeowners may soon find more affordable options for home equity loans. Current average rates for these loans hover around 8.2% to 8.4%, depending on the term, but strong credit may secure lower rates. The article also contrasts fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which are currently averaging below 8%. While potentially cheaper, HELOCs carry the risk of rate volatility as they are tied to market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite gold prices surging to a record high of over $4,000 per ounce, some top financial advisors maintain that stocks remain the superior long-term investment. They argue that while gold can serve as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic uncertainty and inflation, its historical returns are not as reliable or substantial as those from equities. Over a 30-year period, the S&P 500 has demonstrated a higher annualized total return compared to gold. Advisors suggest that equities offer compounding growth and dividends, which precious metals do not, recommending only a small, single-digit percentage of a portfolio be allocated to gold.

          <p>Country music legend Dolly Parton posted a video to social media to dispel rumors about her health, telling fans "I ain't dead yet." Concern grew after her sister, Freida Parton, asked for prayers on Facebook, stating the 79-year-old singer hadn't been feeling her best. In her video, Parton explained that she had to cancel some appearances to address health issues, including a kidney stone, which she had neglected following her husband's death earlier this year. She assured her followers that the issues were not major and that she is still actively working and not ready to retire.</p>

          <p>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating that the coach needs a three-year timeframe to demonstrate his capabilities. Despite a difficult start for Amorim, including a 15th-place league finish last season and an early exit from the EFL Cup, Ratcliffe dismissed speculation that his job was in immediate danger. He criticized the media's demand for "overnight success" and affirmed that the club would not be run on "knee-jerk reactions." Ratcliffe, who controls football operations, emphasized a long-term vision focused on making the club the most profitable in the world to support sustainable on-field success.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Benefits and Limitations of Single-Purpose Reverse Mortgages for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 14:03:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For older homeowners on fixed incomes, a single-purpose reverse mortgage can offer a targeted financial solution for essential expenses like property taxes or critical home repairs. Unlike more common HECM reverse mortgages, these loans are restricted to one pre-approved use and are typically offered by state or local agencies. A key advantage is that they usually have much lower fees and costs, and no monthly payments are required until the homeowner moves, sells, or passes away. However, their availability is limited, and they often have strict income qualifications, making them unsuitable for retirees needing flexible funds for general living expenses.

          <p>An editorial from The Guardian argues that it is a "moral and diplomatic imperative" for UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to attend the upcoming Cop30 climate summit in Brazil. The piece contends that with current global emissions pledges falling dangerously short of the 1.5C target, the presence of world leaders is crucial for securing stronger commitments, similar to the 2015 Paris Agreement. It dismisses fears of a political backlash from right-wing factions as cowardly, asserting that Starmer must reaffirm the UK's commitment to climate action on the world stage. The editorial also calls on other leaders from major economies to attend what it calls a critical test of leadership.</p>

          <p>Tori Dunlap, founder of the financial education company Her First $100k, recently purchased her first home at age 31 after years of advocating for the financial benefits of renting. Despite having the means to buy earlier, she credits renting with providing the flexibility needed to build her business and travel extensively. Her decision to buy was ultimately driven by a desire for stability after her landlord decided to sell her rental property. Dunlap opted for a mortgage rather than a cash purchase to maintain liquidity, illustrating her philosophy of using debt strategically as a financial tool rather than avoiding it entirely.</p>

After being found with his sister in South Carolina, Bastian was transported to New Jersey, where he was the last dog remaining at an adoption event before being taken home by his owner, Joelle Andres. Initially very withdrawn, Bastian learned to communicate using recordable buttons for words like "walk" and "treat." As part of the win, People will donate $1,000 to the Burlington County Animal Alliance of New Jersey, the organization that facilitated his rescue.</p>

          <p>Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has officially become the first billionaire in the history of the sport, according to a Bloomberg report. The 40-year-old Portuguese player's net worth is now estimated at $1.4 billion, largely propelled by his massive two-year contract with the Saudi Arabian team Al-Nassr FC, which is reportedly worth over $400 million. Unlike many other billionaire athletes whose wealth comes primarily from endorsements, Ronaldo's fortune is significantly driven by his salary. His wealth is also supplemented by numerous business ventures, including his CR7 brand, and lucrative sponsorship deals with companies like Nike and Armani.</p>
