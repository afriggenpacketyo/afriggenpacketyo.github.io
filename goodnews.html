          <p>Taiwan is set to conduct combat capability evaluations on its domestically developed kamikaze sea drone, known as the "Kuai Chi Project," later this month. The island's defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, tasking the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) with leading development. The attack vessel, equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, aims to autonomously strike enemy ships, aligning with Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy. Mass production of over 200 units is expected to begin in 2026 to bolster coastal assault operations.</p>
