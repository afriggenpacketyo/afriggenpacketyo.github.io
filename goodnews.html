          <p>President Donald Trump was present at Arthur Ashe Stadium for the U.S. Open men's singles final, watching the match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. This marked his first appearance at the prestigious tennis tournament since before he took office in 2017. The event itself featured two of the sport's top rising stars, and Alcaraz commented that having a president attend the final is a privilege for tennis. Despite some concerns about potential disruptions, the visit proceeded as a high-profile spectator event at one of the sport's major championships.</p>

          <p>England achieved a record-breaking 342-run victory over South Africa in their third one-day international cricket match, providing a significant morale boost despite having already lost the series. Young batsman Jacob Bethell delivered a breakout performance, scoring his first professional century with an elegant 110 runs, while Joe Root also contributed a century. Bowler Jofra Archer then dismantled the South African batting order in a hostile opening spell, taking four wickets as the visitors were dismissed for a mere 72 runs in a lopsided contest.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen claimed a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was highlighted by a controversial team decision at McLaren. The team ordered Oscar Piastri to yield second place to his teammate Lando Norris after a slow pit stop for Norris had unexpectedly put Piastri ahead. Although Norris had been the faster driver for most of the race, the direct intervention after a pit crew error sparked debate about fairness in racing, with Piastri audibly questioning the call before ultimately complying.</p>

The author argues that only a small segment of small businesses will be directly affected by this specific change. The article posits that the more critical factor for the economy is overall consumer health, including income and wealth levels, which will determine whether people can absorb the resulting price increases.

This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," has held steady for generations and across diverse cultures. While the study did not determine the cause, theories include shared understanding, similar environments, or the effects of social stigma.</p>
