          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35A fighter jets equipped with nuclear capabilities, bolstering NATO's airborne nuclear mission. This move marks a significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture, according to Downing Street. These dual-capability jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The decision, announced by the prime minister at a NATO summit, has been praised by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte as a robust contribution to the alliance and is expected to support 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, which confirmed new nuclear risks, with other states increasing, modernizing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals.</p>

The state offered a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029 to secure the project. The data center will create 500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction jobs, however it will also consume twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day. Entergy Louisiana is seeking approval to build three gas-fired power plants at the site to meet Meta's energy demands, representing a $3 billion investment in infrastructure.</p>

Trump dismissed the report's findings, claiming Iran had no chance to remove materials before the strikes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's position, while Democratic Senators questioned the success of the strikes.

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its chicken Snack Wrap, and Popeyes introduced new chicken wraps, signaling a resurgence of the wrap trend from the 1990s. The wrap's popularity is tied to societal anxieties about body image and dieting, offering a lower-calorie alternative to traditional sandwiches. As trends shift again, with a renewed focus on thinness and weight loss, wraps are making a comeback as a functional and seemingly virtuous food choice. The article suggests that the return of the wrap reflects a broader revival of diet culture and the aesthetic values of the '90s.</p>

          <p>The British pound is currently hovering at its highest level in over three years, driven primarily by underlying dollar weakness rather than specific strength in sterling. Analysts are divided on the potential for further upside, with some attributing the pound's rise to a recovery from the post-mini budget lows. Invesco forecasts GBPUSD to reach 1.40 in 12 months, while RBC Brewin Dolphin suggests limited near-term upside due to softer UK economic momentum (not investment advice). Barings takes a more pessimistic view, forecasting a decline in the pound against both the euro and the dollar.</p>

Rising cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices, and physical inactivity are contributing to the increase in these other heart conditions.

          <p>The Lakers and Clippers are likely to focus on selecting the 'best available' player in the NBA draft, given their current team needs and draft positions. The Lakers, without a first-round pick, will look to develop a player for their G League team. The Clippers, with the last pick in the first round, will also seek the best available player, prioritizing positional size, basketball IQ, and shooting ability. Both teams will also be focusing on the contract status of key players like LeBron James, Luka Doncic, James Harden, and others.</p>

          <p>NATO allies, including President Trump, reaffirmed their commitment to collective defense, as outlined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. However, the communique lacked a condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine, which had been included in previous statements during the Biden administration. While the document described Russia as a "long-term threat," it did not mention NATO membership for Ukraine. Allies also agreed to increase defense spending, committing to invest 5% of GDP annually on core defense requirements and security-related spending by 2035.</p>
