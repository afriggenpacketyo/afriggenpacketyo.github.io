          <p>A hawkish lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shoji Nishida, has apologized and retracted controversial remarks he made about exhibits at a war memorial in Okinawa. Nishida had suggested that the exhibits rewrote the history of the Battle of Okinawa, implying that Japanese soldiers were responsible for the deaths of the Himeyuri student corps. His comments sparked criticism from people in Okinawa and fellow lawmakers, leading to his apology and retraction. The Himeyuri student corps refers to over 200 female students and teachers who died during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while the White House is considering a baby bonus to boost America's low birth rate, more consistent investments in mothers are needed. Paid parental leave and public child care are more effective policies, improving maternal health, preventing RSV, increasing children‚Äôs education attainment, and reducing intimate partner violence. A renewed expansion of the child tax credit would also help alleviate the financial burden on families and drastically cut the child poverty rate. The author concludes that investing in mothers from pregnancy through childbirth and across the years of raising children is what will make a real difference.</p>

          <p>The devastation caused by recent fires in Los Angeles has prompted a surge in interest in alternative construction methods, such as 3D-printed houses and shipping-container ADUs, to address the urgent need for rebuilding. These methods offer potential advantages in terms of speed, cost, and disaster resilience compared to traditional wood-framed construction. Prefabrication, which involves constructing entire buildings or large portions in a factory, is gaining traction as a way to expedite the rebuilding process. However, challenges remain in terms of navigating bureaucratic hurdles, ensuring compliance with building codes, and overcoming misconceptions about the quality and safety of these alternative construction methods.</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist challenges the traditional concept of instinct, arguing that it is a confusing and unhelpful term, advocating instead for the term "species-typical" to describe behaviors common to a species. He emphasizes that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning experiences, rather than being solely determined by DNA. The article explores how seemingly instinctive behaviors, such as nest-building in birds, are influenced by the animal's body, environment, and past experiences. The neuroscientist also highlights the importance of understanding the systems in which animals function, rather than focusing solely on their minds.</p>
