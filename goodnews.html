          <p>Kenneth Vecchione, CEO of Western Alliance, has addressed investor concerns following a recent stock selloff, stating that an alleged loan fraud case is an isolated issue. The regional bank set aside $30 million in reserves for potential losses on a loan to the Cantor Group, which it is now suing for fraud. Vecchione assured analysts that the bank has reviewed its note finance portfolio and found no other irregularities, helping to calm market fears. The incident highlights ongoing investor sensitivity towards the stability of regional banks.</p>

          <p>Tesla is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating a return to revenue growth after two consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines. The company previously reported record vehicle deliveries for the quarter, though overall deliveries for the year are down compared to 2024. Investors are closely watching for updates on key initiatives, including the Robotaxi service, new lower-cost models, and the adoption of driver assistance systems in international markets. The report comes as Tesla faces challenges such as a sales slump in Europe and increased competition from other EV manufacturers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that different antidepressants can cause widely varying physiological side effects. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and compared 30 common antidepressants, noting significant differences in their effects on weight, heart rate, and cholesterol levels. For instance, some medications were associated with average weight gain, while others were linked to weight loss. The study's authors emphasize that these findings should not discourage the use of these effective treatments but rather promote a more personalized approach to prescribing them.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after her execution, the grandchildren of Ruth Ellis are seeking a posthumous pardon for her 1955 murder conviction. Ellis was hanged for killing her partner, David Blakely, whom her family's lawyers now describe as an abusive and violent partner. The application for the pardon emphasizes the long-standing physical and emotional abuse Ellis suffered, which was poorly understood at the time. Her lawyers argue that in a modern court, this context would likely lead to a manslaughter charge rather than murder, reflecting a greater understanding of domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>The NFL has officially approved the sale of a 10% minority stake in the New York Giants to Julia Koch, a transaction that values the team at a record $10.3 billion. This valuation marks the highest ever for an NFL team in a sale. The league also approved two other limited partner stake sales for the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers at high valuations. The rising team values are attributed to expectations of more lucrative media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investment into the league.</p>

She explained she was trying to avoid spilling the liquid on a bus she was about to board.

          <p>Australia secured a six-wicket victory over England in their Women's World Cup match, overcoming an early top-order collapse. After falling to 68-4, a commanding 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland (98 not out) and Ash Gardner (104 not out) guided the defending champions to their target with ease. England had posted a total of 244-9, with Tammy Beaumont top-scoring with 78, but their middle order struggled against Australia's disciplined bowling. The result serves as another demonstration of Australia's formidable depth and resilience, even with both teams having already qualified for the semi-finals.</p>
