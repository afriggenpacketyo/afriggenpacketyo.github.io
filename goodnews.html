          <p>Chinese smartphone company Honor has taken a significant step toward an initial public offering (IPO) on mainland China's A-share market. The company has completed its IPO counselling recordation with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a mandatory precursor to listing. This move coincides with what consulting firm Deloitte describes as a recovering A-share market, which has seen increased activity in the second quarter. Regulators' efforts to restore market confidence and improve the quality of new listings are seen as contributing factors to this positive trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO is strengthening its engagement with the commercial space industry through a new strategy, coinciding with a pledge from member nations to significantly increase defense spending. The alliance, which now recognizes space as an operational domain, aims to leverage private sector capabilities for communication, navigation, and surveillance. This initiative is expected to create major opportunities for defense and space companies, especially as nations work toward new spending targets. The strategy also reflects concerns over reliance on single providers like SpaceX's Starlink, prompting European efforts to develop alternative satellite communication systems.

          <p>A team of researchers in China has created a "digital embryo," a sophisticated computational model that simulates early human organogenesis. This scientific breakthrough provides a powerful new tool for understanding the complex processes of cell development and organ formation. Published in the journal *Cell*, the research aims to decode how a single fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types and to identify why abnormalities that lead to disease can occur. The scientists believe this model will be crucial for studying developmental defects and advancing regenerative medicine.</p>

The Japanese left-hander pitched five scoreless innings against the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing only two baserunners in the Cubs' 3-0 victory. Meanwhile, Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers continued his powerful season by hitting his 28th home run, the most in the National League.

          <p>Tokyo stocks saw a sharp increase on Friday, with the Nikkei 225 index climbing above the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months. The rally was fueled by easing concerns over US trade policy after the White House indicated that President Trump could extend a 90-day pause on new tariffs. Investor sentiment was further boosted by gains in the US tech sector and a perception of reduced tensions in the Middle East. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar as the demand for safe-haven assets decreased amid the positive market outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal provides a framework for implementing a previous commitment from Beijing to roll back non-tariff barriers, which had included a suspension on exports of critical minerals. These materials are vital for numerous industries, including automotive, aerospace, and defense, and the suspension had caused significant supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is replacing its infamous "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) with a new, simplified error screen featuring a black background. The change, which will roll out with Windows 11 updates this summer, is part of a broader effort to improve system resilience and make recovering from unexpected restarts easier for users. The new screen will display a more condensed error message and a restart progress percentage, removing the sad face icon.
