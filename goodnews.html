          <p>Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, which will feature royal ceremonies, political discussions, and significant trade talks. The visit is underscored by the announcement of a £31 billion investment in the UK by US tech firms, including Microsoft, aimed at boosting cooperation in AI and quantum computing. Despite the diplomatic pageantry and economic agreements, the visit has also drawn anti-Trump protestors, with demonstrations planned in Windsor. All official events are scheduled to take place within the secure confines of the Windsor estate and the Prime Minister's residence at Chequers.</p>

          <p>Google's AI application, Gemini, has claimed the top spot for free apps on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT. This milestone suggests Google is gaining significant ground in the consumer generative AI race after initially lagging behind OpenAI. Recent updates, including a new image editing feature, helped the Gemini app attract 13 million new users in just four days, bringing its total to 23 million since launch. The growing traction in consumer AI has also boosted investor confidence, with Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently joining the $3 trillion market capitalization club.</p>

Speaking at a conference, Bettman acknowledged that while shutting down the season for two weeks presents challenges, the decision was made because of the global visibility of the Olympics and the strong desire from players to compete for their countries. A new agreement with the IOC provides the league with better commercial arrangements and improved conditions for players, making the return a worthwhile endeavor for the sport's growth.</p>

          <p>A consortium of major technology companies, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, and OpenAI, has announced plans to invest over $40 billion in the United Kingdom's artificial intelligence infrastructure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022. The sharp decline occurred as investors appeared to anticipate an expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Analysts note that this situation is reminiscent of September 2024, when mortgage rates paradoxically increased after a Fed rate cut, suggesting a similar outcome is possible but not guaranteed. The move provides some potential relief for homebuyers, though experts caution that long-term rates may not be significantly impacted by the Fed's short-term adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that winning the global competition in artificial intelligence will depend less on technology alone and more on a nation's ability to educate and train its workforce. The author, drawing on experience teaching in China, emphasizes that citizens must be taught how to use AI to augment their roles across all industries, from healthcare to finance. The piece suggests that governments should focus on democratizing AI knowledge and reskilling the population to migrate from low-value to higher-level tasks. This educational foundation is presented as the core of national competitiveness in the AI era.</p>
