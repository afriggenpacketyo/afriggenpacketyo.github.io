          <h2>Job Postings Requiring Artificial Intelligence Skills See Rapid Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:39:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of job listings mentioning artificial intelligence has surged, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years, according to a new report from the Brookings Institution. In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings have more than doubled as companies increasingly integrate the technology into their operations. These roles, which span from specialized AI engineers to general software developers, offer an average pay premium of 28% compared to similar jobs without an AI requirement. While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, AI-related jobs are expanding beyond tech hubs into other sectors like finance and marketing.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of 10 beverages in hundreds of U.S. restaurants, drawing inspiration from its recently shuttered CosMc's drink-focused spinoff chain. The company aims to capitalize on the growing demand for cold, flavorful drinks, particularly among Gen Z consumers, by integrating these offerings directly into its main stores. The new drinks, including items like Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and Strawberry Watermelon Refresher, will first be available in markets such as Wisconsin and Colorado starting in September. This move represents a strategic pivot to leverage learnings from the CosMc's experiment to boost sales and attract customers during snack and afternoon breaks.</p>

          <h2>Chicano Punk Pioneers Alice Bag and Kid Congo Powers Discuss Their Enduring Legacy and New Collaboration</h2>

          <p>Alice Bag and Kid Congo Powers, influential figures from the 1970s Los Angeles punk scene, are collaborating on a new musical project called Juanita y Juan. The duo, both of whom are Mexican American, were instrumental in shaping the early punk movement but their Chicano identities were often overlooked in historical accounts of the era. In a recent interview, they discussed their shared history, their new 'loud lounge' musical style, and the importance of representing their heritage. Their project aims to blend Latin rhythms with their punk roots, continuing their legacy of breaking molds and inspiring new generations of artists.</p>

          <p>The 2025 San Diego Comic-Con International has begun, drawing tens of thousands of pop culture fans, but with a noticeable absence of major film announcements from Marvel and DC Studios. Despite this, the event will feature significant presentations, including updates on the new 'Predator: Badlands' film and the 'Alien: Earth' television series. George Lucas, the creator of 'Star Wars,' is scheduled to make his first-ever appearance at the convention to discuss his new narrative art museum. While Marvel is not presenting its film slate, it is hosting an interactive attraction for its upcoming 'Fantastic Four: First Steps' movie, which releases this week.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster demonstrated notable poise and confidence during his appearance at the Big Ten media day, a stark contrast to his awkward, unrehearsed performance a year prior. Foster, using prepared remarks, even joked about his previous appearance, stating that 'authenticity resonates more deeply than perfection.' His improved public speaking reflects a more confident phase for the program, which recovered from a poor start last season and has seen a surge in recruiting, including landing quarterback Nico Iamaleava from the transfer portal. Foster's transformation is seen by supporters as a sign of positive momentum and growing stability for the UCLA football team.</p>

          <p>USC head coach Lincoln Riley affirmed his strong desire to continue the university's historic football rivalry against Notre Dame, stating, 'Hell, yeah, I want to play the game.' Speaking at the Big Ten media day, Riley acknowledged that negotiations are complicated by uncertainty surrounding the future College Football Playoff format. The Big Ten is advocating for a model with four automatic qualifiers, which would reduce the emphasis on nonconference scheduling for playoff contention. Riley argued that preserving iconic nonconference matchups like USC-Notre Dame is a crucial reason to adopt such a format, though the two schools currently appear no closer to an agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary block on a lower-court ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that would have severely restricted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. The appeals court had ruled that only the U.S. Justice Department, not private individuals or civil rights groups, could file lawsuits under Section 2 of the act, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices. This decision, which arose from a redistricting case in North Dakota brought by two Native American tribes, conflicts with decades of legal precedent. The Supreme Court's action prevents the ruling from taking effect and signals that the justices will likely hear the case in a future term.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is recalling more than 121,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L vehicles from the 2023-2024 model years due to faulty second-row headrests. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the headrests may fail to lock in the upright position, potentially increasing the risk of injury to passengers during a crash. The company will notify owners by mail in early September. To resolve the issue, dealers will inspect the headrests and, if necessary, replace them free of charge. This recall addresses a specific safety concern related to the vehicle's passive restraint systems.</p>

          <p>The iconic heavy metal touring festival Ozzfest was created in 1996 after Ozzy Osbourne was rejected from performing at Lollapalooza, with organizers deeming him 'not relevant.' In response, his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, launched their own festival, which quickly became a premier platform for both established and emerging metal bands like Slayer, System of a Down, and Disturbed. The festival was renowned for its two-stage format that helped launch the careers of many new artists. Despite its success, the tour eventually ended in 2018 due to rising costs and disagreements with band managers over compensation.</p>

          <p>San Francisco's public transit agency, Muni, is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Grateful Dead by wrapping three of its vehicles in tie-dye and paisley designs. The themed buses and train will transport fans to the upcoming Dead & Company concert series at Golden Gate Park and will also run on regular city routes. The city funded the campaign from its marketing budget, anticipating a significant economic boost from the concerts, which generated $31 million for the city during a single show in 2023. Officials hope the creative initiative will not only celebrate the iconic band's legacy but also boost enthusiasm for public transit amid financial challenges for the agency.</p>

          <p>Ride-sharing company Lyft is rolling out a new feature that allows passengers to save drivers as a 'favorite' in the app. This function will prioritize matching riders with their favorited drivers for future scheduled trips when those drivers are available. The company says the feature is designed to give riders more control over their experience and help drivers build lasting relationships and secure more earnings opportunities. The move comes a day after competitor Uber launched a similar preference-based feature for female passengers. Lyft's 'favorite driver' option will be widely available in the U.S. and Canada by the end of August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent surveys suggest many Americans believe they need around $4 million for a comfortable retirement, a figure that is realistically unattainable for the vast majority of the population. Federal Reserve data indicates that only about 1.3% to 1.5% of U.S. households have a total net worth of $4 million or more. The median retirement savings for Americans is a much more modest $86,900. This article suggests the $4 million benchmark is often promoted by retirement calculators from investment firms, which may overestimate needs and create unnecessary anxiety. A more realistic target for most people is likely between $1 million and $2 million, supplemented by other income sources. (not investment advice)</p>

The rally was also fueled by the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney for the company's denim line. This surge provides a temporary reprieve for the stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date before the recent trading frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>
