          <p>Han Duck-soo, the former prime minister and acting president of South Korea, has announced his candidacy for president in next month's snap election, triggered by Yoon Suk Yeol's ousting. Han, a conservative, resigned as acting president to pursue the position and pledged to do his "utmost" for South Korea. He has previously served as prime minister, trade minister, finance minister, and ambassador to the US. His entry into the race heats up the competition among conservatives as they seek to unite against Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung. Meanwhile, the new acting President Lee-Ju-ho promised to ensure government stability and fair elections.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the enduring relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail." Eig argues that King's message of love and nonviolent pressure is a guide for those who disapprove of current tactics and prefer mercy for the marginalized. King believed in the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems, advocating for peaceful protests and direct action to expose injustice. Eig suggests that King would call on elected leaders to change unjust policies, employ economic boycotts, and lean on clergy to seize the moral high ground, emphasizing that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</p>

          <p>China's Labour Day holiday is seeing a surge in inbound travel, with bookings jumping 141% year-on-year, driven by relaxed visa policies and increased social media exposure. Domestic tourism is also experiencing modest growth, with cross-region trips expected to rise 8%. This travel boom is part of broader efforts to boost domestic spending amid economic pressures. However, box office sales are falling short of previous years, contrasting with the positive trend in travel demand. Authorities have rolled out measures to attract more inbound tourists, including easing tax-refund rules.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered the competitive obesity drug market by striking a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. This amylin analog mimics a hormone that increases satiety, differing from current GLP-1 drugs. Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability and muscle preservation. The deal involves co-development and co-commercialization of petrelintide as a standalone and combo therapy with Roche's CT-388, with Zealand receiving significant upfront and milestone payments. Both companies emphasize the strong scientific and cultural fit as key reasons for the agreement.</p>

          <p>China is easing its restrictions on K-pop acts, signaling a potential shift to boost domestic demand amid a trade war with the US.

The move is part of a broader strategy to revitalize domestic demand by promoting cultural events. K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible.
