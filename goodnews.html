          <p>The Trump administration has lifted most U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move aimed at reclaiming regional leverage and countering Iranian influence. The decision follows a meeting between President Trump and Syria's new transitional leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and is conditioned on Syria's cooperation on counterterrorism and distancing itself from Iran. Experts view this as a strategic calculation to stabilize the region and potentially expand the Abraham Accords, with Syria as a possible next candidate for normalization with Israel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted new laws to streamline housing construction by exempting most urban, multifamily developments from the state's lengthy environmental review process (CEQA). This move is seen as a significant shift away from the anti-growth sentiment that has historically dominated Democratic politics in the state, which contributed to a severe housing shortage. The article argues this reflects a new governing philosophy prioritizing material abundance and public interest over placating specific interest groups, offering a potential blueprint for Democrats nationwide.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Ken Casey, founder of the band Dropkick Murphys, and his outspoken opposition to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. Casey discusses his mission to preserve working-class values and push back against what he sees as a grifter's scam, even if it means losing fans. He recounts a recent concert where he challenged a Trump supporter over merchandise made outside the U.S., turning a confrontation into a moment of dialogue. Casey expresses frustration with identity politics and wishes more artists would speak out against political bullies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2023, Apple's iPhone sales in China grew, posting an 8% year-on-year increase in the second quarter. This rebound is largely attributed to aggressive price promotions and enhanced trade-in offers ahead of the country's major "618" shopping festival. Despite this positive development, Apple continues to face intense pressure from domestic competitor Huawei, which has made a strong market comeback and also saw a 12% sales increase, securing the top market share spot in China.</p>

          <p>A cultural discussion is exploring whether children can still experience the unstructured, screen-free "'90s summer" in an era of constant digital entertainment and parental supervision. While some parents are opting for fewer scheduled activities, experts note that children's free time is now dominated by devices like phones and tablets. However, the article finds that older teens are often savvy about managing their own screen time, suggesting that while a true '90s summer is impossible, today's youth are developing new ways to navigate their digital world.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports while U.S. exports to Vietnam will be tariff-free. The agreement also includes a higher 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice often associated with China. Analysts believe this deal signals that future U.S. trade agreements with other nations, particularly in emerging Asia, are likely to involve similar tariff structures rather than a return to tariff-free trade.

          <p>In her new book, "A Physical Education," author Casey Johnston details her journey from obsessive cardio and calorie counting to the empowering world of strength training. The article discusses how lifting weights reframes exercise for women, shifting the goal from shrinking one's body to building functional strength and capability. This approach requires adequate nutrition, directly challenging the restrictive mindset of diet culture. It presents weightlifting as a way to unify mind and body in the pursuit of getting stronger, rather than smaller.</p>

Investor nerves eased after Prime Minister Keir Starmer affirmed his full support for Reeves, whom markets see as a key figure for maintaining fiscal discipline. Analysts suggest the market reaction demonstrates a fear that her departure would lead to weaker control over government finances and larger deficits, thereby bolstering her political position despite the personal and political turmoil.
