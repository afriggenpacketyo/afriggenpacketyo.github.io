          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's remarks at a town hall regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to a constituent's concern about potential deaths resulting from Republican Medicaid cuts by stating, "Well, we're all going to die," and later sarcastically apologized in a cemetery. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current professional baseball player, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy, particularly its impact on Iowa soybean farmers. Democrats have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, making this a challenging but significant political contest. </p>

          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in several U.S. states, including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and others as far south as New York and Pennsylvania. The sun's current maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle is contributing to more frequent and widespread light displays. A coronal mass ejection prompted forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert, with another potential aurora-producing event headed toward Earth. While severe storms can disrupt radio and GPS communications, the phenomenon offers a chance for skygazers to witness the colorful auroras, which are commonly visible near the poles, by venturing to quiet, dark areas away from city lights. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) has designated June as "Title IX Month" to commemorate the 53rd anniversary of Title IX, emphasizing the Trump Administration's commitment to protecting women's rights in education. This announcement follows recent controversies surrounding transgender athletes winning girls' competitions in several states, prompting heightened scrutiny of Title IX's application. The DOE will investigate institutions allegedly allowing males into female-only spaces, including the University of Wyoming and Jefferson County Public Schools in Colorado. The move signals a strong stance on protecting women's sports and intimate spaces, with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon vowing to fight on every front to uphold these rights. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has prioritized the project, pushing Japan and South Korea to invest and threatening tariffs if trade deals are unfavorable. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured, highlighting the opportunity for countries to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. by purchasing American energy. The Department of Defense is also prepared to support the project with offtake agreements to supply gas to strategic bases across Alaska. </p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following months of political turmoil, with the opposition's Lee Jae-myung emerging as the frontrunner. Lee, from the Democratic Party, faces ongoing legal cases and investigations for corruption, but his party already holds a parliamentary majority. His main opponent is Kim Moon Soo, from the conservative People Power Party, who has sought to distance himself from the impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol. The election is a significant step toward stabilizing the country, but the new leader will face daunting challenges both at home and abroad. </p>

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs, establishing a fixed price for delivering supplies. The agreement aims to foster greater collaboration among the agencies, improve their finances, and facilitate water movement to areas in need. The dispute centered on the price the Water Authority paid MWD for an exchange of water, which led to years of litigation and conflicting legal judgments. The settlement will provide fiscal certainty and new opportunities to address future challenges related to drought, infrastructure investment, and shortages along the Colorado River. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offices in California following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that closing the offices would negatively impact farmers' access to essential resources, given California's significant agricultural output. The administration cited cost savings as the initial reason for the closures, but ultimately rescinded the termination notices for eight of the nine offices. One office in Mt. Shasta remains under discussion. </p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which had contributed to recent flight delays and cancellations. Officials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems, and ongoing construction. The Federal Aviation Administration is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well, which could further increase the airport's capacity. To fully complete the project by the end of the year, the runway will still close on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months. </p>

          <p>Senators are escalating calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill, with Senator Lindsey Graham claiming that the Senate will move forward with legislation this week that would impose strict tariffs on Moscow. The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Richard Blumenthal, would slap 500% tariffs on any country that buys Moscow's energy products. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on President Trump to support the sanctions and a ceasefire. The "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025" has bipartisan support and aims to put Russia on a trade island by holding China and others accountable for buying cheap Russian oil that props up Putin's war machine. </p>
