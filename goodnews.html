          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are scheduled for parole hearings this week. Their original sentence of life without parole was resentenced in May to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole consideration. The brothers have maintained they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, a claim prosecutors have disputed. Family members have expressed cautious optimism, citing the brothers' remorse and personal growth in prison, while the final decision will rest with California's governor.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has submitted an improved bid of £40 million to acquire Brentford forward Yoane Wissa. The new offer consists of a £35 million initial payment with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. This follows a previous bid of up to £30 million, which fell short of Brentford's valuation of the 28-year-old player. Talks between the two clubs have resumed after Wissa, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, expressed his desire to make the move to Newcastle.</p>

          <h2>Growing International Recognition of Palestinian Statehood Aims to Bolster Diplomatic Solutions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:45:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Western nations, including France, Britain, and Canada, are preparing to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move that would align them with 147 other UN countries. This article argues that while symbolic, such recognition is a significant diplomatic step that strengthens the position of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) over its rival, Hamas. By endorsing the PLO's diplomatic path, the international community can rebuke Hamas's armed struggle and counter Israeli expansionist policies in the West Bank. This shift aims to revive the possibility of a two-state solution by creating a more balanced diplomatic landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of U.S. adults who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%. The decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record high of 53% of adults now believe moderate drinking is detrimental to their health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. This change is most pronounced among young adults, but older Americans are also increasingly skeptical of alcohol's purported benefits. The trend suggests that public health messages linking alcohol to risks like cancer are influencing consumer behavior.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) may see their payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOC rates are typically tied to the prime rate, which follows the Fed's lead, a rate cut could offer financial relief. However, the timing of this relief depends on the specific terms of the loan, such as the lender's adjustment schedule and billing cycle. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan agreements and ask lenders about their rate index, margin, and any potential rate floors that could limit savings. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates this fall will likely be influenced by four primary factors, according to financial experts. The Federal Reserve's future policy decisions and commentary, rather than direct rate changes, will set the market's tone. Key economic data, particularly inflation reports (CPI and PCE) and labor market statistics, will guide the Fed's actions. Additionally, investor activity in mortgage-backed securities and 10-year Treasury bonds will cause daily fluctuations. Finally, broader geopolitical events and economic trends that affect things like oil prices can also significantly impact the direction of rates. (not investment advice)</p>
