          <p>Japanese telecom giant NTT Docomo Inc. will retire its original set of emoji after 26 years, which played a key role in shaping digital communication. The company's Android smartphones and feature phones marketed from June will no longer include the Docomo emoji set. The firm stated that the emoji had "fulfilled their role," noting that Google's emoji had become more common globally, thus new mobile phones will adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead. NTT Docomo's set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024, Japan is reevaluating its disaster preparedness, with a focus on sanitation. The earthquake exposed the dire state of public restrooms, leading to unsanitary conditions and the term "toilet panic". Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets during disasters to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and ensure public health. Efforts are being made to educate elementary school students on how to use portable toilets, with the goal of preventing future sanitation crises during emergencies.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Some venture capitalists argue that embracing overwork is necessary for European startups to compete globally, however, many founders and VCs disagree, emphasizing the importance of sustainable innovation cultures and work-life balance. They argue that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through innovation rather than overwork, and that a focus on employee well-being is crucial for long-term success. Additionally, it is noted that startups need more funding and resources to compete effectively on the global stage.</p>

Originally taught by women, Sona is now being revived to challenge colonial narratives that erased African knowledge systems. The project aims to highlight the role of women in pre-colonial Zambian society and reclaim cultural heritages.</p>
