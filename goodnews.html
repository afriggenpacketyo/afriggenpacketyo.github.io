The company announced earnings of 20 cents per share and revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year. CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to robust consumer spending and growth in both merchant partnerships and customer transactions, highlighting successful collaborations with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to attend a military parade in Beijing, marking his first participation in a multilateral event with other heads of state. The visit, confirmed by both Chinese and North Korean state media, is seen by analysts as a potential indicator of a strategic realignment between the two allied nations. Chinese officials have warmly welcomed Kim's attendance, which coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule on the Korean peninsula. His presence alongside 25 other foreign leaders from nations including Vietnam, Pakistan, and Iran underscores a significant diplomatic moment for North Korea on the international stage.</p>

          <h2>Kyle Schwarber's Historic Four-Homer Game Avoids Controversy in Final At-Bat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 10:38:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves. He became only the 21st player to achieve this feat and just the fourth to have an opportunity to hit a fifth homer in the same game. In his final at-bat, Schwarber faced a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the blowout 19-4 victory. By popping out on a slow pitch, Schwarber averted a potential controversy that could have tainted a record-setting fifth home run, as hitting it off a non-pitcher would have been viewed by many as illegitimate.</p>

          <h2>India Utilizes Yoga as a Key Instrument of Global Soft Power and Cultural Diplomacy</h2>

          <p>Yoga, the ancient Indian practice, has evolved into a significant tool for India's global soft power and cultural diplomacy. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga on June 21 has elevated the practice to a symbol of Indian national identity on the world stage. This cultural export is seen as a non-controversial way to build people-to-people ties and project India as a civilizational force beyond its economic and political influence. However, some critics raise concerns about the over-commercialization of yoga in the West and its potential use for political agendas domestically.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, indicated that overall prices rose at a stable annual rate of 2.6% in July. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased slightly to 2.9%, its highest level since February. The report from the Department of Commerce also revealed a 0.5% rise in consumer spending, the largest increase since March, suggesting continued economic resilience among Americans. These figures present a mixed picture for the Federal Reserve as it weighs its next interest rate decision, with inflation remaining above its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders, a move that could pave the way for defender Marc Guehi to complete a £35 million transfer to Liverpool. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner has publicly stated Guehi must remain, the club is actively seeking replacements, suggesting a willingness to sell before his contract expires next summer. The England international has indicated he will not sign a new deal, putting pressure on Palace to avoid losing him on a free transfer. The club is in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also pursuing an experienced defender to bolster its backline.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported stronger-than-expected profits for its first fiscal quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. This growth was fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Despite overall revenues falling slightly below analyst forecasts, the impressive performance of the cloud unit and a revival in its e-commerce business pushed the company's U.S.-listed stock up by 10%. The results highlight Alibaba's successful strategy of investing in AI to drive future growth amid intense market competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade has joined Premier League club Newcastle United from Stuttgart for a reported fee of €85 million, setting a new transfer record for the German club. The 23-year-old, nicknamed the "two-meter Messi-Musiala" for his unique combination of size and skill, attracted significant interest after a breakout season where he scored 17 goals. The move is a notable miss for Bayern Munich, which reportedly had two bids for the player rejected. Woltemade's transfer is part of a larger trend this summer of top talent from the Bundesliga moving to the financially powerful Premier League.</p>
