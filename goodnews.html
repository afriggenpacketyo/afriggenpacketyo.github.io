          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, translating to an average monthly increase of about $56 for retirement beneficiaries. This annual adjustment, which affects approximately 75 million recipients of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, is intended to help benefits keep pace with inflation. The increase is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). However, the net benefit increase for recipients will also be affected by rising Medicare Part B premiums, which are often deducted directly from these payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders in London to bolster support for Ukraine's defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. The discussions focused on accelerating the delivery of air defense missiles and strategizing ways to further cripple Russia's war economy, particularly by targeting its energy revenue and utilizing frozen Russian assets. This "coalition of the willing" aims to intensify pressure on Moscow as the conflict nears its fourth year. Zelenskyy continues to advocate for more advanced long-range weapons to counter Russia's relentless airstrikes on civilian areas.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 09:18:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index rose at a 3.0% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than economists' expectations of 3.1%. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, with a significant jump in gasoline prices being a primary driver. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also showed a modest increase, suggesting that underlying inflation pressures are relatively contained. This data is seen as reinforcing the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Annual Inflation Reaches Highest Point Since January as Beef Prices Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 08:58:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Government data released Friday shows that U.S. consumer prices rose 3% in September compared to the previous year, marking the highest inflation rate since January. This figure, which was slightly below economists' forecasts, extends a recent upward trend influenced by President Trump's tariffs. A notable driver of the increase was a nearly 15% year-over-year surge in beef prices, while other costs like eggs saw a decline. The report highlights the economic challenge of "stagflation"—rising inflation combined with slowing job growth—complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates.

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has won a parliamentary by-election in Caerphilly, a constituency held by the Labour Party for 100 years. The result represents a significant political upset, with Plaid's candidate Lindsay Whittle achieving a 27% swing from Labour. The election was triggered by the death of the previous Member of the Senedd. The victory is seen as a major boost for Plaid Cymru ahead of next year's Senedd election and a substantial blow to the governing Labour party in Wales, weakening its majority in the Welsh Parliament.</p>

          <h2>Banana Prices Increase Over 5% Since April, Challenging Their 'Inflation-Proof' Reputation</h2>

          <p>Previously known for their stable pricing, bananas have seen a sharp 5.4% price increase since President Trump's global tariffs were announced in April. As the U.S. imports nearly all of its bananas, the market is directly impacted by these tariffs on major producers in Central America. This price hike is notable because bananas have historically resisted the inflationary pressures that affect other groceries. The increase highlights the direct impact of tariff policies on consumer costs for everyday goods, even those once considered immune to significant price fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, scoring in three consecutive games, but has yet to score or assist in the Premier League this season. His manager, Eddie Howe, and others have praised his big-game mentality on the European stage, where he has demonstrated impressive goal-scoring efficiency. However, his domestic form has been less productive, reflecting a broader trend for his team, which has scored more freely in Europe than in the league. The challenge for the 24-year-old English forward is now to translate his European success into consistent week-in, week-out delivery.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing fossils from New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America right up until the asteroid strike that caused a mass extinction 66 million years ago. By accurately dating the rock formations, researchers determined the fossils were from just 400,000 years before the impact. The findings, which include the colossal plant-eater Alamosaurus, challenge the long-debated theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. This research provides a snapshot of a vibrant ecosystem that was abruptly wiped out, offering new insights into the final era of the dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming segments. However, the company also revealed that overall sales volume was flat, indicating that some inflation-weary consumers are cutting back. The consumer goods giant observed a split in shopping behavior, with higher-income shoppers buying in bulk while others stretch their budgets by using products to the last drop. Despite this waning demand in some categories, P&G maintained its full-year sales and earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The concept of the "alien," from the grey-skinned extraterrestrials of folklore to modern artificial intelligence, reflects shifting societal anxieties and our relationship with the unknown. Pop culture depictions have evolved from Cold War-era invaders to empathetic outsiders, often serving as metaphors for themes like corporate greed, colonialism, or social exclusion. The term itself has political weight, used to describe noncitizens in immigration debates. Now, AI is being described as a form of "alien intelligence," raising new questions about our interaction with non-human minds that we ourselves have created.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, has expressed no concern over the recent dip in form of star forward Mohamed Salah, who has scored only three league goals this season after being the team's top scorer last year. Slot attributed the slow start to several factors, including significant summer changes to the squad and the departure of key teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold. The manager noted that while Salah is missing more chances than usual, he expects the prolific goal-scorer to return to his typical high standards soon. Salah's current seven-game streak without a non-penalty goal is his longest since joining the club.</p>
