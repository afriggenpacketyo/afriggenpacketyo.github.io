        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. saw a slight increase in May, primarily due to rising grocery prices offsetting lower gasoline costs. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.4% over the past 12 months, a marginal increase from April's 2.3%. Economists suggest that President Trump's tariff policies are expected to exert more noticeable upward pressure on consumer prices in the coming months. While gasoline prices decreased due to global economic concerns, grocery prices saw an uptick, causing some concern among economists (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing criticism from President Trump and his allies, but his recent address addressing the nation will likely improve his standing among Democrats. Newsom denounced Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, positioning himself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement. His actions are seen as a strong response to the administration's policies on immigration and law enforcement, and he has dared the Trump administration to arrest him. The conflict may help Newsom enhance his position among party members and potential 2028 voters.</p>

          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, central banks' increasing demand for gold elevated the precious metal to the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024. Central banks' gold stockpiles are approaching levels last seen in the 1960s. The ECB noted that survey data indicated gold was increasingly attractive to emerging and developing countries concerned about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies' role in the international monetary system. While many factors still support gold's value, there are indications that central bank purchases may decrease in the coming months (not investment advice).</p>

The agreement ensures passport checks will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the deal protects British sovereignty, supports Gibraltar's economy, and allows businesses to plan for the long term.

Economists anticipate that the tariffs will eventually lead to higher costs for companies and households, but the current report indicates a limited immediate impact.
