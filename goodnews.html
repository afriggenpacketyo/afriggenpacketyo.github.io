          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares rose significantly despite the company lowering its full-year earnings per share forecast due to expected $50 million impact from tariffs. The company's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with sales rising to $1.10 billion. Abercrombie is mitigating the tariff impact by diversifying its sourcing network, moving away from China to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. Despite the tariff-related challenges, the company is optimistic about future growth, particularly from its Hollister brand, and anticipates a return to growth for the Abercrombie brand in the latter half of the year.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.98%.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa policy targeting foreign officials responsible for censorship of protected expression in the United States. The policy aims to address instances where foreign officials issue arrest warrants or demand censorship on American tech platforms. Rubio emphasized that free speech is essential to the American way of life and foreign governments have no authority over it. The exact implementation of the policy remains to be seen, but officials from countries with a history of targeting dual nationals for criticizing their governments on social media are likely targets.</p>

          <p>China is launching the Tianwen-2 spacecraft to collect samples from the asteroid Kamo ªoalewa, which some scientists believe is a fragment of the moon. The mission aims to help reveal more about the formation of Earth and the moon. The spacecraft will attempt to scoop up rocky matter and return it to Earth by late 2027, making China the third nation to retrieve pristine material from an asteroid. The mission also has a secondary target, an unusual comet, and will help study the Yarkovsky effect, which can push asteroids onto Earth-impacting orbits.</p>
