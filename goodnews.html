          <p>In their final preseason game, the Los Angeles Lakers lost 117-116 to the Sacramento Kings, despite a stellar performance from Luka Doncic, who scored 31 points, provided nine assists, and grabbed five rebounds. The team, playing without superstar LeBron James due to a sciatica issue expected to last until November, utilized the game as a "dress rehearsal" for their upcoming season. Coach JJ Redick integrated Gabe Vincent into the starting lineup, where he contributed 14 points, while Marcus Smart showed improved form with 14 points off the bench after an initial slow start. This article highlights the Lakers' ongoing adjustments and individual player efforts as they prepare for a challenging regular season without their key player.</p>

          <p>Renowned theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize laureate, passed away in Beijing at the age of 103 due to sickness. Often ranked alongside Albert Einstein, Yang was celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to the field. In 1954, he co-authored the Yang-Mills theory with Robert Mills, a set of equations that proved as fundamental to physics as Einstein's theory of relativity. This article highlights his immense legacy, as the Yang-Mills theory described how three of nature's four fundamental forces operate in the subatomic world, laying the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model of modern physics.</p>

          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have significantly boosted their sales volume in the South African SUV market, growing by an impressive 86% between January and August compared to the previous year. This surge has elevated their total market share to 15%, primarily propelled by strong performances from Chery and Haval, whose sales increased by 27% and 45% respectively. The article highlights that while established Japanese leaders like Toyota and Suzuki still command the largest sales volumes, their individual market dominance is visibly diminishing. This trend signifies a substantial shift in consumer preferences and competitive dynamics within the automotive sector in South Africa. (not investment advice)</p>
