          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life after fires occurred at homes linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to the high-profile nature of the properties, with authorities treating the fires as suspicious and investigating potential links between them. The incidents include a car fire and fires at two separate properties in London, one being Starmer's private home. No one was injured in the fires, and the Prime Minister has thanked emergency services for their work, while declining to comment further due to the ongoing investigation. </p>

This shift reflects President Trump's national security priorities and aims to modernize the Army after years of counterterrorism operations.
