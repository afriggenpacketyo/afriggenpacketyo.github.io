          <h2>Trump-Aligned Legal Group Challenges Federal Hiring Practices Favoring Diversity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:30:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>America First Legal Foundation (AFL), a legal group aligned with former President Trump, is challenging a 1981 consent decree that ended merit-based hiring for federal jobs in favor of alternative assessments aimed at promoting diversity. AFL argues that the Luevano consent decree, agreed upon during President Carter's administration, results in less qualified candidates being hired. The lawsuit aims to restore merit-based evaluations, asserting that race and immutable traits should not be considered in the hiring process. The Office of Personnel Management has also sought to end the Carter-era system, potentially signaling broad support for merit-based hiring. This legal challenge could reignite debate over race-conscious hiring practices within the federal government.</p>

          <h2>RSV Hospitalizations in Infants Drop Significantly Due to New Preventative Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a dramatic decrease in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, linked to the widespread availability of a maternal vaccine and a monoclonal antibody treatment. Hospitalizations have fallen by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have observed fewer critically ill children and a reduced need for intensive care. The study suggests that the increased use of RSV prevention products could lead to even larger reductions in hospitalizations among infants in future seasons.</p>

          <p>President Trump is hosting a private dinner for the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP meme coin, but blockchain analytics suggest that many of the top wallets are tied to international exchanges and likely belong to non-U.S. citizens. Documents indicate that many top holders send and receive the token through exchanges like Binance that do not service U.S. customers. Justin Sun, who publicly acknowledged purchasing $75 million worth of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial token, is believed to be a leading holder of the $TRUMP meme token.</p>
